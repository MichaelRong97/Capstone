Through a pair of crude headphones, the latter device supplied an asynchronous soundtrack of \"hootchie-cootchie\" music. \\r \\r The Kinetograph camera here employed is so new -- even to its inventors \\r -- that director Dickson has drastically \"overcranked\" the film, unintentionally producing one of the first examples of slow-motion.\\r \\r Carmencita's titillating movements were considered by many to be \\r scandalous.

This short is a brief look at 3 workers as they go about their daily ritual. Great piece of work for its time. In the early days of cinema, directors typically recorded everyday events such as the arrival of ships or workers leaving a factory. These short films were called \"actualities.\" Later, with the advent of better equipment (which could record for longer), directors began to introduce more complicated narratives into film. 10* (10* Rating System)</td>\n",

Through a pair of crude headphones, the latter device supplied an asynchronous soundtrack of \"hootchie-cootchie\" music. \\r \\r The Kinetograph camera here employed is so new -- even to its inventors \\r -- that director Dickson has drastically \"overcranked\" the film, unintentionally producing one of the first examples of slow-motion.\\r \\r Carmencita's titillating movements were considered by many to be \\r scandalous.

I remember the movie being sold out when I saw it and I had to wait to get in to see it. It was well worth the wait, even as a six year old I could realize that. Toy Story was the first fully computer animated movie ever to be made. This was a huge impact in the world of special effects and art. That was part of the reason why this movie was such a huge success. The other reason for the huge success is because of the concept of the movie. Where else can you find a movie where toys come to life and have their own world inside of a little boy's room. This is one of the first movies to have that type of story. The other computer animated movies to follow Toy Story are A Bug's Life, Antz, Toy Story 2, Shrek, Monster's Inc., Ice Age, Shrek 2, The Incredibles, The Polar Express, and Shark Tale. After seeing Shark Tale, I figured out that computer animated films are starting to become a cliché. However, the Pixar movies are really good. The voice work in Toy Story is also really good. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are the perfect voices to fit the characters of this movie. This was also a part of Tim Allen's big uprising in the '90's. Every kid should see this, most kids that I know like this movie. Anybody else who somehow hasn't seen this should also see it to see where the animated films of today got started from.</td>\n",

As a computer animated film it was well ahead of its era (at least I think). Also, it was the first feature length film that was fully animated, and to this day is one of the best. With the success of this film it was no wonder they made a sequel, one that i enjoyed a lot!

Granted Toy Story 1 was extremely good it's just not a movie they should have came out with a sequel to. I am currently searching for pictures (scenes) from the movie because of my screen name I would like to find pictures of buzz with the pink hat on portraying Misses Nesbit. If anyone has these pictures could you please reply? I also believe that Toy Story 1 was the best movie because of the cool graphic's. I think that Disney done an exceptional job on the movie in parts where the Pizza Planet scene was taken because of the reality of the crane machine and the little green aliens. Also the kids in the scenes looked very real to, even though I think the mother of Andy had way to much animation in it.</td>\n",

Tom Hanks provides the voice of Woody the Cowboy, who is the ringleader of the toys around Andy's room. He overhears the important events around Andy's life and one of the things shocking is that they are moving to another home. Most of Andy's toys are compiled of average boy toys: from a nervous dinosaur name Rex (Wallace Shawn) to a grumpy Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickels), a smart Aleck piggy bank called Hamm (John Ratzenburg); even Andy's little sister has toys that join with the gang, Bo Peep (Annie Potts of \"Ghostbusters\" fame) has a crush on the cowboy. There are other characters in the story; a dog on a string name Slinky Dog (Jim Varney of \"Ernest\" fame) and a plastic army doll name Sarge (R. Lee Ermey of Full Metal Jacket). One of the elements of \"Toy Story\" is very psychological, and that is the fear of a new toy. Sure everybody likes to get a new toy, but the problem is that when people buy new toys, they automatically forget that their old toys exist and lose excitement within them. When Andy's birthday party comes a week before the leave, Woody sends Sarge and the plastic army men with the baby talkers to hear what kind of presents Andy has gotten this year. As Mr. Potato jokes that he wants a wife, the gang gets cut off by a nervous Rex and realize that the toys have to stay still. The new toy in Andy's life is the popular and all out, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) in which he pushes Woody to the side leaving the new toy on the bed. Everybody clamors over Woody being pushed off the bed as every other toy in the room tries to figure out what's up there. Woody is introduced to the new character as he tells everyone he can fly and fire a high laser. A smart-ass Potato Head makes a statement about Woody's voice box that it sounds a car ran over it. Days before the move, Woody is left out of the group as everybody including Bo Peep are all with Buzz Lightyear. Woody has a plan of getting rid of Buzz and he uses an electric race-car to push him out the window. Now every toy is against Woody and want to beat him up; but Andy saves Woody when him and the rest of his family are going out for pizza and can't find Buzz, so Andy takes the cowboy instead. With little relief, when the car stops at a gas station, Buzz has been hiding under the car and fights with Woody outside; suddenly the car leaves with both toys stranded. Buzz has a plan for both him and Woody to get back with Andy; they get into a pizza truck and try to find Andy and his family and notices that the neighborhood bully Sid is there so the toys hide in a toy machine where they are taken with another toy back to Sid's house where one toy is torture to death (relax, its not the main toys). So now they have to work together in order to be with Andy and tell the other toys that everything is all right. \"Toy Story\" is a blessing with delight and wonder and just like my review of \"Monsters, Inc.\" it's a movie of curiosity and a joy to behold.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hot Soundtrack, Terrible Character Development; Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end.  It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.  However, much of this is wasted on poor character development.  Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover.  What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies.  While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all.  For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script.  Clearly the answer is that it isn't.  Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with.  Why the director didn't see this, I don't know. Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface. 4/10</td>\n",

       "      <td>in response to your response; I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off...</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Best Movie of All Time; let me tell you.. anyone who does not like the movie is just a little close minded.. i read comments that thought the movie was too unrealistic but thats what makes it so great! i mean look at other movies such as lord of the rings or star wars neither or them contain true reality.. this is why its a movie. Anyway, i loved Steve martin in this movie. he does a magnificent job of playing the character for an over protective dramatic father. he was the best actor. who could have played the part of Nina as well as Diane Keaton. she makes the part of the mom annoyingly overwhelming mother, which is exactly what the point of us as the audience to think of her. martin short is the best of all \"fra'nk's\". the way he seeks George banks's approval is perfect. and lastly Kimberly Williams is the gorgeous daughter we are all expecting her to be.. i watch this movie every night before bed and i can recite every word to this movie. because of father of the bride II i have dreamed to meet Steve martin.. \"hes my hero!!\" hopefully you fall in love with it too. and dream to be pregnant with your mother as did Annie banks.</td>\n",

I was about six years old when this movie came out. I remember the movie being sold out when I saw it and I had to wait to get in to see it. It was well worth the wait, even as a six year old I could realize that. Toy Story was the first fully computer animated movie ever to be made. This was a huge impact in the world of special effects and art. That was part of the reason why this movie was such a huge success. The other reason for the huge success is because of the concept of the movie. Where else can you find a movie where toys come to life and have their own world inside of a little boy's room. This is one of the first movies to have that type of story. The other computer animated movies to follow Toy Story are A Bug's Life, Antz, Toy Story 2, Shrek, Monster's Inc., Ice Age, Shrek 2, The Incredibles, The Polar Express, and Shark Tale. After seeing Shark Tale, I figured out that computer animated films are starting to become a cliché. However, the Pixar movies are really good. The voice work in Toy Story is also really good. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are the perfect voices to fit the characters of this movie. This was also a part of Tim Allen's big uprising in the '90's. Every kid should see this, most kids that I know like this movie. Anybody else who somehow hasn't seen this should also see it to see where the animated films of today got started from.  \n",

I first watched this movie at about 2-4 years old, and I loved this movie. The storyline is excellently written, and always gets me laughing! The animation in this movie is incredible! As a computer animated film it was well ahead of its era (at least I think). Also, it was the first feature length film that was fully animated, and to this day is one of the best. With the success of this film it was no wonder they made a sequel, one that i enjoyed a lot! Also, I have heard that Pixar have announced Toy Story 3, and it will be a movie I will definitely see!  \n",

Toy Story 2 on the other hand gets a 2, it was the most boring movie there ever was... actually kind of depressing to. Granted Toy Story 1 was extremely good it's just not a movie they should have came out with a sequel to. I am currently searching for pictures (scenes) from the movie because of my screen name I would like to find pictures of buzz with the pink hat on portraying Misses Nesbit. If anyone has these pictures could you please reply? I also believe that Toy Story 1 was the best movie because of the cool graphic's. I think that Disney done an exceptional job on the movie in parts where the Pizza Planet scene was taken because of the reality of the crane machine and the little green aliens. Also the kids in the scenes looked very real to, even though I think the mother of Andy had way to much animation in it.  \n",

This movie was rated 'classic' because of the beautiful computer graphics, good voice acting and the exciting plot. The memorable and funny characters like \"Mr. Potato Head\" and Buzz Light Year, I will never forget them. Toy Story is the first movie made with computers and not using real-life actors, computers were not common when Toy Story on show, it was a great success. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. It gave us many imagination. This is the best movie I ever seen!  \n",
       "4    A delight!; Kids have always wondered if their toys ever came to life when they were asleep and if the toys themselves had lives of their own by doing the same things that humans do. Toy Story is the first film from Pixar Studios to make cartoons more humanistic with CGI than by drawing them out. Tom Hanks provides the voice of Woody the Cowboy, who is the ringleader of the toys around Andy's room. He overhears the important events around Andy's life and one of the things shocking is that they are moving to another home. Most of Andy's toys are compiled of average boy toys: from a nervous dinosaur name Rex (Wallace Shawn) to a grumpy Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickels), a smart Aleck piggy bank called Hamm (John Ratzenburg); even Andy's little sister has toys that join with the gang, Bo Peep (Annie Potts of \"Ghostbusters\" fame) has a crush on the cowboy. There are other characters in the story; a dog on a string name Slinky Dog (Jim Varney of \"Ernest\" fame) and a plastic army doll name Sarge (R. Lee Ermey of Full Metal Jacket). One of the elements of \"Toy Story\" is very psychological, and that is the fear of a new toy. Sure everybody likes to get a new toy, but the problem is that when people buy new toys, they automatically forget that their old toys exist and lose excitement within them. When Andy's birthday party comes a week before the leave, Woody sends Sarge and the plastic army men with the baby talkers to hear what kind of presents Andy has gotten this year. As Mr. Potato jokes that he wants a wife, the gang gets cut off by a nervous Rex and realize that the toys have to stay still. The new toy in Andy's life is the popular and all out, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) in which he pushes Woody to the side leaving the new toy on the bed. Everybody clamors over Woody being pushed off the bed as every other toy in the room tries to figure out what's up there. Woody is introduced to the new character as he tells everyone he can fly and fire a high laser. A smart-ass Potato Head makes a statement about Woody's voice box that it sounds a car ran over it. Days before the move, Woody is left out of the group as everybody including Bo Peep are all with Buzz Lightyear. Woody has a plan of getting rid of Buzz and he uses an electric race-car to push him out the window. Now every toy is against Woody and want to beat him up; but Andy saves Woody when him and the rest of his family are going out for pizza and can't find Buzz, so Andy takes the cowboy instead. With little relief, when the car stops at a gas station, Buzz has been hiding under the car and fights with Woody outside; suddenly the car leaves with both toys stranded. Buzz has a plan for both him and Woody to get back with Andy; they get into a pizza truck and try to find Andy and his family and notices that the neighborhood bully Sid is there so the toys hide in a toy machine where they are taken with another toy back to Sid's house where one toy is torture to death (relax, its not the main toys). So now they have to work together in order to be with Andy and tell the other toys that everything is all right. \"Toy Story\" is a blessing with delight and wonder and just like my review of \"Monsters, Inc.\" it's a movie of curiosity and a joy to behold.  \n",

It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.  However, much of this is wasted on poor character development.  Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover.  What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies.  While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all.  For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script.  Clearly the answer is that it isn't.  Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with.  Why the director didn't see this, I don't know. Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface. 4/10  \n",

And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :)  \n",

I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off...  \n",

Anyway, i loved Steve martin in this movie. he does a magnificent job of playing the character for an over protective dramatic father. he was the best actor. who could have played the part of Nina as well as Diane Keaton. she makes the part of the mom annoyingly overwhelming mother, which is exactly what the point of us as the audience to think of her. martin short is the best of all \"fra'nk's\". the way he seeks George banks's approval is perfect. and lastly Kimberly Williams is the gorgeous daughter we are all expecting her to be.. i watch this movie every night before bed and i can recite every word to this movie. because of father of the bride II i have dreamed to meet Steve martin.. \"hes my hero!!\" hopefully you fall in love with it too. and dream to be pregnant with your mother as did Annie banks.  \n",
