Through a pair of crude headphones, the latter device supplied an asynchronous soundtrack of \\\"hootchie-cootchie\\\" music. \\r \\r The Kinetograph camera here employed is so new -- even to its inventors \\r -- that director Dickson has drastically \\\"overcranked\\\" the film, unintentionally producing one of the first examples of slow-motion.\\r \\r Carmencita's titillating movements were considered by many to be \\r scandalous. Thus, the film prompted some of the earliest discussions of film censorship.\"}"

       "      <td>Playmates; The original meaning of a playmate that is of course. Pixar is inventive, Pixar does great movies. Well, you've heard and hopefully have seen it before. But if you have not watched a movie by Pixar yet, you are in for a treat. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy the movies they do. But they work as family movies, kids movies or just \"plain\" movies. It is only a matter of time until Pixar will win an Oscar. Not for animated picture (they've done that and will be doing it for many years to come), but for Best Picture (period)! Toy Story is a ... well story-fantasy that many kids have while they grow up. And to see that come to life (no pun intended), is just great. Especially because Pixar equally has treats for kids and grown-ups alike. You'd have to be a cynic to not like it, I guess. But if you do not have an aversion against animated pictures, you have to check this one out Came at a time when cgi was not doing well and changed the film industry; The plot is Woody, Hanks, a cowboy toy who is Andy's favorite toy but when Andy goes away, the toys come alive and are concerned because Andy's birthday is coming up and they are wondering who will be replaced. Woody is there to calm everyone down because he is Andy's favorite. Until a new toy called Buzz, Allen, shows up with all the latest in toy technology. Woody tries to fight for attention but thanks to this, they both get lost. The rest of the film is them trying to get back to Andy before he moves. The strength of this movie is the writing and these characters are amazingly written and are put in a great concept. There is only jealousy as the villain and this leads to great comedy. In my opinion, some of the best forms of comedy are made from competition and seeing these two characters trying to do the right thing and just being consumed by jealousy is great to watch. It was also clever and interesting. The film doesn't really have a villain. OK, maybe Sid, who loves to blow up toys, and you either knew this kid or was this kid when growing up. However, even Sid is just trying to have fun. So, he can't really be called a villain. That is why the writers are so good. They make everyone identifiable. The idea of toys coming to life is nothing new, we have seen it before but they put this wonderful little spin on it which just works. The CGI holds up pretty well. Sometimes. The plastic texture make it seem pretty decent but they needed to put more time into the humans because they look more plastic than the toys. That is just nitpicking. The film is still unbelievably good. The throw all their talent and all their effort into this movie. Especially in the writing and the characters, thus making it an animated classic. One that films try to copy even to this day. But this would be the first great success for pixar and the animated CG revolution had just begun. Wonderful Film One of Pixar's Best; I love animated Disney films, although I must say I usually prefer the original classic hand drawn Disney films, at some point we have to accept change, and what better way to accept this change with a wonderful superb film. (I mean common they booked Toy Story 4 already). Toy's come to life when their owner is asleep, and its all about the battle for who is the best and most popular toy. Whenever Christmas or the little boy's birthday come around the toys get nervous that they will be abandoned or replaced. When a new toy arrives they are determined to hate him and ignore him, but they end up becoming friends. Greatest animation film ever; Toy Story was the first full-length children's feature made entirely with computer-generated animation, and it was released in 1995. This film has an amazing plot, with great characters and actress which makes Toy Story the greatest animation film ever. Toy story is a buddy movie/adventure tale with an understated lesson about the value of friendship. \"You can count on me!\" Toy Story was about two toys, an old, beloved cowboy named woody (voice of Tom Hanks) and new beloved space ranger, named Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen). Both of these toys try and compete for the love of the human boy named Andy Davis (voice of John Morris) who plays with them, not knowing that they come alive when he lives the room. Toy Story takes place in Andy's bedroom where Woody is always placed on the bed and the rest of the toys are placed in the chest or on the shelves. One day the toys found out that Andy was having a birthday party and became scared that they might be replaced with newer toys. Woody the leader of the toys, calms the other toys down and sends a team of toy soldiers down stairs to scope out the new coming toys. As Andy is opening his gifts the most alarming arrival was brought to the scene when the new comer Buzz Lightyear was opened. Andy fell in love with Buzz Lightyear and ran up stairs and threw Woody off of the bed and replaced Buzz Lightyear in Woody's place. In the first half of the movie Woody and Buzz didn't get along and fought for the love of Andy and the other toys. As the plot takes a different direction when the family decides to move, Woody and Buzz find themselves stuck at the gas station with no idea on how to get home. This is where the theme of friendship takes over in the film. As Woody and Buzz starts to work together to find their way home Sin, Andy's next door neighbor picks them up. As the toys are placed in Sin's room they see Sin feed other toys to his dog. This is when Woody and Buzz join forces and try to escape the house before Sin feeds them to his the dog. Toy Story remains me of Avatar with the use of the computer- generated imagery. Like Toy Story, Avatar brought the characters to life with the use of all the different colors schemes, lighting and angles. Both of these films characters looked very human like and real and both won rewards for their use of animation. Sparkling family entertainment; Disney/Pixar initiated a new sophisticated form of animation with the 1995 box office smash Toy Story, a richly entertaining and imaginative animated adventure that not only spawned two sequels, but became a merchandising dream. The film opens in the bedroom of a little boy named Andy who is moving in a couple of days. The central characters are Andy's toys, who are led by a cowboy action figure named Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), who is apparently Andy's favorite toy. Woody and the other toys feel seriously threatened when Andy receives a space action figure called Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) for his birthday. Immediate antagonism materializes between Woody and Buzz when Woody feels he might be replaced in Andy's heart, but Woody and Buzz are forced to bond and actually become friends when they become prisoners of Andy's next door neighbor, Sid, a sadistic little kid who likes to torture toys. This deliciously imaginative story works thanks to a brilliant screenplay that brings vivid and believable emotions to toys, effectively showcasing the world from a toy's point of view. The jealousy and resentment between Woody and Buzz rings completely true and is actually the glue that keeps this story moving. Though the story provides consistent laughs, there are a couple of poignant moments as well...watch when Andy stops sleeping with Woody, who gets demoted from Andy's bed to the toy box or watch when Buzz sees a commercial for himself and finally realizes that he is a toy and is not real. As always with Disney animated films, the voice casting is perfection, with standout work from Hanks, whose work here rivals the voice work of Robin Williams in Aladdin...he makes us love and care for Woody and puts us in his corner from jump. Mention should also be made of Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Jim Varney as the Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as a very insecure toy dinosaur, John Ratzenberger as a piggy bank named Ham, and R. Lee Ermey as a toy soldier. Really liked Annie Potts as a Little Bo Peep doll too, though I just couldn't get past my trouble with the fact that a little boy would own a Little Bo Peep doll, but I did not allow this to deter my enjoyment here. Randy Newman contributed a couple of nice songs to the film, one of which, \"You've Got a Friend\", received an Oscar nomination. John Lasseter's direction and his contribution to the Oscar nominated screenplay are the final touches to this entertaining adventure that actually conjured up images of Spielberg work like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future, and though the story does have a couple of extra endings, it is a richly entertaining fantasy adventure that had me laughing and smiling throughout the entire running time. It was a beautiful movie!; I bought a 10th anniversary special edition of Toy Story a few years back when I was 8 or 9 years old. That was how I was first introduced to Toy Story. The movie was very touching and emotional. Listening to the developers' talking about how they made the movie and hearing the various reviews from many people about Toy Story was nice. I loved how Andy (and don't forget Buzz) never gave up throughout the movie, acting like most people in the world generally do (showing that toys are much like us), whether for the good or bad. I liked how the both helped each other and worked together in the movie. It was a great experience and I recommend that you who haven't watched it should. In the end, both realized their mistakes, admitted them and changed to become better persons. Sorry, toys. Good and groundbreaking; Good and groundbreaking computer animation graphics movie that delivers but does not reach a higher level due to the animation itself not having the \"warmth\" of the drawing style classic Disney animations.Still,the computer style here is very promising and quite impressive.Good story and script.A good solid start in a new trend in animation production.Very good voice acting.Only for fans of kids movies..... The greatest animation ever made.; This film amazed me it has one of the greatest scripts ever made it's lines are among the most memorable even though the two stars never met each other while filming was taking place and it brings together a fantastic cast including Tim Allen and Tom Hanks and an amazing supporting cast. The animation is completely perfect and the fact that it doesn't let itself be rolled into Disney Schmaltz too bad is another plus. a fantastic film with an unbelievably great script a real masterpiece and a great role model for other films too follow and a fantastic start for that studios career which has also continued with Monsters Inc and A bugs life if you haven't already got it go out and buy it. 5 out of 5 stars One of the Top Ten Movies of the 1990s; If there's any justice in this crazy world of ours, \"Toy Story\" will become a classic in the mode of \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Snow White.\" I look forward to its appearing every year on television, as a much anticipated \"event.\" It certainly is groundbreaking, what with imagery that must've taken a computer system dwarfing the pentagon's to do. But I love how well-thought-out this movie is. The plot works from beginning to end. The performances are terrific--Tom Hanks and Tim Allen don't just blather their lines onto the soundtrack, leaving it for the animators to do all the work. No, rather, they're really *acting* here, imbuing their characters with as much depth and breadth as if they'd been playing flesh-and-blood people. Keep a sharp eye, movie lovers, inside gags abound: When Woody runs from an escaped globe, you'll think it looks just like the giant ball sequence from \"Raiders,\" and you'll be right! When Buzz walks amid a sea of tiny alien squeak-toys, Richard Dreyfuss' close encounter \"...of the Third Kind,\" of course, should echo in your mind. The look of the movie *is* stunning--and, IMO, it \"works\" in every instance but one: Syd's dog. Instead of looking canine, he looks instead like a fur-covered football. I wish Pixar had spent a few more pixels refining his \"look.\" But all that's quibbling. Here's a movie for every kid who whiled away an afternoon while sprawled in front of a toy box and for every adult who ever wondered what happens to those Little Tykes people once you turn off the lights and go to bed... A resounding success; Pixar knocks it out of the park with its first feature film, about friendship, jealousy and the capriciousness of privileged white kids in a society of disposability. A clever, sharp and imaginative screenplay expertly voiced by a stellar cast (I would give this 5/10 just for casting Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head) keeps the swiftly moving story engaging throughout, flagging only a bit when self- deluded toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is briefly depressed. The film hops from one great set-piece to the next with head-spinning speed that leaves me marveling at how simple director John Lasseter and the team of animators make it look to bring these toys to life with just a few touches of individuality. Every viewer will probably have their favorite parts. Back when I first saw the movie upon its initial release, mine was the new-age toys who worship the Claw; upon recent viewing, I think it is \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" rendition of evil neighbor Sid's bedroom. It's hard to remember now that Pixar has proved so successful that there was real doubt about whether its style of computer-graphics animation would be embraced by audiences -- kudos to Pixar for proving the doubters wrong. Toy Story 1; I have to give Toy Story 1 an 8 b/c even though I am a grown adult, I love all types of Disney movies but this one nearly tops the charts. Toy Story 2 on the other hand gets a 2, it was the most boring movie there ever was... actually kind of depressing to. Granted Toy Story 1 was extremely good it's just not a movie they should have came out with a sequel to. I am currently searching for pictures (scenes) from the movie because of my screen name I would like to find pictures of buzz with the pink hat on portraying Misses Nesbit. If anyone has these pictures could you please reply? I also believe that Toy Story 1 was the best movie because of the cool graphic's. I think that Disney done an exceptional job on the movie in parts where the Pizza Planet scene was taken because of the reality of the crane machine and the little green aliens. Also the kids in the scenes looked very real to, even though I think the mother of Andy had way to much animation in it. fun; I love the movie toy story because it is fun and a good movie. I love the movie because woody found out there was going to be another toy for Andy and he was getting jealous. When woody saw the new toy he was really jealous because the other toys likes buzz and not woody. Woody wanted to get rid of buzz but getting to the end he regrets what he did to buzz and he went to save buzz and wanted to be friends with him. When the other toys ask for buzz woody always had an excuse and his friends found out that he wanted to rid of buzz so all his friends was really mad at buzz. His friends tried to find buzz. They found buzz in a pizza place where they had arcades and other stuff. When they found buzz woody apologized buzz and he wanted to be friends and be OK with everything. This Movie is Great!!; Toy Story was the best Pixar movie i ever watched! It has a good start where Andy has a birthday with his favourite toy: Woody. And Andy's Mom says \"Go Get Molly, the party is about to start!\" So Andy runs to his Room to get Molly. Woody realized he was not Andy's favourite toy anymore, So Woody wants to be Andy's favourite toy again! Woody had to find a way to knock Buzz out of the house, And Andy bringing Woody to Pizza Planet! So Woody was fighting Buzz, He realized he was a lost toy. So Woody Found A Pizza Car with a Spaceship on the top! So Buzz finds a Spaceship Claw Machine. Buzz found Alien toys in the Machine! The Aliens found The Claw! So Sid tries to get Buzz, But he got double prizes!! The Ending was great!! The ending had Andy moving in a new house, Then getting new stuff for Christmas, Then Woody And Buzz seemed happy at each other! rather clever; Great Pixar movie. I love the idea and the point to this animated feature. It's so good in so many ways. I remember it came out in theaters when I was three and wanted to see it so badly I couldn't sleep for weeks. This movie has been out for over ten years and I still enjoy it today as a teenager. It's great for all ages and brings so many laughs to a lot of young and older people. I especially love the part when Buzz Lightyear is in denial and thinks he is Mrs. Nizbet. That was SOOOOOOOOO funny!!!!!!!!! LMAO!!!!!!!!!! This movie is always going to be remembered for so long. Even the sequel was really good. I'm gonna have to post a comment on that on too. Anyways great movie. Loud laughs for everyone. My Favorite Animated Film EVER; I love Toy Story. Plain and simple, it's a phenomenal film. Not only is it one of the most well-made animated films ever made, it's also one of my favorite films in general. It's incredibly appealing story, the voice acting is perfect, the characters are very likable and fun to watch on screen, and the animation is stellar for it's time. The basic premise of TOY STORY is life seen through the eyes of a toy. The film centers around the toys belonging to a boy named Andy, particularly following his favorite toy, a stuffed cowboy doll named Woody. Woody is primarily the one in charge of Andy's room, but his authority is threatened when Andy gets a new spaceman toy named Buzz Lightyear. The only problem is that Buzz doesn't know he's a toy. He genuinely thinks that he is a real space ranger. Tom Hanks voices Woody and Tim Allen voices Buzz, and both do a stellar job. I couldn't ever imagine anybody voicing these two characters besides Hanks and Allen. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well, such as Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, and others. The characters are so fun to watch, and you truly care about them as you watch Woody and Buzz form a friendship. At it's heart, Toy Story is a buddy movie, and one of the best made at that. While the animation seems somewhat dated today when compared to PIXAR's more recent films, the film does still look very nice. Looking back at the film, it truly is a technological achievement as well as a film-making achievement in general. Being the first animated film done entirely through computers, Toy Story had a lot of expectations to meet. And not only does it meet expectations, it surpasses them to infinity and beyond. This Is A Great Family Movie; Imagine a world where whenever your back is turned or whenever you leave a room your toys come to life and communicate with each other like we do. Woody is the toy cowboy doll of a boy called Andy. Woody is Andys favorite toy until one day Andys birthday comes around and he gets a new toy which quickly becomes Andys favourite toy ahead of Woody. Woody quickly becomes jealous because not only has Andy pushed him aside but his fellow toy friends have chosen the new toy Buzz Lightyear ahead of Woody so now Woody plots a way to get Buzz out of the way for good with disastrous consequences. I will say no more about the movie as i feel if you haven't seen it then most of this film should be a surprise to you. All i do have to say however is Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz are superb choices as the voices of the main characters. This is an incredibly warm hearted and fun family film that a child of any age would love. Wonderful animated feature...; TOY STORY is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. It goes along with TOY STORY 2, TARZAN, A BUG'S LIFE, THE LION KING and CHICKEN RUN as some of my favorite animated features. Tom Hank s voices Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll owned by a boy named Andy who is the most-played toy until a space ranger, Buzz (Tim Allen) comes along and Woody is not good friends with them. But one day later, a mean toy-hating man who owns a collection of mutant toys and tries to threaten Buzz, and it is up to Woody to save Buzz with the help of the mutants before it's too late to escape to Andy's new house. The sequel is better than the original, but TOY STORY is a good movie. **** Cool A MUST see; I saw this movie when i was 5 years old a long time ago and I was so obsessed with Buzz Lightyear! I had toys of buzz Lightyear and carried them around anywhere i went.I saw this movie yesterday again and it was fabulous! plain fabulous. The story was amazing and the characters were well made! Nice job Pixar, You done it again! Tom Hanks did well doing a voice of Woody and same with Tim Allen with Buzz. I didn't really like Wall.E i almost fell asleep but this movie kept me awake the whole time with excitement! I recommend this movie to anyone no matter what age you are because this movie Just Beautiful! An fantastic awesome 10/10 The recent 3-D version of Toy Story just adds to a great experience!; When this initial computer animated movie first came out in November of 1995, I was stoked to watch this especially after watching a little behind the scenes short about it at Walt Disney World and besides, my birthday was near. What a wonderful experience what with the funny moments as well as touching ones and some intense ones concerning that sadistic kid Sid. And the use of many established comic talents like Don Rickles, Annie Potts, John Ratzenberger (who would become a regular Pixar voice), the late Jim Varney, and especially, Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. And as with previous Disney animated features, Randy Newman provides such an enjoyably compelling music score as well as several enjoyable songs with a great theme song in \"You've Got a Friend in Me\" that he warbled with Lyle Lovett. And the recent 3-D version just adds to the experience! So while this and Toy Story 2 is still (in its fourth week) playing as a double feature in theatres (with an entertaining 10-minute intermission of trivia and many other extras), I recommend you rush to the next showing as soon as you can! Greatest childhood memory; This movie reminds me of my childhood. I used to watch this movie almost everyday. This is great for kids and adults as well. I remember my whole family watching this movie. We used to sit together by the t.v. and have some quality family time. That was around the time when everyone seemed so busy with their lives. But this movie brought us all together. We were able to let go of everything and watch this movie. I show this to my baby brother and he loves this series. Whenever I hear the theme song I am brought back to the time of family bonding. When everybody had time for this particular movie. I still enjoy watching this movie at this age. I gave it a ten because it has helped me through so many times, it has been there through so many problems. I loved this movie and would recommend this movie to everyone. This review is to honor the movie the way it deserves to be honored. *This review has been stretched and has been dramatized to make the 10 line requirement. Just know that I really love the movie. That's about it* One of the best children's (and adult!) Disney animation ever created.; Toy Story is and will always be one of the best children's and adult's Disney animation ever created. As a parent, you dread seeing the same animated movies over and over again (kids never get bored seeing the same movie many times), but this one is different. I've lost track how many times I've seen it and it's just as enjoyable as the first time I saw it. Tom Hanks' voice is perfect for Woody, as is Tim Allen's as Buzz Lightyear and Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head. Love this movie and I don't think I will ever get bored seeing it. It's a perfect 10/10 from me. One of the Best Animated Films Ever!; Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen.  The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer.  The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen.  The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year).  Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with. The masterpiece that started it all; I remember seeing Toy Story opening night in 1995. 5 years have passed since then, and this movie is still awesome. I have matured in those years, but this film has not lost it's impact. It's so addictive to watch and so much fun. It has a wonderful voice cast, great animation, and an overall great story. It's a film I will watch for years, and it's one of my favorite modern animation films When toys attack.. or have fun.. or escape..; A classic. I enjoyed this, and the actual toys of Buzz when I was younger, and now I just rewatched the movie and I'm very glad that I did. Weird, it's almost Halloween, and this is far from horror. Anywho, this is one of the films that got people to know, There's a company named Pixar and they're going to rock the world of film and animation as you know it. This movie could be one of Pixar's best. Andy is moving and his toys are coming with him. But he gets a new toy for his birthday, but a week before since he wants to have his party before he move. His new toy.. Buzz Lightyear! And Woody is jealous because he could not be the favorite toy. But before you know it, Woody is lost on the way to a Pizza place when he was supposed to be going with Andy, and Buzz is joining on the ride. Now they must get to Andy before he moves.. or while he's moving. Oops, spoiled. A great animation. Really shows you why some choose 3d animation over traditional animation. Hey, you wouldn't want to see toy story as a 2d cartoon? Do you?  This movie was one of the best 3d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an 8.5.(I gave it an 8) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of 3d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! One of the most watchable(&amp; re-watchable) movies ever.; This movie has it all. Simple enough for children to enjoy, and yet with enough subtle humour for adults to enjoy as well. In fact, this film was made more for adults than for children I suspect-much of the humour is subtle and adult oriented, and as the makers admit, many of the toys are ones they played with in their childhoods. The toys in the film are actually better actors, and convey more emotion, than most \"actors\" in films today. Kudos to Pixar for an excellent job. A must-see film, it has something for everyone, and loses nothing on repeated viewing. I saw it 3 times at the cinema, and then bought it on video, and have probably seen it 50 or so times at home, and yet it is still funny, and I will happily watch it again.  My childhood!; I love this film. It has a few flaws. It doesn't look nearly as well as it did upon release. But I'll never forget watching this classic in the cinema. Pixar had a solid group of films dating over a decade (Cars not included), but I can always re-visit. Thanks Pixar for this brilliant premiere of a gem and for: - A Bug's Life - Monsters, Inc. - Toy Story 2 - Finding Nemo - The Incredibles - Ratatouille - WALL-e - Up - Toy Story 3 Yep! a wonderfully innovative movie; truly a delight; Clever, heartwarming story centers around a group of living toys and their perspectives on the world they inhabit, one in which attention from their owner is the essence of their very existence. An old-fashioned cowboy doll and longtime favorite of his child owner is threatened by the arrival of a sophisticated, high-tech space ranger. Despite their differences, they eventually realize that they need each other in order to overcome a dangerous predicament. On the surface it's the first film ever done completely with computer animation, but at its heart is a compelling story of friendship, love, and acceptance. Terrific songs, remarkable animation, and a perfect cast of voices make this an engaging experience for all ages. A family film and so much more. ***½ Toy Story 9/10, Toy Story 3-D 5/10- rip off; Let me explain. I love films. Toy Story is beyond excellent. Toy Story 3-D is perhaps the biggest con since Keyser Soze convinced the world he didn't exist. There is ONE SCENE in the whole film where you actually get the sense of 3-D and that is right at the end during a snow scene. If you have Toy Story on DVD or have seen it before, stay at home because you are seeing nothing new here. The thing that annoys me is that in addition to paying to see the same film that I own on DVD, I paid extra for 3-D glasses!! unbelievable!! it should've been a highway mans mask and a club. I implore you to stay away from this and Toy Story 2 3-D when it is out as I am sure they will just do the same again. Hands Down My Favorite Disney FIlm.; I just recently saw the Toy Story, Toy Story 2 double feature and it was amazing seeing this movie on the big screen after all this time. In my opinion this is the best movie Pixar has made so far, and it will be hard to top it. The animation is flawless and all of the characters are so lovable, you actually forgot that they are toys and not real people. The plot is actually really inventive and the idea of toys being jealous of one another is really fun. I think this movie is perfect for people of any age because the humor can be enjoyed by anyone. Obviously it's the perfect movie for kids, but it's great for adults too. Tim Allen and Tom Hanks lend their voices as the main characters in this film, and they are perfect in it. Overall, this movie is genuine animated classic! Created a decade ago, but still stunning; I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago. The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their \"leader\" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other... When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10. Hanks and Allen are hilarious even animated!; As if Tom Hanks wasn't talented enough...someone had the brilliant idea to animate him! Not to mention pair Hanks great sense of humor with comedic genius Tim Allen! Together, these two keep the giggles and laughs coming in this cute and successful Disney Pixar flick that spawned an even cuter sequal! Best Animated Film Ever!!!!; This is one of the best animated films I ever seen! It will always be better than the other two Toy Story films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are so good in the Toy Story franchise. Woody's sarcasm is the best part of the film as well as Buzz not knowing he's a toy. The story of this film is just something you wouldn't expect but then it is about toys, so it all makes sense. I will always recommend this film and the rest of the franchise to friends and family. To Infinity and Beyond! My favorite film as a kid and remains a classic today; As a kid, I remember watching the first two Toy Story films frequently and collecting all the characters from the movie. I found out that it was the very first computer-animated film about two years ago and assumed that's why the movie is still so popular. Woody and Buzz are what made the film what it was then and today and were my favorite characters. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is where Woody and Buzz are launched in the air from the rocket and Buzz frees himself to fly into Andy's toy box. The film remains a classic and always will be to me. I also cannot wait for the third movie to come out June 18, 2010 because I'll be the first in line. The film of a child's dream; All I can say is that I started my childhood with this film. And I can remember that my hole day i was thinking of the film in the clouds I could picture the film, in my dream i kept thinking of it. I say that this film completed a kids dream. And in the future I will surly show this film to my kids and if they didn't like it ..... well they must like it!!!! I started to learn English after I sow this film. And every time I remember my childhood and this film I could cry. So I am asking you to watch this movie and please make your kids watch it with you. And I really want a third film for toy story. And thanks for the producers for doing two parts of this film. If ever a movie was perfect, this is it.; Never mind that it's a kiddie movie.  It's a pioneer film from Walt Disney and worth seeing just on that merit alone.  The whole concept of the toys lends itself perfectly to the new medium of computer animation, not to mention the incredible marketing of it's toys. The plot and the dialogue keep producing laughter faster than Disney's releases of re-releases.  The end sequence ties in perfect with the open sequence, opening presents.  In fact, the whole concept was so solid, that the movie would have been just as successful if no big names had been cast.  Not that I'm complaining, I'm a fan of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, too.  But when you look  back at all the hoopla of the film, you kind of forget them.  You won't forget Buzz and Woody! Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition); Tom Hanks is an amazing animated movie with a well written script that is about the secret life of toys. The centers around Andy and his toys. Andy has a long time favorite toy named woody. Woody likes his situation till Andy gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear and Woodys situation changes forever, or so it seems to Woody. The animation is astounding considering that it was done over ten years ago (1995). I highly recommend this movie and I consider it one of the best animated made ever. The songs are a bit sappy but perfect for animated movies and the music is right on par. I definitely without a doubt give this movie 5 stars. Toy Story is the greatest Disney movie ever in my opinion! Looking forward to Toy Story 3 in two years!; There is absolutely no question about it, Disney/Pixar's 1995 hit film, Toy Story, is their absolutely best film in my opinion. Pixar, the visual effects studio based in Northern California, was best known for making short films with three dimensional technology, including some Oscar winning shorts. In 1992 a script called Toy Story was completed and Pixar decided to take on the challenge of creating the world's first fully computer animated motion picture. In 1995, that script came to life, and the rest is history. Not only was Toy Story a gigantic hit for Disney and Pixar, it started series of films that continues to amaze and bewilder children and adults of all ages. The animation was state of the art, and continues to look amazing to this day. The characters, Woody, and Buzz Lightyear, to the humor were all amazing. Pixar won a special Oscar for making the first computer animated film, and it led to many more films of it's type to this day. Pixar, don't make us wait, please give millions of children around the world what we desperately need, more adventures of Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Here's to many more Toy Story films in the future, including the upcoming Toy Story 3 coming in three years, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen returning as Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Bona Fide Genius; What can I say that has not been said about this superb piece of work? Pixar have redefined what animation is all about. The concept, the story, the writing and the voice-overs could hardly be bettered. The toys are real individual characters brought to believable life by the actors who voice them. Special mention for Tom Hanks as you really cannot separate his voice from Woody's character. It works on every level. Kids love it, as do teenagers, young adults and pensioners like me too. The songs by Randy Newman are not too intrusive and actually enhance the story and move it on too. The amount of work that must have gone into the brainstorming before production started must have been amazing. It would have been great to have an insight into all that. Everyone should be made to watch this - it has a lot to say about life and relationships. Best computer animated movie of it's time!; This is an all time classic movie. The characters can really hold the your attention. The bright colors are wonderful. There is never a dull moment in this film especially with Woody. The toy characters are so great an funny. I love the banter between Mr &amp; Mrs Potato Head. Buzz Lightyear is also an awesome character who is very courageous! This is a fantastic film I am a really big fan of Tom Hanks! A Toy in the making of another and more toys; Excellent voice match to character in movie. Could have more art and less same images repeat. Pixar is now faster than ever; 1995 a slower speed for animated film. Will watch again, but not over and over again, consecutively. Liked it on Facebook, happy go lucky and not afraid to be bold. Don't understand the likes and dislikes but willing to accept all criticism. My own personal review may be liked or may be disliked. The clearness and accurate manner for beautiful taste in dual role models for example Sid the evil kid whom abuses toys and Andy the kid who doesn't like to play rough. However, Sid's sister is quite an opposite to Sid as well; she being a girl and has a love for tea parties with her closest doll Friends. The jokes and laughter in \"Toy Story\" is what made this turn of a century animated film a door-buster into the the first \"digital\" animated films in history. Of course, one does grow old and the story is great passed on to your children in just about any house hold! this movie is awesome!the humor never bores!; i remember when this movie came out in 1995. i was seven at the time. i have loved it since day 1. actors such as tom hanks and tim allen bring sparkle to the show. they are both hillarious as woody and buzz. this movie is directed at both kids and adults. the humor never goes flat and it is never cheesy or corny. if you are a fan of tom hanks and tim allen or you just want a good laugh, than you shoud definitely watch this movie. you will not regret it. ********** out of **********. Not to be missed!!!!; This is probably the best effort Disney has ever put into a movie and it shows! The animation can not be faulted (I even noticed reflections in polished wood tables when the toys walk across them!) the attention to detail in this digital world was brilliant. The characters were hilarious and I still laugh in all the same places after multiple viewings. It's a movie about friendship and doing the right thing after you make a mistake. A valuable lesson for young children. The jokes for adults are spot on aswell such as the quick \"Blink and you'll miss it\" scene where Mr Potatohead mocks another toy by taking his mouth off and patting his rear end with it. The word \"A##kisser!\" immediately came to mind and I laughed for ages at that alone! It was also subtle enough for young children watching to miss it altogether which shows how cleverly this movie was put together. Can't wait for the sequel! 10/10 even better than Bug's Life (another Disney / Pixar collaboration) and that's high praise indeed!  The one that started it all; Toy Story is a gem of a movie from Pixar that is still as visually impressive today as it was when it was originally released over a decade ago. Computer animation was a new thing at the time but Toy Story proved that the medium was more than a novelty act and was going to be around for a while. Woody (Tom Hanks) is Andy's favorite toy until Buzz Lightyear, a spaceman voiced by Tim Allen, arrives on the scene. To quote Randy Newman's song from the film, strange things begin to happen to Woody when he loses popularity with the other toys and is accused of trying to kill Buzz out of jealousy. Soon things go awry for the toys when Sid, Andy's sadistic neighbor, gets a hold of Woody and Buzz. The toys have to learn to work together and forge an alliance in order to survive. Great story and voice acting all around makes Toy Story a classic. 9 out of 10. Mesmerized..; When I first watched the film, I was in love with movies. This is one of those films that one can watch again and again. All things apart, the most dazzling part of the film are its story. And when you mix it with mind blowing dialog delivery (voice over), then you serve an exceptional beauty for anime lovers. The voice over of woody by Tom hanks is the best that I have ever heard in any animation film. The story is the best in so many of the animation films till today. There is nothing in the film that you might dislike. The toy story series serves the true purpose of films which is to make people forget about their day to day worries. The characters in the film are an absolute delight to watch. Each and every character is designed so nicely with their respective roles that I am in love with the series. The essence of the film is simple and has been conveyed in an easy way. Looking forward for more films like these. \"A must watch for everyone, and especially kids.\" a movie that you will be talking about; this is a movie that you will be talking about i never saw a movie like this ever Toy Story is one amazing movie this is a movie that everyone will be talking about if you like Toy Story 2 and 3 than you you will like the first one it is a laugh out laud movie i never saw a movie like this ever it is outstanding it is a sweet movie go see this amazing movie today i never saw a movie quite like this ever it is like a dream come true this is the perfect family film it is a great movie for the kids to enjoy even if your kids are 13 14 15 16 17 18 or 19 they will still enjoy this amazing movie go see this 4 out of 4 star movie and a two thumbs up movie it is that good of a movie you have to go see Toy Story it is a must see for everyone it is a hoot there is nothing like this movie i am serious there is nothing like this movie it is one of a kind it is the best movie ever created i think so it is hilarious i laugh so hard it was that funny it should be called the number 1 movie in the world have a great day everyone Scmaltz-tastic 3D adventure ride falls a little flat over the years; I just watched Toy Story for only the 3rd time since it was first in the theaters, and as much as I liked a lot of the movie, it fizzles out over time for me. It's a very cute movie, mainly for kids, but it has a few chuckles thrown in for adults. The human characters in the movie didn't seem very realistic; their happy-go-lucky, suburban lifestyle just made them very flat and barely likable, especially if you grew up in a family unable to afford multiple toys. The voice actors were delightful, and their moods were directed very well, even for the plastic Army-men who don't show much emotion. The \"cannibal toys\" were very imaginative and creepy, so they served their purpose well. I thought the idea of the claw machine that housed the little green aliens was cute, how \"The Claw\" was their Messiah of sorts. The coloring in the film was vivid and incorporated some awesome day-glow tones that I had forgotten about over time. The ultimate reason to watch the movie is to witness Pixar's astounding use of 3D imagery, especially when they incorporate real-life effects onto the screen (i.e. The magnifying lens over Woody's face). There were some aspects of the film I didn't care for. The movie is only 77 minutes long without the prefaced, short 3D movie before it, making the story suffer and seem a little lacking. I found the music to be over-the-top schmaltzy and generic, but it is primarily for kids and the Disney crowd, so I guess it belongs here. Again, the character of Andy isn't very likable, other than the fact that he owns a lot of older toys that we made have seen commercials of as a kid. The story wasn't very mind-blowing, but from the vantage point of a toy on the run, it is imaginative enough. It's the typical Indiana Jones setting where the main characters always find a way to turn their two-steps forward into one-step back. The ending with the falling through the sunroof was very convenient and could've easily been the start of another obstacle they needed to face, for example. In the end, I like the movie for its presentation, but as a film, I was not blown away with originality or anything by its story. The messages that it sends about jealousy, envy, depression, fear, and questions about one's worthiness to another are the primary focuses throughout the movie, but it ends up just being another nicely tied-up package in the end, which is Disney for you. 5 stars. Perfect! A badge to be worn proudly by Pixar.; Of course my opinion, but truly,honestly perfect! It is an amazing standalone, kid, and Pixar film with all the great motifs of all. It teaches children good values about who are in the world, and mortality. It also appeals to all ages and has incredible animation for 1995, and also was great enough to be unforgotten all the way until now 2015, 20 years later. Buzz's realization that he is just another product to be sold in the world, is in my opinion, one of the greatest moments of movie and entertainment history. The movie gives you a lot of things to speculate on like is Woody a bad toy? Or can a movie have virtually no villain but the hero or at all? The choice is 100% yours and that is what I love most about the movie. It is absolutely timeless and unforgettable and I highly suggest watching it. Super family movie!; Toy Story is truly a pioneer of this type of movie. I don't know what it's really called but I think digital animation best describes it. From here, you have all the Shrek, etc. derivatives. Not only is the film irresistibly funny it is also has a clever story and unlike many movies of today you can watch this one over and over. The voices are done by a host of popular names that we all know and love. Some of the most popular being Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, and John Ratzenberger as Hamm. Jim Varney even lends his hilarious voice as Slinky the Dog. The story is about a boy (Andy) that gets a new toy (Buzz Lightyear) for his birthday. Andy's previous favorite toy (Woody) feels forgotten. After a series of mis-adventures the two find themselves away from the home and must learn to work together to find their way back. The film is followed by a sequel \"Toy Story 2\" and \"Toy Story 3\" which were just as awesome, if not more so than this one. 9/10 easily The cartoon that started it all.; I am not a kid but a kid at heart. Toy Story is one of the best animated movies around. This is the most creative movie for kids and adults. Toy Story 2 is better story than the first one, but equally imaginative in computer graphics. \"I'm not really from Mattel...I'm from a smaller company purchased in a leveraged buyout.\"; A kid's bedroom full of toys comes to life when humans aren't around; each toy, both new and retro-vintage, has his or her own individual personality, and they're all thrilled to meet the new member of the pack, birthday present Buzz Lightyear, who just may usurp Sheriff Woody in their pre-teen owner's heart. Disney/Pixar computer-generated cartoon has witty writing and incredible visuals to spare, though some scenes are heavy with chatter and the climactic race to catch up to a moving van is stretching things, even for a kid's picture. Still, some of the lines (which fly by at top speed) are very sharp and funny, and the star-voices (particularly Tim Allen's as Buzz) are uncanny. **1/2 from **** Entertaining for all; Cleverly crafted Disney production has plenty to laugh at for both younger and more mature audiences. The innovative idea creates a world in which children's toys come to life in their own universe; the bedroom. While the animation is not exactly state of the art any more, the pic benefits from some jovial, whole-hearted performances. Especially of note is the irrepressible Tom hanks as Woody, Andy's favourite toy (until now), and Tim Allen, hilariously deadpan as space ranger Buzz Lightyear, the new guy in town. The comedy stays fresh and lively throughout while there is always something happening to keep little eyes tuned. Infinitely watchable, as Disney often is. Tuesday, December 1, 1998 - Video Imaginative Breakthrough.; Toy Story (1995): Dir: John Lasseter / Voices: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Jim Varney: Breakthrough first fully computer animated film and what a wondrous triumphant visual thrill it is. It is a film for families that will appeal on different grounds depending on age. It regards a cowboy named Woody and the jealousy that erupts when Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear enters the room on their owner's birthday. Buzz is interesting because he doesn't realize that he is a toy. When Woody causes Buzz to fall out a window an adventure begins that eventually lands them both in nasty Sid's bedroom from next door where a dire fate awaits toys. Grand idea with imaginative filmmaking by director John Lasseter. Where the film goes wrong is its placing supporting characters as types with little purpose. The two leads carry the film with Tom Hanks voicing Woody who goes from important to jealousy to hero in an exciting climax. Tim Allen as Buzz brings much humour in his inability to accept what he is. There is a host of other toys that seem more like fillers. Don Rickles voices Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn voices T-Rex. Jim Varney of Ernest P. Worrell fame voices the loyal Slinky Dog. It contains a theme of love and friendship and for adults it addresses the future of films. Grand achievement, or as the toys put it, \"To infinity and beyond!\" Score: 9 / 10 A fantastic family film.; The plot:A wooden cowboy doll called Woody is a young boy's favourite toy, yet when his owner gets a space toy of an astronaut called Buzz Lightyear, Woody has been left out of his owner's daily live. Woody finds out that Buzz Lightyear thinks that he really is a space ranger.     Both toys are now fighting each other while being kidnaped by the next door nieghbour that hates toys and must work together to get back to their owner before they are destroyed. The view:A wonderful enchanting and nicely funny story about rivally between two toys that are animated very well, with the fact of the movie being the first that was computer animated, this movie is really for everyone that enjoys watching a film that the whole family will delight in. Great fun. **** Timeless; Here's another film I watched back-to-back every day for a couple of weeks, when I was younger. I recently picked up the DVD and was instantly pulled in again. I ended up watching it again two days later. Anyway, I must point out that watching it when you're a child and watching it when you're an adult will result in two different experiences. Watching it recently I laughed my arse off at jokes I didn't even know were jokes back then; even simple things like \"Buzz LightBeer\" can have quite an impact. Alright then, enough of that. The film is 100% perfect the way it is. The characters are so full of personality, so full of humanity, and how it perfectly expresses emotions of loneliness, rejection, and love through a couple of toys is astounding. The movie has a sort of episodic appeal to it, wherein each episode leads to one collective end. It also seems that the worst that can happen to our protagonists does happen. It makes for one unpredictable plot. There's plenty of darkness here, especially with the whole Sid scenario, or when Buzz tries to fly. Did I mention the soundtrack? Randy Newman was perfect for this job; the music has a childish aura to it, but also helps accentuate the emotions of certain scenes. Can't imagine why he wasn't asked to work on the sequel. Anyway, Toy Story has received countless awards, and it is my opinion they are deserved. The Best Kids Movie of the 90's; Despite being the first full-length computer-animated movie, the movie's strengths are its plot and characterization.  The technology is not thrust in your face and simply serves to support a truly excellent animated film. A classic. Proof that Pixar not only cares about the quality of their work,they care about our kids.; Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library. my Personal Favorite of Pixar's Work; I remember seeing this film at the ripe age of seven, and I was totally entranced by it. What kid would not have been attracted to that sweet of a premise? Released way back in 1999, it was totally different from the usual hand drawn animation, and yet still as vibrant, if not more so. Even now as an 18 year old dude I find it so amazing. Attention to detail has always been Lasseter's strong suit, among many I might add. But the greatest thing about this film was the life evoked into its unique and untouchable characters. With the voice talents of Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, as well as the hilarious Don Rickles, and the late Jim Varney, the voice acting was perfect and the dialogue was surprisingly intelligent throughout. What could be perceived more or less as a simple story is told with heart and humor, one that hasn't aged a bit since that first viewing. I still own my original VHS copy in fact, but perhaps it's time I buy it on Blu-ray or DVD. Cynical and disturbing; This is one film that left me with a very sour aftertaste.  Yes, it's animated with character and vigour, and there are some fine -- if over the top -- voice performances.  However, there are some very disturbing aspects to the film.  The first is that it's like nothing so much as watching a 90 minute advert.  Even if merchandising hadn't been released to support the film, all the supporting cast could already by bought in your local toy shop.  I'm sure I wasn't the only viewer who found this more than a little suspect. Possible spoiler: The second, perhaps larger, point against the film lies in the characterisation of the two boys, Andy and Sid.  Andy is the \"good\" boy. He plays safely and passively with his toys, they don't do anything toys wouldn't do.  Sid, the \"bad\" boy is more creative.  He adapts toys to fit his own vision, he's an innovator, a creator.  It's this very creativity of his that is portrayed as a bad thing.  Sid isn't the ideal target audience for this film: he wouldn't be satisfied with row after row of identical shop-bought toys, he would much rather make his own.  I guess this review is being written for all the Sids out there, who are demonised and vilified by this ultra-corporate nightmare of a film. You've got a friend in me; \"Reach for the sky\"! The opening statement of Woody (Hanks) a toy cowboy during a boys playtime. A statement that proves to be ironic when he later looks up at a toy from space, Buzz Lightyear (Allen). Woody's owner is growing older and Woody struggles to accept the change as Buzz becomes Andy's new favourite toy. Leading from the once strong leader into a bout of jealousy and even malice as he tries to take Buzz out of the picture. Woody is then separated from Andy via a fight with Buzz and has to find a way home. Further change occurs as Woody is forced to align with Buzz to escape the toy antagonist Sid. It takes 3/4 of the movie for Woody to finally change his ways, and work with Buzz for the final great escape. Woody's journey from leader to outcast to redemption is intriguing to watch unfold. His final monologue with Sid was beautifully written as the toy out wits the boy. The whole irony of his story is that a child's mind is fleeting and 10 minutes of playing with Buzz and Woody would have been in the game again. For me it is Buzz that follows the greater path of change. Noble and confident throughout mostly due to being under the illusion he is an actual space ranger. Kudos to the writer who decided to take a toy from this world and make him believe he is real! Simple but incredibly compelling. Buzz's final realisation that he is a toy is arm breaking for him but heartbreaking for us. For a family movie Buzz's breakdown is surprising and well delivered and the journey back to being he hero has Buzz literally \"Reaching for the sky\". With us the viewers figuratively as we are up there with them cheering the final events. Woody and Buzz's journey home is supported by a cast of toys, each with a filled out personality. Loyal Slinky being one of my favourites, always reluctant to turn on his buddy Woody like the others. It's the direction of John Lasseter that puts us into this world. When Woody shouts \"You are a toy\". It's John speaking to us. From the beginning the camera is at ground level. We are not supposed to be a child watching his toys come to life but an actual toy, low level shots panning up throughout give a feel to the vastness of a toys world. We are right there through each playtime, adventure, triumph and failure and by the end Buzz may be flying but we are falling for these toys, in style. The story and characters are a success but the triumph is the medium in which the story is told. Through 3d animation, never before seen feature length. The Pixar animators made a bedroom and a pizza planet truly realistic. They brought toys to life in movement and texture. But most astonishing of all, they made us care for a bunch of 3d shapes put together through countless hours of rendering in a computer. The result is a metaphor for change, not just in the story itself and it's characters but in the medium it is told. The great change from 2d to 3d animation which is now common place for feature animation. This movie is a game changer for cinema and animation alike. Walt Disney and co did it in 1938. 54 years later John Lasseter and co did it again. The possibilities for 3d animation in film are Infinite, and Beyond...? Another Childhood Favorite!!!; I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since. It has a great storyline. Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, and many more. On Andy's Birthday, he receives a Buzz Lightyear action hero, and Woody becomes jealous because he isn't Andy's favorite anymore. When Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, his friends want nothing to do with him. On the way to Pizza Planet, Buzz confronts him in the family van, and knocks him outside and the family drive off without them. They go through a lot trying to get back to Andy before they move. When they end up in Sid's room, the kid who tortures toys, Woody and Buzz must work together in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TOY STORY!!! On it's 20th Birthday, Toy Story still soars To Infinity and Beyond!; In 1989, Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help. They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as \"Toy Story\", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about. First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the \"I'm Mrs Nesbitt\" sequence and the \"You Are A Toy\" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies \"You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic \"To Infinity and Beyond\" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history. There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's 81 minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" and \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" hit the right notes by being memorable songs. Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school. Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late 2000s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy 20th Birthday. Absolute perfection!; Hard to believe it but this, one of my all-time favorite movies, is already five years old.  And you know what, it's aged beautifully. Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest animated films of all time.  And not only that but it's also one of the funniest comedies (animated or otherwise) ever written.  I remember when this first came to theaters and everyone came to see the animation.  Don't get me wrong, \"Toy Story\" would still get a solid ten (if only the ratings went to 11) on eye-candy value alone.  However, the thing that gets me watching it over and over is the script. In short, this is the one animated movie that's *almost* more quotable than \"the Breakfast Club\". I can't imagine that there are people out there that haven't yet seen \"Toy Story\", even though I've met a few.  Go watch it, already!  You can thank me later. This movie is *perfect*. Instant Classic; Every company has that one movie that puts them on the map. That is what Toy Story did for Pixar. Toy Story is a cartoon about a little boy's toy collection that is alive when the little boy is not around. His name is Andy and he loves his toys, and they love him back. Woody is a cowboy and is Andy's favorite toy. The toys always get worried every Christmas and birthday because they fear they will be replaced by a bigger and better toy. The story starts off with Andy's birthday party and all of the toys are on edge. It turns out that a new toy by the name of Buzz Lightyear challenges Woody as the favorite toy. Buzz comes along, steals a little bit of the spotlight and Woody gets incredibly jealous. Eventually Woody and Buzz get lost and must find their way home and back to Andy before he and his family move away forever. Let's start with the toys. I loved these toys. Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Little Bow Peep, Woody, Buzz, Slink, Ham, and even Etch-a-Sketch are the main toys and each are lovable and different. Rex is hilarious because he is ironic. He is a dinosaur but he is a wimp, and he is my favorite of the toys. I remember watching as a little kid and I was always excited to see Rex on screen. Each character has their individual role. There are also toys every kid can relate with and that make the movie special. For example, the barrel of monkeys, the small soldiers, the etch-a-sketch, and Mr. Potato Head are toys every kid used to play with. The smaller toys aren't really relevant for long but when they are seen in the beginning and end of the movie their impact is huge. One of the major themes in the story is jealousy and the relationship between Woody and Buzz. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the favorite toy. Woody is a cowboy with a pull string that says some catch phrases. The other toys look up to him, he is a hero, and Andy loved him with all his heart. Andy dresses up like a cowboy, has Woody posters, and is obsessed with this toy. Woody embraces the love; it defines him, gives him confidence, and confirms that he is the leader. Then Buzz Lightyear comes into the picture with his better quality of a toy. He doesn't have a pull string, but a button Andy presses to have a better sound quality voice box will speak catch phrases. He is made of plastic, which is more durable and he has wings pop out which can simulate flight. Woody becomes incredibly jealous of Buzz and fights for Andy's love. He eventually knocks him out the window. Toy Story may be a kid's movie but it has an interesting and entertaining premise, especially with its characterization. Woody and Buzz both develop into better and stronger characters. Woody goes from a pompous, jealous, selfish, toy, into a respectable and lovable character. He and Buzz become best friends and inseparable, a little cliché, but it's a movie for families so it's perfect. When Buzz first appeared he thought he was a real \"space ranger.\" He was convinced that he was not a toy, he could really fly, and he had a dangerous \"laser\" which was really a blinking light bulb. He develops and he eventually accepts the fact that he is a toy but he is a \"cool toy.\" He is \"Andy's toy.\" Woody admits his jealousy to Buzz and that becomes a turning point in their relationship. We have our villain in the movie, Sid. This kid is just evil. He is a spoiled kid who \"terrorizes toys, just for fun.\" One scene we the toys in Andy's room watch him as he straps firecrackers to a Commander Carl and it explodes. First of all, what kind of nine or ten year old kid plays with explosives? If he isn't nine or ten, what is he doing playing with kid toys? He may tear them apart and put different parts on them, making them scary and horrific for children to even see on screen, that just doesn't make sense. His character fits for a children's movie but in reality a kid like this would never exist in real life. Sid is really my only problem with the movie, but still a character needed for the film. Overall, Toy Story is a classic and put Pixar on the map and was the beginning of a highly successful company. It came out in the 1995 and families everywhere fell in love, including me. It is a movie that can be watched again and again no matter what age. It is a movie kids will show their children when they are older. Teenagers lined up to see Toy Story 3 years later because it meant so much to them back when they were little. Toy Story and its characters left a rare imprint on the hearts of people all over the world. Without a doubt, Toy Story gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and goes down as one of my personal all time favorite animation movies. Toy Story; The story is about toys. The boy who named Andy has toys and enjoys playing with them. To be surprised, their toys can talk and act freely. Nobody of human know the fact. Woody who is Andy's cowboy toy spends a good time, however, Andy's new toy appear for Woddy. The toy's name is Buzz Lightyear. Woody and Buzz fight all the time and loses sight of their family and toys. They tries a lot of ways to meet their family and toys. The film is a long film by Pixar Animation Studious. The genre of the movie is animation, comedy and fantasy. It has dialogue and colors. It has sound effect and it is good to use the way of music. I like the scene that Woody and Buzz success in getting into a car that Andy rides. The film can be enjoyed by only children but also adults. cute; The movie is so cute. The story is about toys. A lot of people had a lot of toys when they were young or they may still have some toys yet. Also, a lot of children have a lot of toys now. Therefore a lot of people can enjoy watching this movie. Not only children but also adult and elder people are interested in the story. There are always a lot of toys around us, so we don't think about toys a lot. \"Toy Story\" indicates toys' feeling. If we use our toys rough, toys may be sad. If we cherish our toys, toys may be happy. By watching this movie, the audience can understand about toys. It is good movie. Children in the movie is young, so people who go to kindergarten or elementary school know how to treat their toys by watching the movie. After watching this movie, I love my toys and I notice that it is important for me. Best Disney ever; Finally a Disney movie which isn't moralistic but just fun to watch. Also it doesn't have the boring \"sing-along-songs\" so this movie is also a perfect movie for anybody about 10 years and (much) older. I really liked the computer-generated graphics because the characters moved very smoothly, something which can't be done the original way. More of these masterpieces in the future please and I will really like Disney at last, but dont't make it to moralistic and musical. That this movie is above all the other Disney -movies in the IMDB top 250 is proof of that. Good, Creative charm for kids and adults!; I'm not a huge fan of animated films, so coming into Toy Story I had very low expectations. At first, I thought it was Meh. Then, as the movie progressed it got better and better. Buzz is funny, Woody is a good cowboy, Sid is awesomely evil. Toy Story has an amazing cast as well. I mean, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, AND the Amazing Don RICKLES as Mr. Potato Head! Toy Story keeps kids and adults on their feet and I'm praising it so much because I have never seen any ANIMATED film as good as Toy Story so far. Disney really worked their magic into this classic. Toy Story FTW. I'm going to go rent Toy Story 2, and see if this film series has advanced even further. Pixar kick ass!; Yap. Those talented people at Pixar shows us that computer animation can be just as alive and creative as drawn animation. People think that the computer \"does all the hard work\", but that's not true. 3D animation can be just as difficult, if not more. The voice talent people are great and the animated characters clicked well with the pre-recorded voices. Everything from the toys' facial expressions to body postures is done well, but the real success of the movie comes from a perfect script. As long as the same creative team sticks around, I wouldn't mind ENDLESS sequels to TOY STORY. Cute Family Movie; Toy Story is a great movie for children and adults. Children will enjoy it simply because it is a cartoon. They will find it exciting because it shows toys coming to life which is something every child pretends with their toys. It's a good movie for children because it teaches them about jealousy, friendship, and teamwork. Adults will appreciate the animation and the accuracy of the details in the toys. Most of the toys used in this film were ones most people had as children. Such as, Mr. Potato head, the slinky dog, etch-a-sketch, and the army men. The theme of Toy Story is friendship. The movies theme song was titled \"You've Got a Friend in Me\". The friendship in this movie is about overlooking insecurities and finding a true friend in someone that you think would be your biggest enemy. A 2001 movie called Monsters Inc. is directed around this same theme. A little girl named Boo should be afraid of the monsters as much as the monsters are afraid of her but they form a friendship that overcomes their differences. Toy Story is about the lives of toys owned by a boy named Andy. Andy is having a birthday and he gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear. Andy's toys worry about him getting new toys because they are afraid they will get lost or donated. With the arrival of Buzz, Woody fills that Andy will like Buzz better. He tries to lose Buzz but instead he accidentally knocks him out of a window. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were brilliantly matched for being the voices of Woody and Buzz Lightyear. The personalities of the actors and characters seemed to be a perfect fit. The other toys in the movie, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky dog (Jim Varney), Pig named Ham(John Ratzenberger), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), and Bo Peep(Annie Potts), feel like Woody did this on purpose because he was jealous of the attention Buzz was getting from Andy. In order to make things right Woody realizes he needs to get Buzz back. Woody and Buzz both wind up separated from Andy and this is where their adventure begins. From this point on they work together to get back to Andy's before his family moves. Along the way Buzz realizes that he is not a space ranger but a toy. Woody tries to help Buzz understand that he is not just a toy and that he is very important to children. Woody convinces Buzz that they must get back to Andy. At the conclusion of the movie, Buzz and Woody are helping each other make it on the moving truck. They finally make it next to Andy who is excited to see both of them. Toy Story is about the friendship that is formed between Woody and Buzz. Once Woody was able to get passed his insecurities he realized that Andy could have two favorite toys. The motif of friendship is displayed throughout the movie by the relationships between Woody and Andy, Woody and all the other toys, and between Woody and Buzz. They also form a friendship with the strange toys at Sid's house. This movie is a true example of friendship. Really Sweet Movie!; Whether you're a fan of animated Disney movies or not, this movie is brilliant! It's great for family time movies or great for the everyday average Disney fan. The characters are put together very well. After I saw it, it made me actually think about throwing out old toys. I've been a fan of this movie ever since I was born(it was really big then) and I still watch it from time to time. I would definitely recommend this to anybody. Still Entertaining after 15 Years; I saw Toy Story in theaters in 95. As a kid it was funny, and original not just in story but in presentation. After 15 years the cg doesn't hold up in all areas. The human characters look stiff and the way background looks a bit flat. This plastic look works with toys so it doesn't become a problem. The movie holds up in every other area. The plot is engaging and the characters funny and likable. Toy Story is a family film it funny for children without talking down to them and enjoyable for adults. As a twenty something year old it is just as entertaining as when I first saw the original release. Fun for all ages; Toy Story is a classic among kids and adults, a classic among animation and simply one of the highest rated movies of all time. At first thoughts I felt yeah sure it is great but then after a little more time I came to realise this is incredible, I won't say it's 100% perfect but still it just exudes this feeling of well, fun. It's the kind of movie that only after do you really understand how Woody feels and how Buzz feels, you also realise how easy it would be to watch it again because it's really a calm but also an exciting watch. It's hard to call this a kid's movie owing to the fact that all fans of this back in the day are fully grown adults now, but the fact that they still return to this and say it is a masterpiece even today, well it shows how impressive this really is as well. The story is of course about toys, and in particular a new toy arriving because Andy the toys owner got a new Space Ranger named Buzz Lightyear for his birthday. Woody the favourite toy of Andy is jealous of Buzz's new found fame among all the other toys and starts to both feel angry but also kind of obsolete as well. The story moves along at a frantic pace, the amount of things that happen though to say this has an 81 minute run time is amazing and the timing is absolutely wonderful. Another point I found only after thinking back on the movie was the humour and how is just really good, one moment in a certain pizza restaurant arcade where we see a \"Whack-a-Alien\" game in reference to \"Alien\" sums up the overly kidult tone this movie possesses. Among the voices we have Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, Don Rickles as a small potato toy, Wallace Shawn in his trademark voice as Rex the dinosaur toy and the smoky voice of Jim Varney as Slinky the well, slinky toy dog. The voices are very memorable and the voice cast are perfectly picked, none seem out of place and maybe that is because of how much this movie has dug itself into film culture. I found Hanks and Allen's voices to be at the same level as each other only because they are both so great, Buzz is made even more courageous sounding by Allen and Hanks provides a kind of cool kind of toy voice but also brings out Woody's scared side or angry side well. John Lasseter the director is among many names behind this movie who seem to all hit the right spot with this, they create the first animated feature length picture and turn it into one of the still most popular of them all. The writers hit the movie from another flank, Lasseter brings humour out from his vision but I think the writers, Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow really bring another face to the movie where the humour but also the emotion can mix really well. As animation goes it of course does not look as it maybe did back then (still isn't bad though), although it doesn't matter anyway because it is the storytelling that blows you away and the characters really grab your attention. Pixar kicked off their stellar works in animated movies in style and brought not only a new way of making a movie, but also a fine way of telling a story and not making it over the top or just for kids, this is for everyone. There isn't too much too find wrong with this I mean, maybe some of the jokes aren't great, but really they may be still good anyway, it is kind of a movie that you can easily watch again without feeling it will quickly become boring, the kind of movie that is fun for quite literally, all the family. Great Fun For Kids And Adults Alike; Toy Story is one of those rare animated movies, designed for children, that adults can enjoy. Plot In A Paragraph: Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) is 8 year old Andy's favourite toy, however his world falls apart when Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) figure for his birthday and he has to play second fiddle to the new space ranger. I loved this movie. Over the years I have watched it with both my kids and nieces and nephews and they have all enjoyed it. Watching it now, it has lost none of its charm. Tom Hanks is superb as Woody, Tim Allen (who I'm not a fan of) is delightful as the deluded Buzz Lightyear who is not aware he is an action figure, but for me the stand out voice was John Ratzenberger as Pork Chop the Piggy Bank. Excellent Viewing, Every Time!; This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too. When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides. The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as \"Woody\" and Allen as \"Buzz Armstrong,\" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc. Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed \"winner\" as is the sequel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A treat for fans of family fantasy fun.; As a child, Alan Parrish becomes trapped inside Jumanji, a magical board game he finds discovers buried in a building site. 26 years later, Judy and Peter Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce), two orphaned kids living with their aunt, discover the game in the attic of their new home and begin to play, freeing the now-grown-up Alan (Robin Williams) in the process. Unfortunately, they also release a host of dangerous animals, deadly plants, and an unstoppable bloodthirsty hunter. Their only hope of survival is to finish the game, whatever the risks. Action packed, funny, heartwarming and even a little scary in places, Jumanji is an excellent family adventure for the whole family, and one that, thankfully, doesn't rely solely on its special effects to impress (a good job, since quite a bit of the CGI is looking rather dated). The story is engaging (with a nice time-travel style twist at the end), the cast is great (with Williams managing to give one of his less irritating performances), and once again director Joe Johnston delivers a final product that, whilst not a classic, is still thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb. A walk in the memory lane; We (me and my brother) used to watch a cartoon named \"Jumanzi\" every Wednesday, back in 2000. Watching this movie talk me through a walk in my memory lane. The great Robin Williams also makes me nostalgic. 26 years, struggling and surviving, and than fighting back to get their life back. It is called human spirit. Though, every bit of it is fantasy, the plot become more human, when Robin remembered his saviors, who give him another chance in the game. Really good movie; Jumanji is a really good movie. I read the book and saw the movie and they are both really good. It got a little weird at times but only a few parts. I liked Robin Williams in this movie. The FX is cool. The monkeys don't really look real. You can tell it was computer generated. Over all it was good. It kept you on the edge of you seat. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good adventure movie for kids. Think of it as Night At The Museum meets a board game; Jumanji is based off a cartoon TV series that was made into a film in 1995 and stars funnyman Robin Williams who plays a man called Alan Parrish who as a kid played a board game called Jumanji which was been buried since 1869 with his friend Sarah(Bonnie Hunt)in the year 1969.But when Alan plays the game he gets sucked into it as his friend Sarah watched in horror as each time the player plays the game consequences occur and the only way to finish the game is to play the whole thing. Fast forward 26 years later in 1995 and two young children played by Kirsten Dunst (from the Spider-Man franchise)and Bradley Pierce who's parents died along time ago are now living with their aunt as their aunt bought Alan's old house.But when the two kids stumble across the board game as they hear the drums playing in the background in the attic,its up to them to try and finish off where the player left off and free Alan who helps them finish the game with his friend Sarah. But will they finish the game. Overall this film is really good until the very end which was sorta confusing for me. If you seen it you know what it is but it involves time travelling back to 1969 and then back to 1995 again. But still if you are a fan of Fantasy movies,Robin Williams and if you love something to keep you entertained on a lazy Sunday afternoon Jumanji is worth checking out. Outrageous fun; When young Alan Parish and his childhood friend, Sarah play a board game that Alan found buried near his fathers business, Alan is sucked into the game and left to grow up alone in the jungle. That is until two young children, Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) join the game and release him 26 years later. Every turn in the game becomes a living nightmare that endangers the lives of everyone involved, and the only way to stop it is finish the game. Alan (Robin Williams) and Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) will have to play some more if there lives are return to normality. The concept of the movie is truly original and it successfully delivers on its potential, with an excellent cast and funny script, this adventure is both hilarious and action packed, with some cool special effects thrown in. Great family entertainment 8/10 A lovely little film; This four year-old film, I would highly recommend for anyone out there in fantasy-land. Nice special effects, a very good idea behind the plot and Robin Williams all ensure a thoroughly enjoyable experience if you like action-comedies without the ubiquitous \"Good vs. Bad\" show-down. Jumanji is very different and well worth seeing. I look forward to the upcoming Jumanji 2 next year;  the cast for Jumanji 2 probably needs to include Gerard Depardieu instead of Robin Williams!!!! :-) Jumanji a great classic movie of the mid 1990's; I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was. The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done. This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too. Probably worth checking out, even today; There is a lot to like in this movie. The concept was intriguing. Robin Williams plays a basic Robin Williams character, i.e. a man-child. I never would have recognized Kirsten Dunst or Laura Bell Bradley as children without the cast list, but they both performed well. David Alan Grier did befuddlement just as well back then as he does now. Bebe Neuwirth and Bonnie Hunt did nicely, and looked very nice as well. The pace got a bit frenetic for me, though I understand that this was deliberate. The CGI animals looked fine in the distance but up close, not so much. I know we are spoiled by the unlimited effects in films today, but some of these, like the lion, looked terrible. I saw in the credits that they had Industrial Light &amp; Magic, so I doubt it could have been done any better at the time. And some of the things in the ending did not seem to totally follow from the body of the film. It's probably worth checking out though, even today. Jumanji  a timeless adventure story; There are few children's movies that I particularly enjoyed  I can recount The Borrowers, Labyrinth and The Neverending Story. Jumanji, however takes a new place among children's films  in fact, it may seem that initially, Jumanji is about simplistic story about kids playing a board game. Based on a gorgeous picture book story of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg, this movie takes a beautiful magical adventure and makes it into a thrill ride that defies all natural laws. Time travel, physical transformations, perceptual distortions and multiple universes are just a few of the things that Jumanji toys with. The most evident phenomena is that the characters run in two different and parallel universes, one where Jumanji exists, and the other where it is just a dream. The life of Judy and Peter as orphans exists in a different world from the one where Jumanji doesn't exist  in other words, Jumanji is a catalyst of fate, an evil entity that does not bring about awe as it did in Allsberg's book, but fear. The world that Allen Parrish is doomed to be incarcerated in the jungles of Jumanji is another one, but that period of time is nonexistent in the world he will eventually live in. This is the beauty of the movie; that these characters can only allow their trauma and epiphanies to cross worlds. With each roll of the dice, the characters grow and change. The ending with 'Jumanji' is mark of the end of that universe  everything that the jungle world had yielded, from the colonist-hunter Van Pelt to the roaring stampede and the monkeys had to return, to be sealed into the game and the universe. The game controls life; but it is merciful when played to the end without cheating. The mental agony and pain must have been tremendous for the Parrishes. Presumably, Alan spent his twenty six years in the jungle, but returned to his old self only to again relive his life as if it never happened. The temporal distortion must have presumably had an effect on his parents, although only Sarah seems to notice. (She was playing the game  and only those playing are directly affected, but in the game universe of Judy and Peter we see a problem in the movie's understanding of temporal change) The power of fate in deciding the endgame was critical in the film. It seems that the game was in itself a game of a game; it was all planned out and ready to go. In fact, it also seems that no matter how crazy or perilous the situation is, the characters cannot be killed. Even Van Pelt says at the Sir Sav A Lot that \"I am hunting only Alan. I won't kill you, since you didn't roll\" He too is bound to the rules of the game, no matter how much of a colonialist he is. The game instills a high level of fear without death, in order for the game to continue, all the characters must be present. So in one way, no one need be scared of anything in the game. Instead, the game builds resilience in the characters. It was natural that in the end the end was initiated by the future; or more appropriately the past. At the end, both Sarah and Alan make up for the trouble they have caused and have a life bond from the experience. The jumping between 1994 and 1964 is a critical aspect where we see that the horrors of the game have allowed Judy and Peter's parents to not die in the ski accident. They are oddly willing to put an end to their vacation when they hardly know the Parrishes \"In the jungle, you must wait, until you roll a five or eight\"  Jumanji \"Roll a two, roll a four, but never ask for more\"  Gautam RATING: 10/10 (amazing) An entertaining, chaotic adventure, one which impressed me as a kid and still does now; I first heard of this successful family adventure movie at school in the late primary grades. It must have been new to the VHS format at the time (meaning I missed its successful theatrical run), and a student in my class brought a copy in for show and tell. I think I was interested in seeing it for months before I finally did. I remember watching it more than once on video in the summer of 1996. After those months of anticipation, I don't think I was let down, even if it did seem weird and scary the first time, with all the chaos. I guess I wasn't used to seeing that in films at the time. I've watched it again twice in recent years, after growing up, and both times, I found that it was still entertaining, unlike some movies I enjoyed in my childhood. In 1969, Alan Parrish is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Brantford, New Hampshire, with an upper class family. One day, after being ambushed by a group of bullies, he hears a mysterious sound of drums coming from a construction site! At the site, he digs up a box, where the sound is coming from, a box which was buried there 100 years earlier! Inside, he finds a board game called Jumanji, and takes it home. When Alan is at home by himself after a falling out with his father, his friend, Sarah Whittle, comes over, and he shows her the game. They begin to play it, not realizing how powerful and dangerous it is! Alan is sucked inside, and Sarah is chased off by bats that come out of the game! 26 years later, two kids, Judy and Peter Shepherd, whose parents have died, move into the old Parrish house with their aunt Nora. The siblings hear the drumming of Jumanji from up in the attic, and find the game. They start playing the game without a clue, just like Alan and Sarah did, and dangerous animals begin to come out of it! Also, Alan is finally released after being trapped in the jungle for 26 years! He learns that the year is 1995, and sadly, his parents have passed away. He must now continue the game with Judy and Peter, and reunite with Sarah. The four of them are all players now, and they must finish the game if things are ever going to go back to normal, which will obviously be very risky! The film starts well with the spooky 1869 sequence, when the box is buried out in the dark. After that, it's usually pretty good around the beginning. During the first of my two latest viewings, I remember finding most of the movie dull before Robin Williams comes in, but with my last viewing, I didn't find that to be the case. There isn't much humour during this part of this film, but there is some suspense. When Williams does make his boisterous entry, that's when the humour starts. After that, there's both excitement, with all the action and chaos, and humour. Williams provides laughs with his antics, but the film doesn't rely entirely on him for the humour. Sarah's reluctance to continue the game in 1995, the scene with Van Pelt, the trigger happy hunter from the game in a gun shop, and Aunt Nora and Officer Carl Bentley witnessing some of the Jumanji animals are also funny. Other merits of \"Jumanji\" include some poignant moments, good CGI effects (even if they're not the best, and have been topped since then), and decent acting, which includes decent child actors, unlike some films. All these things are what I think makes this film good family entertainment. HORRIBLE!; This was on TV again recently, and naturally the kids stopped to watch it. Why I will never know. We own a copy and they rarely if ever put it in the VCR. Whose idea was this movie? Joe Johnston, the guy responsible for some of the worst movies of the 1990s and whose only really decent film was HONEY, which was way back when? I have said previously this is really a horror movie in disguise and obviously not a particularly good one. What in hell is with the special effects? Is there a worse-looking set of animals in film history? I wonder all these years later if maybe the distorted, cartoonish look of the monkeys and lion were intentional, since they sprang from a children's board game. But then why do the elephants, rhinos, pelican and even the oversized mosquito, look relatively normal? Robin Williams is about as bad as he ever got, except for the nightmarishly bad JACK (although I never saw his ripoff of Benigni, which I can just imagine to what depths he plummets, and I forgive him WHAT DREAMS MAY COME since he obviously did not write or direct that fiasco). View JUMANJI at your own mental peril! Dangerous Boarding Game; In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called \"Jumanji\" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan's father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. \"Jumanji\" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90's. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Jumanji\" In the Jungle You Must Wait, Until the Dices Add 5 or 8; This film is about two children playing a mysterious board game that was left by the previous owner of the house they're living in now. They play it and the game begins. A man comes out from the game after staying there for a decade. They figure out the game is dangerous and think it would all go away if they just finish it. During the coarse of the game, there is peril everywhere! This is a good movie, not better than Zathura, but it's still good. I have to warn some parents out there because if you're taking your kids to see this movie, it might scare them. Might. Although it didn't scare me because I'm 14. Characters get hurt. Some even die. There are funny moments and sweet moments. This is a good film that anyone could enjoy. Probably not your little children. Quite a Lot of Rapid Movement; I worked for several years at a bookstore. I remember when the children's book \"Jumanji\" came in. The book jacket with the reckless monkeys was very catchy. It was a very short book, so I have a feeling that some liberties were taken with the plot. There had to be a ton of extrapolation. This is a rapid fire movie which at times takes a bit of industry to keep up with. There are rules to the game and for me, they are very hard to follow. There is also a time element that is in play here. Robin Williams, as usual, plays his character to the hilt. The kids are pretty good as well. I'm sure this would appeal to a younger audience. There is no time for attention spans to expire. The computer generated graphics are wonderful, to be sure. Those monkeys are really the stars of the show. Unique; I am trying to find my words in order to perfectly describe Robin, but i just realized that it's impossible to do it. Words are not enough to describe such a man... I've seen a lot of people in my life, all kind of people, but i never saw someone having so much warmth and kindness in just a small smile like Robin. That's something which makes you to love him unconditionally. The way he acted in the movies was so original that it can not be compared with anyone else in the history of cinema. He's smile made us all better people a little bit, which means he changed the world in he's own way. He will be always with us, and within us. Let's make him immortal !!! Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a 10/10. No No No -- its a 10; This is one of those films which sort of faded into obscurity at time of release but will I believe over time be considered a classic. I have seen it over a dozen times. And, for the purposes of this review, the reason I mention that fact is to ask the obvious question... why? And the why is because of the narrative. It is nearly perfect. Heck, it may even be perfect. If you are going to create a hi-CGI fantasy about children, geared to the child within (so to speak) you need to jump down the rabbit-hole is a convincing way, so that there is no hope of return. This is the essence of every good \"fantasy\" from the beginning of time, from Peter Pan to Alice In the Looking Glass to the Matrix. Once you are in, it is hard to get out. And that hooks the audience. What better way to establish such a narrative than a kid's game with \"turns\" and \"dice\"? Where each roll gets you in deeper? Also a great chance to watch to watch Robin Williams and Dunst before he/she became too old to play these roles; and Bonnie Hunt (great!) before her film career imploded. Postscript 12/14 -- with the recent passing of Robin Williams I wanted to add the following, especially after another viewing. First, it is one of the most perfect fantasies Hollywood has done since the invention of color film (keeping in mind that the best fantasies hail from the 30s and 40s). Second, and I know his fans will not agree, possibly Williams' best work. Early in his career, and he got a chance to play a boy in a man's body. Is there a more perfect role for him?? Hunt did not have what you would call a wide or varied film career but she is pitch perfect here, and matches Williams note for note, emotion for emotion. And Kirsten Dunst, another controversial figure, seems to have had a backwards career, with her impact dwindling as she aged. The highlight of her career may have been kissing Spiderman, but her face holds the camera here in every scene she is in, and she too is pitch perfect. Massively un-appreciated, one of the greatest films in its genre ever, right up there with Harry Potter or Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast. This Ain't No Game!; CONTAINS SPOILERS In 1869, two boys bury something unknown but whatever it is, it's very dangerous. It stays for 100 years. In 1969, young Alan Parrish rides his bike one lovely day, unfortunately he's soon chased by Billy Jessup and his gang. Alan goes to his father, Samuel's shoe factory. Alan tells his father what's up, but his father merely tells him that he must stand and face something you're afraid of, so Alan did and got the crap kicked out of him. Suddenly, he heard drums beating. It was in a construction site. He dug up a wooden board game called Jumanji. At home, Alan's parents have announced that they shall send him to Cliffside School for Boys. Alan refuses to go. Samuel get's mad and storms out of the house with his wife. Alan's friend, Sarah Widdle, comes over that night and the two decide to play the game Alan found. It resulted in Alan being sucked into the game until someone would roll a 5 or 8. 26 years later-1995. A woman named Nora, her niece Judy and nephew Peter buy the old Parrish house. One aternoon, while Aunt Nora left for the office and the kids were about to leave for school when they hear drums beating. The game was calling. They dig it out of the attic and decide to play it. Out of the game comes monkeys, mosquitos and a lion! Also, Alan comes out. He's very grateful, then goes to the old shoe factory to find his parents. He learns of their passing; by finishing the game, they can put an end to the wild animal attacks, so the three go off to find Sarah Widdle, because according to the game, it was her turn. At first she was reluctant to play, but she did. They encounter a huge pod plant and a hunter, Van Pelt who wants to kill Alan for some reason. Well, after braving a stampede, a huge rain fall, giant spiders and an earthquake, the game was over and all went back to 1969 where Alan patched things up with his father, he and Sarah get rid of the game and live happily ever after in the bright and cheerful 1995, rather than the dark one Jumanji had created. Pretty good movie! Nice special effects. Robin Williams was good, as always. Bonnie Hunt was good. The kids were too. Kirsten Dunst grew up to play Spiderman's love interest. Also, the same actor that plaus Samuel Parrish (Jonathan Hyde of Richie Rich) also plays Van Pelt. I hear there's going to be a sequel: Jumanji 2. But it doesn't have Robin Williams. For the life of me, I can't figure out what it will be like. But for now, you gotta see the first one! -- It's time to play the game. You can't move until somebody roll 5 or 8.; Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. \"Jumanji\" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game. The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078; Despite the fact that I am a huge Robin Williams fan, I had never seen Jumanji, it just never appealed to me, but even since Williams' untimely passing, I've been trying to view his entire filmography. I also wanted to catch the original film, before its reputation was irreparably damaged by next years re-make, featuring the Rock, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart. The film focuses on young Alan Parrish (Robin Williams), the son of a rich industrialist, who is always in the way. One day, he finds a weird board game, buried in a construction site, and decides to play with a friend, but this is no ordinary game, and Alan becomes trapped inside for decades. It isn't until two kids, moving into a new house discover the game and start to play it, that Alan is freed. Not wanting these kids, to face the same fate he did, they track down his old friend, and decide to finish the game and put the madness to an end. I think when Robin Williams played a child or a crazy person he was at his best. Those were the time when he could really just let go, be free, and be truly hilarious. As in most films like this, Williams is the film, the rest of the cast revolves around him, and without him, this is just another kids movie. Kids love these quirky, weird films, and parents hate being dragged to them, but Williams had a way of making both sides happy and making them both want to see it, that's what Jumanji was. For all intense and purposes this is a kids movie, with Williams acting like a big kid, but making adult jokes, innuendoes, and just being that guy who made him a legend. Almost Thoroughly Enjoyable; If I had been 10 or 12 when this movie came out it would probably be my favorite.  As I was 34, my first reaction was that there was too much screaming. But there's much here for an imaginative youngster (or oldster) to enjoy.  The script is generally witty, and except for the screaming, parents will not be bored watching it -- and if they squint their minds eyes enough to remember what they enjoyed before puberty, they'll get a nostalgic rush. This is everything family entertainment should be.  And though it does involve the supernatural, it is presented in a negative light and none of the characters relish being part of it. I guess that life is a game of chance!; You know the drill: young Alan Parrish gets sucked into a board game called Jumanji, returns when a brother and sister are playing 26 years later, and has to battle the animals that wreak havoc on the town. It all seems pretty simple, but they play some neat tricks with it in the movie. As the adult Alan, Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but still makes the character admirable. With good support from Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and Patricia Clarkson, this is a pretty interesting movie. I will admit that the monkeys looked pretty fake, but we can't dwell on that in this movie; the point is to enjoy oneself while watching it. Oh and one more thing: from \"Jumanji\", I learned the difference between alligators and crocodiles. If I could go back...; I love this movie. I don't know why. Maybe because I wonder what it would be like to start my life over again when I was 10 or 12, knowing what I know now at...well, much older. My favorite part is at the end, when Alan and Sarah come face to face in 1995 with the 2 kids who played the game with them the PREVIOUS 1995. Visually very interesting and not a rip off of any other film, that's for sure! Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Exciting Family Adventure; In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called \"Jumanji\", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished. Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human. The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like \"Dead Poet's Society\" or \"Good Morning, Vietnam\"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality. This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor. Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the \"Narnia\" stories). Fortunately, any moralising in \"Jumanji\" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of \"alternative timelines\". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10 Meaningful themes for all ages; This film is NOT a 'kids' film and it is NOT just another example of Hollywood making money off of an already existing product. Let me tell you what it is. It's a film that examines such pertinent themes as frustrated adolescence, negligent adults and wishes that do and don't come true. The cast is superb. The script provides them with enough action so that they can just do what they do best (ie comedy) without being 'preachy' with the messages that the writer was trying to convey. I was anxiously awaiting the sequel because I figured that, as movie technology advances, some of the flatness of the special effects would be fixed. Oh well. David Alan Grier was especially funny. He is one of Hollywood's best kept secrets. He belongs in movies not just T.V.. Decent family entertainment; On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children. Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it. Lame, lamer, lamest.; I guess this must be meant to appeal to kids, because has that R.L. Stein flavor to it -- you can't suspend disbelief because the whole thing is just so cheesy and lame. The closet thing to an interesting character is Carl the cop -- although Sara seeing a shrink after watching Alan vanish IS a hoot. Fine for the kids, but adults would do better with a book and a hot bath. Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... The jungle; This is an excellent movie for all ages. Congratulations to the cast, production, stunts and all the people. And now I want know what's happen in the jungle when Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) was there for 26 years. This should be a good adventure. This game is like no other.; Roll doubles and look out.  Elaborate special effects highlight this tale about two kids who release an imprisoned player trapped for decades in a supernatural board game. Story line is quite stupid, but this is so much fun to watch. Robin Williams does his thing. A young Kirsten Dunst is charming in this preview of her future talents. Rounding out this mish-mash of a cast are: Bebe Neuwirth, David Alan Grier, Bradley Pierce, Bonnie Hunt and Jonathan Hyde in a dual role. Special effects and sight gags are redeeming. The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for 25(?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\" Probably not perfect, but very fun; Jumanji is a highly imaginative and very fun movie. The visuals are good, and the story is creative and exciting. The storyline consists of a man being sucked into a board game. 26 years later, two kids find the board game and set him free. However, the game board has already released a few dangers, and those dangers must be stopped. The only way to do that is to finish the board game, and the animals (or whatever else was released from the game) will be put back into the game. There is action and minor thrills, and the movie emerges as being a fun experience. It's kind of creative, and it's an excellent adventure film. Sure, it is a bit cliché'd and the monkeys look pretty corny, but don't let them distract you from the overall enjoyment of the movie. 6.5/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment. original, not like any other game; I saw this when I was 9, and I was obsessed with it and saw it 3 times in the theater, and it was my favorite movie. The whole idea of slight, unhappy, 12-year-old Alan Parrsih (Adam Hann-Byrd-Little man Tate, Halloween H:20) getting trapped in a board game in 1969, for 26-years and coming back as a grown man. The idea was unforgettable to my interest in time, and I imagined my self then coming back 35-years old. The movie is so elaborate and original, the stampede was always my favorite, it's got such edge-of-year seat action with the Rhinos, Elephants, and Zebras crashing throught the wall at the last second, and they used the most dangerous animals possible. Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) ALan's childhood friend, and Peter (Bradley Pierce) and Judy (Kirsten Dunst, along with Alan play the game and bring Gian mosquitos, vines and a Hunter from the game. The movies also really funny especially the cop. Geeky Randy's summary; Fun family film about a magical board game that hosts many dangers that can only be stopped when a player finishes. The entire cast does their job well, but the only one not interchangeable is Hyde in a double-role as the main character's wealthy stern father and a big-game hunter (hint: intentional parallel). Entertaining from start to finish, but even children in 1995 were likely very aware that the scary creatures on screen were nothing more than special-effectsbecause of this, it's difficult to ever get lost in the delicious chaos despite all the funny moments and thrills. Still, despite its flaws, the story is interesting enough for the whole family enjoy and the film is good enough to be replayed every few years. *** (out of four) A game for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind; A fun family film about a game. I was sceptical, but as I like Robin Williams, I was obliged to go and see the film. The first thing that hit was the atmosphere. It's a bizarre and quite scary film. Well for a 7 year old anyway. Robin Williams plays the part really well but the real star of the film is the special effects. The stampede and various other disasters from the game were fantastic for their day. OK they look a bit dated now but in their time, they were some of the most advanced special effects ever used in movies. Bonnie Hunt steals the show with her humour and character. And the 2 children are fantastic as actors. The only thing that lets Jumanji down is the tag line. It gives away too much of the story of the film. But don't let that spoil things. The film is an unmissable adventure based on a small picture book. Surprised? You will be. IT's the most great movie EVER, you can't get Enough of it; I want to give this movie what it really deserve ,If i will say there is movie that i will never forget in my life ,it will be this great movie for the brilliant actor robin Williams. first of all, I want to thanks all the cast of this movie and the great director ,for bringing it to us. when I want to be refresh and happy and laugh I will watch it when I want to feel the power of love and the thriller of adventure, I will watch it , there are a lot of people how see it as for children only but its really not , it was like they know where to start and finish. this movie is for everyone its my best movie ever I give it 10%10 don't miss it Not board; Watched this on TV where it was aired as a tribute to the late Robin Williams. It's an enjoyable family-entertainment fantasy adventure with Williams playing a grown man who as a boy was sucked into a mysterious, dark board game called Jumanji, freed years later by a couple of young children who happen upon the game when they move into Williams's character by this time run-down house. Along with Williams also fully-grown girl friend of the time Kirsten Dunst, the four of them brave everything the game throws at them to finish it and free Williams to return to his old life. And does the game throw everything at them! Crazy monkeys, a roaring lion, a jungle which comes to life, hordes of stampeding elephants zebras and rhinos and one very persistent big game hunter. A veritable special effects fest, while the plot amounts to no more than awaiting the outcome of the next roll of the dice on the board, it all makes for good clean exciting fun and who amongst us as never enjoyed playing a board game as a child. The back stories about Williams being bullied as a child, having a fractious relationship with his dad and his adult wooing of Dunst are lightly drawn but all of course resolved happily ever after by the end. Williams is fine after he makes his delayed first appearance, portraying yet again a child trapped in a man's body just as he did in a line going back through Peter Pan in \"Hook\", \"Popeye\" all the way to his breakout part in \"Mork and Mindy\". Dunst offers good support and the kids aren't too gauche and sentimental either. Nice to see \"Cheers\" Bebe Neuwirth get a decent part too. I wouldn't call it Robin Williams defining role but as an update on the old children's matinée features, this was an entertaining feature made the better by Williams engaging performance. R.I.P. to him. When two kids from the 60's stumble upon a game, one of them is sucked into its jungle.  Now it's up to two present day kids to finish it.; ********/10 This movie deserves more than it received because it is not only a very different plot but has excellent character development, which is key to a great movie. The special effects are so-so (due to the time period in which it was made), but it is overall exciting while humorous. There isn't a movie quite like this one, and is one of my favorites. Robbin Williams is tremendous and while watching it you forget his true identity. Kerstien Dunst is young, but is impressive for her age, commonly not found in some movies. I guess if I'd have to sum this movie up in one word it'd be \"unique\". Not many films have monsoons indoors or mansions turned into jungles. The Disney movie that could have been; Hunt and Williams play the parts of shellshocked-delayed stress syndrome surviviors quite well. The story is entertaining and engrossing, with both elements of light and darkness. The effects-well, they DO look a bit unreal-and perhaps that is for the best-it adds a sense of unreality to the story -after all, these things come from a board-game universe! Even Van Pelt looks a bit CGI...and Bebe Nuewerth is a sweetie. Not for 13+ age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for 1980 not for 1995. Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. Watts meets New England; Disaster visits a New England town: When all hell breaks loose, when beasts from nowhere trample the streets and earthquakes rip the blocks and giant mosquitoes and God-knows-what-next befall the descendants of pilgrims and fishermen, of Minutemen and revolutionaries and of immigrants yearning to breath free, those same hard-scrabble, salt-of-the-earth, no-nonsense patriots all join hands, pull together, and-- . . . loot their neighbors' downtown storefronts! Unbelievable.  Tinseltown belts out a fairly well-done and imaginative fantasy (which truly `Jumanji' is), and then--wouldn't you know it?--foul it with one of the many flies stuck in the ointment that is Hollywood, a scene so diagnostic of the intellectual sickness that has infested the industry since Hellman sang her praises to Stalin.  Then again, maybe it is believable. `Jumanji's' only other flaws: a part too small for the underrated Bebe Neuwirth (a joy to watch always and here no less so), kids full of bravery that's a little too scripted and moments of suspense that really aren't. If we can ignore all that, even the brief bit of class-warfare propaganda, then \"Jumanji' becomes eminently watchable, even memorable. But promise us you won't loot any stores next time you see monkeys charging down the street. Grade A Effects; This movie is the kind of movie you wouldn't want to watch when you're trying to get to sleep. This movie is lurking with action and adventure around every corner, along with some animals. Great effects, good plot, and interesting characters. A *** out of ****. Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. Good, classic, family fun; Despite being rejected by many a film critic for being childish and lacking in the classic sweepstakes, I found this film more than enough to satisfy my evening desires. With its strong plot and good actors, this film has much going for it, despite slightly lame CGI, its the story that carries you on. I have heard few people praise this film but I believe it to be a classic due to having an eerie dark sense all the way through until the credits roll, whilst still maintaining comedy and being for the whole family. It is bound to keep the viewer thinking of the awful situation these people face long after viewing has finished. Overall, one of the high points of Williams' career, and Kursten Dunst has never been better. Try it, you might surprise yourself.  Excellent!; There is only one way to describe Jumanji: excellent. The plot is very, original, with outstanding concepts packed into each individual scene. After viewing this movie, the wild side of the jungle gets into you, making you want to dare to play the game. Although the computer animation may not look all that real, I still give this movie a 10/10, for an outstanding plot, casting, and spirit, which any great movie has. Almost 20 years on and it's still entertaining kids of all ages; Jumanji was on TV today, and my 8 year old son had liked him in \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and I remembered it being fun, so with sweets and crisps we sat down to watch it. Orphans Judy (A young Kristen Dunst, who had started in \"An Interview With A Vampire\" the previous year, but still a few years away from Spiderman fame) and Peter move in to a mansion with their Aunt (Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers) where the find a board game called Jumanji. When they start playing, they free Alan Parish (Robin Williams) who was trapped in the game when he was a child. Robin Williams is always fun to watch and he was very popular at the time, due to movies like \"Aladdin\" and \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and Kristen Dunst was a real talent as a young actress, none of the annoying traits of usual child actors. Of the supporting cast David Alan Grier is fun as a hapless Police Officer, as is Jonathan Hyde in duel roles as a hunter and young Alan's Dad. Defo worth checking out if you have kids, and more than enjoyable even if you don't. Some of the special effects have dated badly, but are still OK, most of the humour is spot on too. My son got a big kick out if it and really enjoyed it. And I thought for a 19 year old special effects laden kids movie it had held up pretty well. I love this film!; I loved this movie! First of all, my #1 favorite actress is Kirsten Dunst, who plays Judy! I have seen Kirsten in countless other films including: Bring It On, Disney's Anastasia, Mona Lisa Smile, Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2 (June 30), and (Duh!) Jumanji of course. We have a lot in common. I am a HUGE fan of Robin Williams as well. He has played in films that I've seen such as: Mrs. Doubtfire, (also starring Pierce Brosnan who plays the worlds greatest Secret Agent: Bond, James, Bond. Robin has also been in: Disney's Aladdin (The Genie), Patch Adams, Flubber, Biscentanial Man, and Hook. I have seen Bonnie Hunt in her t.v. show, Life With Bonnie, and Cheaper By The Dozen starring the ever sooooo funny comedian Steve Martin and my sister's favorite actress Hilary Duff. I have a lot of favorite actor's but only one actress, and that's Kirsten! When I first saw her in Jumanji I fell in love with her. She is one beautiful young lady. I didn't know who she was though, LOL!!! I didn't recognize her in Spider-Man \"sigh\". As I looked at the credit's I saw a name: Kirsten Dunst. I remember seeing that name in the end credit's for Jumanji. I just about fainted, LOL!!!! I rented Jumanji again, and I looked at her and I realized: \"Wow, she hasn't changed a bit!\" \"She's still got those big Blue eye's that I just love,\" she hasn't lost her sense of humor,\" and I will always, always, ALWAY'S LOVE HER SMILE! Every movie I've seen her in, she's always been a really hot Redhead, Well, in Jumanji she wasn't a redhead, but, SHE WAS STILL HOT! LOL!!!! She's a legend, to me. I looked at her biography on IMDb.com and I saw that she was born on April 30,1982! I just about fell out of my chair. LOL!!! I was born April 10,1988!!!!!! She's six years older than me, but heck! I still love her. But, I'll always remember her as that little girl named Judy in Jumanji! My favorite line that she said was when the Cop commented on Robin's clothes for the first time: \"He's a Vegetarian! I was sucking in air, I was laughing so hard. Another scene was in the rain in Jumanji when Robin and Bonnie were about to kiss, and Kirsten is in the back rolling her eyes! LOL!!! That brought be back to the upside down kiss in the rain in Spider-Man! Jumanji is a fun movie! It can be a little intense sometimes, but it can also be funny. One last thing: KIRSTEN DUNST IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE MY FAVORITE ACTRESS! THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE! Til the dice read five or eight ",
       " Jumanji; Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in 1995, I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 1800's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in 1969, transporting him into the jungle world for 26 years until two new children stumble upon its drumming. Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time ",
       " well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects. The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be \"real\", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end. The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still childrenone had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow upand with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think. There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as \"Soulman\" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the \"adult\" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal. A great movie; JUMANJI I loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today! The movie is about a boy who finds a board game called Jumanji. When he takes it home and starts to play it with a friend, he soon realises that this is no ordinary game. He gets sucked into the game and is not released again until 26 years later 2 more kids find the game and release him. Now he is grown up and has to find a way to end this game before everything it releases destroys the town. Due to the sad passing of the genius that was Robin Williams, the TV channels have decided to show all of his movies. Jumanji was the first one I saw. The story to this film is like not her that I had seen before. It was an original idea (unless there is another film I don't know about) that was just so imaginative. It works really well and has a great adventure element about it. The effects are average. This was made in the mid 90s so that probably has something to do with it. The animals were obviously not real. You could see the lion was so mechanical it made me laugh. And the other animals were so obviously computer generated. But it was comical and that just added to the fun of the film. The acting was great. The main character was played by Robin Williams. He was as energetic and full of character in this role, just like he brought to every role he took. Other cast members were Jonathan Hyde, a young Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bonnie Hunt. Bonnie Hunt was brilliant. Her reaction and facial expressions made me laugh a few times in this. Another stand out performance was by David Alan Grier. David was so funny as the cop. His comedy timing was excellent and deserves a mention. This film really does keep you entertained throughout and is just a lot of fun to watch... Even now nearly 20 years later. I will give this 7 out of 10. Normally I end my reviews with a quote from the movie, but this time I just want to say how gutted I am about the news of Robins death. I am a fan of his work. I watched Mork and Mindy when I was a kid and grew up watching Jumanji, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam, Jack etc... There were so many great films that he made. I always saw Robin as so full of energy and full of life. He had one of the greatest smiles in Hollywood and when i saw an interview with him, he seemed so chirpy and happy. It just shows that in front of the camera, you never know what is going on in people's heads. I was sad to hear he had been suffering from depression. Depression is such a deadly illness. I know this sounds stupid, but I am gutted that I was not there to talk to him, help him. I hate to think that he felt so alone, especially as he had millions of fans all over the world that knew him on screen. He made the world laugh out loud so many times. Even through bad times in my life, watching his movies has put a smile on my face. Robin deserved much more happiness than he got. He gave so much to me and the rest of the world and it doesn't seem right that he should end his life this way. I will miss seeing new movies from him, but will always continue to go back to enjoy his old ones. Robin will live on in my house and he will always continue to make me smile. R.I.P. Robin Williams. A 90s classic.; Jumanji has some decent acting from the adults and from the kids. Apparently this film is set in New Hampshire - the scenery is not all that, maybe because New Hampshire itself is not all that, but regardless this is a fun fast-paced adventure flick that is never boring. An error in this film is that this board game is depicted as some sort of master of the universe, the majority of the film is set in 1995 - When Alan is out of the game and everything else from the game gets sucked back in the film goes back to 1969 where Alan and Sarah are kids again, fast forward to the 90s and they meet Judy, Peter and their parents, i guess the movie wanted to make it an extremely happy ending where the parents get a second chance, but then at the same time Judy and Peter never remember Alan and Sarah, this is the definition of a fantasy movie, if you think about the logic of it too much it'll drive you crazy. Bottom line if this error never happened there'd be no movie, this is what a fantasy movie is - a motion picture that is completely out there and difficult to wrap your head around. A lot of the scenes are still embarrassingly funny - a few examples - when the monkeys shoot the roof of the car and drive off, some of the behavior and dialogue from the police officer Carl Bentley, when Alan and Sarah get stuck in the floor, and the result of Bentley's literal wreck of a car is embarrassingly cringe-worthy in itself. Jumanji actually has a realistic element which is the behavior of Alan's father, he doesn't seem to care that much about Alan, is self- absorbed expecting Alan to follow his footsteps with boarding school, and is generally quite strict and cold and just like Alan said during one scene - his father could barely even hug him. After Alan went missing the father got depressed, stopped going to work and that was the end of it, he only seemed to care about Alan when Alan wasn't there, what's the point of that?! it's like emotional displacement or something, it was all a little too late, but as we see at the end Alan's parents are still alive and it's clear that they have time to change their standoffish relationship. This is the definition of a children's movie - everything has to be happy with no tragedies at the end. Jumanji is very dramatic but brilliant especially the \"Iv'e seen things you've only seen in your nightmares\" scene and the \"26 years ago you played a game with a little boy down the street\" scene - those two pieces of dialogue were done fantastically by Robin Williams and his facial expression and body language worked perfectly with the dialogue. This motion picture also shows the viewers how children think, the scene where Alan mentions that he \"remembers the front porch being a lot bigger\" tells us that kids see everything bigger than they actually are. The funky new-age woman \"Sarah\" - the adult version is also a likable character even though she sometimes talks crap with her star- sign/zodiac-sign garbage. There is no chemistry between her and Alan though, but they can get away with it because that is not what this film is about. The special effects are what they are, they're not as bad as to ruin the movie. The actor who plays Alan's dad also plays the human hunter, why they used the same actor i don't know, but regardless he did a good job in both roles. Jumanji is set in a small town and if you are starting to dislike small town settings as i am then you can choose not to focus on the town and focus more on the main plot. Thankfully this flick only has literally a few main characters and it does a great job of making sure the plot outweighs anything else. Ja Rule Jumanji; 'Jumanji' is a drama comedy about a boy who is always picked on by a bunch of bullies. He gets sucked into a disastrous game board called 'Jumanji'. He was taken to a jungle for 26 long years. He then comes back after the dice read 8 and with the 3 other players who unleash the unexpected dangers of the jungle",
       " onto the real world. Alan Parish is a troubled boy with kids picking on him 24/7. One day while walking through a construction site he finds a chest that holds 'Jumanji' - the board inside it. He starts playing this game with a young girl, Sarah, where he is sucked into the game. After 26 yrs he comes back as a man!! Sarah Whittle is one of the bully's girlfriends and she brought back Alan's bike when he invited her in to play the game. She was really scared when Alan was sucked into the game, after that she was chased by bats all the way down the street. It looks so real but when she falls over and a bat is on her shoulder, it looks Judy and Peter are the two other players who live with their generous aunt because their parents had died in a car crash. Judy lies because it makes her feel better and Peter doesn't talk to any one except Judy. Peter turns into a half monkey/human for cheating, which special effects make this look real. Together all four encounter many different but dangerous stuff from the jungle. Not only does it affect Alan, Sarah, Judy and Peter, it affects the whole town. All in all 'Jumanji' is a rollicking imaginative adventure that will carry you away",
       " literally!! My Childhood; This movie made my childhood. I love Robin Williams movies, Jumanji introduced him to me. Jumanji is a movie that everyone should watch. Robin Williams will again make you appreciate living as he always does in his movies. The movie contains full of fantasy objects. The writer has a really great imagination. I will make my children to watch this movie after all years that pass. While watching this movie as a kid, I was scared, excited and happy. It makes you to feel every kind of feeling. This indicates that the movie has done a good job. I again recommend to everyone. Jumanji appeals for all ages. I am pretty sure I will watch the movie again when I get old with the same emotions when I watched it in the first time. Jumanji Review; Jumanji is a film directed by Joe Johnston based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg. Now I wasn't quite excited to see the films considering the reviews. But I did enjoy Zathura, the spiritual sequel to this film so I deiced to give it a go. And to my surprise I was quite entertained by the film. Plot: Judy and Peter play a board game to some disastrous results. Story and direction: The film opens up with 2 children from 1869 burying something and saying that whoever opens this up may God be with them. I mean this scene was basically not necessary. The film could have opened from 1969 with our protagonist Alan Parrish. We see Alan's world where he is bullied a lot and hides in his father's shoe factory. There we are introduced to Carl who I think was not necessary for the film in the first place. Then we see Alan taking the Jumanji game to his home and opening it. in the meanwhile, we see Alan's parents deciding to send him to boarding school to which he objects and decides never to talk to them again. Then Alan and Sarah begin to play the game when Alan gets sucked into it and Sarah getting scared runs for her life. Then the film takes a 26 year leap, where we are introduced to 2 new characters Peter and Judy, who have been given a quite nice back story. They open up the game and while they playing Alan comes out of it. Then we are taken on a joyride where the try to finish the game with a now grown Sarah. Now the thing that felt awful in the film was the CGI. It felt like you were watching some big patches of imagery that were just pasted onto the screen. Then I guess the Van Pelt character. He was just too laughable for me. And was wasted a lot. And finally, the revised 1995 version wherein some things were not explained rightly, according to me. Performances: Robin Williams made me remember that why I will be remembering him as a great actor. His comic timing was spot on. RIP Sir Williams. Bonnie Hunt was also great as Sarah. Kirsten Dunst was a great child artist in the film. So as Bradley Pierce. Favirite Scene: The scene where Alan pops up to save Peter and Judy from a lion and his joy that he has returned home after 26 years of being trapped in the game. Robin Williams just acted so great in this scene. Verdict: Although with some misses, Jumanji is a very much watchable film. I enjoyed my time with this movie. I am going with a 7.5/10 Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is 1969, and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats. 26 years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good! QFC - Jumanji; Jumanji is a fun filled film with great special effects, gripping action and it revolves around an interesting although absurd idea of a damned board game. However absurd this idea may be, it works as far as the adventure goes. It has many flaws because eventually the absurdity becomes too much and, especially for adults, it will become annoying because of its repetition in the the attempt of filling the movie with 'funnys'. Robin Williams himself is a pleasant surprise as the action hero. His choice may have been a little surprising, but alas, Williams shows he is able to be anything, anytime, anywhere. So hats off to his performance, not the deepest ever but an enjoyable turn for him. Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. My first childhood film and one of my all time favorites!; I was born in 1994 so I am one year older than but my Uncle bought a copy of Jumanji when I was in pre-school and the whole family watched it together. And after seeing the film for the first time, the story is just like a funny adventure to me and I really love it. I always sneak up to the CD cabinet to watch it again because my grandmother always gone mad every time I switch the CD player and the television. And after a several replays, the movie grown deeper to me; the message of the film and everything. Until now, I still watch the movie and still having lots of laugh. Early CGI Makes the Monkeys Look Fake! Otherwise It's Amazing!; An enchanted board game breaks into the real world and the only way out of it is to finish the game! The monkeys look \"washed-out\" and so do some of the wild zoo animals; which is why most of the rest of the EFX are mechanical or use backdrops and mattes. Otherwise a very strong 10 would be my vote, as the casting works and the plot shows lots of imagination and flair. With a \"sly wink\" to \"Peter Pan\", Alan's father plays both his dad and Van Pelt the Hunter. My two favorite scenes are when the house gets folded in half and eaten by the monstrous plant, and when everything swirls backwards into the gameboard. I also love it when the house goes \"wild\" and turns into a swamp complete with nasty alligators. I do not like the scene where the little boy turns into a monkey with a tail. Young children may find it disturbing like the donkey transformation in \"Pinocchio\". \"Jumanji\" is suspenseful and scary but no one actually dies in the film. Therefore, it's much more enjoyable when viewed again. The only one who seemed to hate it was Roger Ebert, but it's only too scary for pre-schoolers. Most \"users\" love it! What \"scares\" me the most in this film: the bats, insects, spiders, alligators, and The Hunter. The sequel will not have the charisma of the late and great Robin Williams. I still miss him. He was a comic genius. If there was a market for it, I would like it to be re-imagined with better graphics like the old \"Star Trek TOS\" reissue. A breathless unforgettable adventure!; I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind... This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure. Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story. Great! 10 out of 10 from me! Game Over, Man; Spoilers herein. The reason this film was made was because they could do the effects. That reason has no power now, and in fact most of them already look a bit cheezy. But there are some interesting elements: --Kirstin Dunst at her peak. --Robin Williams in his best role. Or rather for the role best suited to a manic comic. --A pretty cool house, one of the best in recent memory. --Some clever time folding. --A screenwriter's wet dream: in addition to creating a film world that sucks in viewer into an artificial reality, to have that film world contain another one. That world-within-the world is exactly as far from the normal world of the film as it is from us. Just like the film, it grabs us once we start and won't let go until the end. Clever idea. Not exploited. Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements. Jumanji: One of My Personal Favourites. Period.; I was about one years old when this came out, by three I was mesmerised by the analog and digital effects Jumanji contained. It stood aside the efforts of Jurassic Park, but more animal-based as Jurassic Park was dinosaurs. Robin Williams pulls off a strong performance as Alan Parrish. The film revolved his character playing the game and escaping the world the game brought to him. It had Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce aside Williams whom join this adventure. I believe the film took a creative angle, which more fluctuation that the book left for the imagination. Here it follows the book accurately, just with expansion amongst the book's basis. Hence allowed more adventure and opened more for the viewer digging themselves within this jungle adventure. I can go on about the film's details and how they amaze me. But I conclude Jumanji: One of My Personal Favourites. Period. wild CGI destruction gets repetitive; In 1869, two boys bury a mysterious dangerous wooden chest. In 1969 Brantford, New Hampshire, young Alan Parrish gets picked on by bullies. He finds the box in a local construction site. He opens the chest to find a board game Jumanji. His father is sending him to boarding school. He is about to run away when his best friend Sarah Whittle comes by. They play the game and Alan is pulled into the board game. Twenty six years later, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) buys the rundown mansion planning to open a bed-and-breakfast. She brings her niece Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter (Bradley Pierce) who lost their parents in a car accident. The kids find the board game in the attic and start playing it. Alan (Robin Williams) is released. They track down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) to finish the game and bring all the released apparitions to an end. Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) was a friend who worked at Alan's shoe factory and is now a cop. The game brings out big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) who looks like Alan's father Sam. The basic idea of a board game that comes alive is one with great possibilities. I wish that it is more than just a series of crazy CGI destruction. I wish that the players needed to use their brain power to solve clues. The constant escaping from one thing to the next gets a little bit repetitive. They start piling on top of one another. Williams is not quite as lovable as expected. Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier are kind of fun. There is an uncontrolled quality to this children's movie. Imaginative (spoiler); This is probably one of the most imaginative movies I have seen in a while. I mean, it has an entire back story, as we can see in the beginning, when those two kids are trying to get rid of the game. Then it goes to 1969, when Alan finds the game, he and Sarah start playing, and he gets sucked into Jumanji. Then, throughout the rest of the movie, Alan comes out of the jungle and he, Sarah, Judy, and Peter continue playing the game and unleashing all these dangerous animals (and Van Pelt) and the monsoon and killer plants into the city. And at the end, those kids in Japan find the game. Very well thought out. Certainly worth a look. pretty good, except...; Jumanji is an enjoyable, and at times exciting family adventure. Only one major flaw: the special effects. Jumanji relies on special effects for impact. Nothing wrong with that, only its so easy to tell that they are special effects. Enough fun to get you to sit through it, but they should really find another effects crew next time. 2/4 Fun!; I give this movie a ten on ten. I may be biased as I watched this movie when I was ten and whenever I watch it, it brings back fond memories of lazing around and watching movies during my summer vacations. But I am surprised that the overall rating for this movie is 6.5 (when I write this review), I expected it to be at least 7. This really is a fun movie to watch with some hilarious scenes. The monkey bike riding scene stands out it particular. The special effects looked good when I was young but now the fake animals are not very impressive. Jurassic Park was made before this movie and had much better special effects. Robin Williams does seem too old to play a 35 year old Alan Parish but he is a brilliant actor and you do not mind accepting him as Alan. Bonnie Hunt does a good job too as the paranoid Sarah Whittle. The kids do a great job too, especially Bradley Pierce; look out for the scene where he is searching for an axe. And David Grier is brilliant as the bumbling sheriff Carl Bentley. I suggest you watch this movie with your family on a weekend. Its worth it! Epitome of Moronic Hollywood Film-Making; A previous reviewer wrote: \"A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie.\" I agree in part and disagree in part with that comment. The problem is impossible to pinpoint, because there are PLENTY of \"big problems\" with this movie! \"Random hazard generator\" is the PERFECT description of the ancient board game! Random hazard after random hazard until the game ends is what is supposed to pass for \"plot\" in this movie. Did anybody count how many times the game board fell out of and back into the players' hands? That, too is supposed to pass for tension. Ultimately, the film fails because there isn't any development of the back story. What was the origin of the game? Now, that would have been an interesting question to explore! And how does the game work? All we ever see is the game's projection of \"random hazards\" OUTWARD into the reality of the players, but somehow Alan (Robin Williams) apparently was sucked INTO the game. How did that happen, and why doesn't it happen to any of the current players of the game? Actually, the guy in the pith helmet is, more or less, the human villain in this movie, but he is never more than an inexplicable, evil cartoon. Was he, too sucked into the game like Alan, or is he the sole human \"random hazard\" generated by the game? Why is he so determined, not to hunt animals, but to MURDER Alan? The film just glosses over the fact that this sub-plot is actually one of premeditated murder! The hunter guns for Alan simply because the plot demands it. But the movie makes no attempt whatever to explain the character. Never once did I sense any genuine emotional chemistry among the characters. Just a bunch of actors acting - not INTERACTING. The love story sub-plot felt obligatory, never genuine. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt never generated enough chemistry to make me care whether Alan and Sarah got together in the predictable end. All in all, this film has the germ of an interesting idea that is really wasted by focusing on mindless, non-stop \"random hazards,\" poor CGI effects, \"lots of screaming and running around\" and insufficient character development. Except for the precise nature of each \"random hazard,\" the whole film was disappointingly predictable, including the cliché of the almost-kiss in the midst of peril routine. How many zillion times has that been used? The dialog is a similarly endless stream of clichés. The issue was never HOW the game would end - but WHEN. The more interesting issues were never even glanced at. This kind of movie can only appeal to people raised on video games. It was generated by that kind of adventure-for-the-sake-of-adventure mentality, and it has that same kind of feel. LOVE THIS MOVIE!; Last night, May 2,2003  this movie was on again........no matter what other show we might be browsing at the time, we invariably start watching Jumanji,,,,,,we enjoy the hilarity and antics of all the characters,  it's done for shear  fun and entertainment, and we don't care if the special effects may be outdated,  we still consider it one of the best! So there! :-) Two  Happy Fishes  from oHIo Fine special effects, fizzled screenplay; This is another of those films where a 30-minute documentary on how they did the special effects would be a lot more interesting (not to mention a lot shorter) than the movie itself. The digital effects and animatronics are great; the screenplay doesn't work. A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie. The pasted-on homilies the screenplay comes up with _ the need for courage, commitment, real parent-child communication _ are drowned out in the hubbub, and a good cast (not to mention a big budget) is wasted. And they're planning a sequel to THIS? Have they run out of good (or even mediocre) films to do sequels to? Game You Could Only Dream About; Alan Parrish is the son of wealthy shoe maker Samuel Parrish. But the life of a rich man's son changes when young Alan comes upon a new board game, he is transported into it while playing it. Twenty or so years later two orphaned children, Judy (Kristen Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) come upon the game and play it. Next thing they now, Alan pops out of the game twenty years older along with a lion and some monkeys. It is a race to win the game with Alan (Robin Williams), Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt), Judy, and Peter while trying to outrun stampedes and Van Pelt, the man hunter. The movie has what a movie should have. The interaction of some of then animals is sometimes scary, sometimes funny, and sometimes just strange. Robin Williams is good like always and supported by Dunst, Hunt, and Jonathan Hyde (Van Pelt). It's what some mite call a child thriller. What to classify it as is though but it was good. Jumanji. Starring: Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kristen Dunst, Bradley Pierce, and Jonathan Hyde. 3 out of 5 Stars. Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Oh waw this is what Twister should be like!; Remember Twister? Well, this movie has probably got the same amount of special effects BUT is much more fun to watch. Let me explain. It has got a story to tell. Twister was only about twisters. Anyway, 'Jumanji' hasn't only got yummy fx, but also a verrrry good cast. Robin Williams ( 26 year old Alan Parrish ), Jonathan Hyde ( Sam Parrish/ Van Pelt ) and Bonnie Hunt ( Sarah Whittle in 1995 ) are the best members of the cast. From the moment the fun starts ( I mean, when they start playing the game ) it never ends. To be honest, the animals in this movie were almost real and I sometimes check my closet before I go to bed. You never know what could be in there... Here's what I think: the special effects deserve 10/10, the cast gets 9/10 so I think the movie must get 9,5/10. Now go and find 'Jumanji'! Wonderful adventure; My opinion: Do not underrate this movie that much. I didn't particularly like it - in fact I almost forgot about it for many years - but the story is simply very, very smart. The idea behind the plot is utter genius. Okay, the actual transformation did not work perfectly, but I insist that it was still a straight accomplishment that had 1. a nice cast, 2. sustainable visual effects and achievements, 3. a great story, 4. both funny and entertaining sequences, that even made you pause and think sometimes, which I regard as a major attainment of any movie. So - I'll give it a solid 7, which it deserves at least. a game not like the other ones; \"Jumanji\" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game \"jumanji\" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy. An excellent family entertainment achievement, with the keyword family, not just kids.; The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children's book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die! Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter  I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Grumpier Old Men Too Sedate *; While Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were an excellent team, they bombed in this film but good. What's so grumpy about Lemmon in this film? The prequel was much better. Ann Guilbert, as Sophia Loren's mother, is given little to do. Remember her as the grandmother to \"The Nanny?\" Sophia Loren, other than marrying Matthau, is also give nothing to do. Ditto for Ann-Margret, Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak, all of whom were so good in the original but are reduced to practically nothing here. I also resent Matthau, who shows off his part-Jewish heritage marrying in a church at the end. I found this to be offensive. Sorry, but that's the way I am-old fashioned. To all those criticize me for the last statement, how would you have felt if the Matthau-Loren nuptials had taken place in a synagogue? While I realize that this was a comedy, this still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. A non-religious setting would have been the only solution to this. Grumpy, but not funny; What, I wonder, does the legendary Billy Wilder think of this film starring Lemmon and Matthau, the great team he so memorably paired in 1966's \"The Fortune Cookie\"?  Wilder's film is a dark, cynical satire, and was the first of what is now seven films starring the pair.  Seven films, but only two of them--\"The Fortune Cookie\" and \"The Odd Couple\"--are genuinely funny efforts showcasing these actors' combined talents.  \"Grumpy Old Men\" was mildly amusing due less to the script than to the welcome return of Lemmon and Matthau who hadn't been on screen together in 12 years.  The unexpected box-office bonanza naturally inspired a sequel, but all this equally lucrative outing has in its favor is a brief monologue by Burgess Meredith who, as Lemmon's 95-year-old father, boasts of eating bacon and smoking Camels while the \"experts\" who warned against such vices are taking a \"dirt nap.\"  Not even Lemmon and Matthau can enliven the script by Mark Steven Johnson this time around.  The curmudgeonly Matthau admitted he didn't lke the script for the first film but did it to work with Lemmon, and that the only reason he did the sequel is because the first film was a hit.  No doubt, \"Grumpiest Old Men,\" the inevitable sequel, will be just as dreary. If these pictures make big bucks, why tamper with the formula?  Why hire Billy Wilder to punch up the quality when the public seems content merely to see Lemmon and Matthau rather than see them at their best? Who would have ever guessed that it's the same place?; For the most part, \"Grumpier Old Men\" is pretty silly. Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still at each other's throats when Italian immigrant Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in town and throws everything into flux. What actually struck me most about the movie was how different the town looked in this one from the original. Obviously, it was a different time of year, but maybe the different look was meant to show how everything might be changing in the town. Other than that, Ann-Margret returns as Ariel, and she's still as free-spirited and vivacious as she was in the original. Burgess Meredith - in his final role - is still the grandfather who can exercise absolute authority over the youngsters, although he now has the hots for Maria's mother (Ann Morgan Guilbert, aka Millie on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\"). Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah also reprise their roles from the original...ah, and there's that fish. All in all, a fairly interesting movie. Not any kind of masterpiece, but it showed that Lemmon and Matthau still had it. Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. after you have seen the first there is no point seeing this one; After the fun of watching Lemmon and Matthau act like kids for less than 2 hours (i.e. from the first movie) I was satisfied, but then due to the success of the first movie the producers decided to give it another twirl, this time the story had the two starting off as friends thanks to the incidents that happened in the ending of the first film, but then some really really idiotic stupid reason, they were at it again. The movie was not funny as it was like a replay of the first, same pranks, similar plot and screenplay made this movie a waste of time. After getting a mate for John, they (the producers) decided to get a mate for Max, with nothing to write home about but a lame script that just showed no finesse or true plan, just the producers hoping to bank on the success of the previous movie. The main disappointment in the movie for me was Sophia Loren; her acting was just too weak for me to understand that she is a star. Everybody else in the movie even Burgess Meredith (who had Alzheimer's disease and this was his last motion picture appearance) was impressive, at least that I can give them. The movie is directed this time by Howard Deutch, who later worked with the duo in 1998 for Odd Couple II, Deutch other movies also have not been well received like Getting Even with Dad (1994) and The Whole Ten Yards (2004), which are basically the reason why I will not bother seeing My Best Friend's Girl. The movie plot carries on 6 months after the incidents of the first, where both John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) were getting prepared for the wedding of their children. Then a new arrival in town a beautiful lady by the name of Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) came in to change things by turning the towns bait shop to a restaurant. John and Max join forces to try and run the new lady out of town, but the issues between John and Max's children marriage plan caused both to reignite their feud as both refused to believe that their child was at fault. Only the ladies are alive till today (February 2013), as both Lemmon and Matthau died like half a decade after this movie release. Grumpier Old Men was a box office success in its own part, but a huge critical disappointment, as the movie cost 10 million dollars less than its predecessor and made like a million more in the box office. After you have seen the first there is basically no point why you should bother seeing this one, because it will stand in my mind as one movie I credit as a waste of time and talent. www.lagsreviews.com forget the fussing; As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Funnier than the first!; This movie is downright hilarious with tons of good one-liners. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (may they both rest in peace) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max &amp; John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says \"Holy moly\" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor! Sophia, twenty years later at 80, is still spectacular.; I saw a picture of Sophia on her eightieth birthday, demurely covering herself with a sheet and a heart-melting smile. All I could think of was the scene where she hitched up her bra and marched through the bar, and every man looked, and I do mean every man. I read later that she had \"improved\" the script for that. A reviewer in the SF Chronicle wrote later that she said she had had no \"touch- ups\", and if so then \"her genes need investigating.\" I remember her many films where her beauty was so natural that it was a wonder any man could concentrate on his lines. She never traded on it, but on her talent as an actress. Carlo Ponti was a lucky man: beauty without guile, talent without pretense. Italian pizza were like street food. When she heard we had so many pizza parlors, she thought we must be a poor country. Then she visited, and dined on American pizza. She reconsidered, gracefully and graciously. A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances...; A sequel to the thoroughly enjoyable Grumpy Old Men, 'Grumpier Old Men' is A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances. The sequel has the spirit of its prequel &amp; the amazing cast, led by the impeccable talents of the Late/Great Jack Lemmon &amp; the Late/Great Walter Matthau, are in full form! 'Grumpier Old Men' Synopsis: John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. 'Grumpier Old Men' works well as a romantic-comedy, as it has moments of humour &amp; subtle romance. I loved the prequel &amp; I must say, the sequel doesn't fail to deliver. The film has sustained its energy &amp; wit, that one would expect from it. Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is entertaining, although initially the pace is slightly slow. Howard Deutch's Direction is top-class. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is good. Editing also is ably done. Performance-Wise: Lemmon &amp; Matthau shine all through. Its their sheer on-screen chemistry, that alone is worth watching the entire film. Sophia Loren is top-notch. Ann-Margret is impressive. Kevin Pollak &amp; Daryl Hannah leave a mark. Late/Great Burgess Meredith is memorable in his part. On the whole, 'Grumpier Old Men' is a smooth, relaxing watch. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10 Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from 1995. The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe 8yrs old, and must have seen it over 100 x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it 15 minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in 1995, 2 years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie 8 out of 10. Mini Ha Has In Minnesota; It's just possible that the intention was to shoot four Grumpy Old Men titles featuring the four seasons because after the Winter setting of the first one we are now in Summer though theoretically such a cycle should have begun with Spring and ended with Winter so maybe the cyclical thing was an afterthought. Whatever we have virtually the same cast doing virtually the same thing with one absentee and two replacements one of which, Anna Guilbert is actually a native of Minneapolis adding a touch of authenticity. If it was unrealistic that Ann Margaret - who, after all, was teaching English at university and would by definition have access to dozens of eligible males - would marry Jack Lemmon in the first film it is equally unrealistic that Sophia Loren would wed Walter Mattheau here other than for feelgood reasons. On the other hand it's probably churlish to nitpick in this way when the film is only intended to entertain. Which it does. great; This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa As Good As The Original; Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\". I don't agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love \"Buddy Buddy\" and \"The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile. very funny.; This film has some of the funniest lines and it's a great comedy. One would probably think, even I, thought that this would probably happen between two older men who fight about the obvious: women, fish and each other. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are a perfect pair. Even though it's a comedy, the romance in it is on the clean side. Nothing too distasteful and the comic relief is still included into the romance, which gives it a continuous comic flow. Even though there is a serious part of the film where John's father passes away, after that scene the film is back to the comic feel, which is nice because there's no dwelling on the sad/serious scene. Nonetheless, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh hard. Sweet and Sad; In this bright sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\" we find John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) at it again. The rivalry never stops. This time, they are bickering over their children's nuptials, almost causing a wedding not to occur. Sophia Loren co-stars as Maria in this foray into the land of 10,000 lakes as the new girl in town that Max has an eye for. At first, they both hate one another because she is turning his beloved tackle shop into a restaurant. Comedy ensues as Max and John both try to get the restaurant shut down and condemned. Eventually, as in the first film, love finds a way. However, sadness veils over as well when Burgess Meredith's character dies. Other than that, the film is very enjoyable. Cute sequel that works; Fun story of two older men who never quite outgrew boyhood, and the ladies they love. What a treat to see two master actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, working with silly material and enjoying every minute of it. The lady loves, Ann Margret and the ever-sexy and dazzling Sophia Loren, do equally well with a lightweight, sometimes over-the-top script. The principals are aided by a uniformly fine supporting cast, including Burgess Meredith as the Lemmon character's outrageously lecherous dad, and Ann Morgan Guilbert as Sophia's feisty mama. The older players' interaction is a delight. My only quibble with this film is the fact that Meredith's character dies without getting married like everyone else. Why? I wondered whether Meredith had perhaps expired during filming, but, according to Wikipedia, the actor lived a whole two years following this movie's release! The original film, \"Grumpy Old Men,\" takes place during a picturesque Minnesota winter, with snow used to charming effect. The follow-up capitalizes on a Midwestern summer. Like apples and oranges, both productions satisfy. the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. 2/5 stars - John Ulmer Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! The good, the bad, and the just plain miserable...again; It's not uncommon for a movie sequel to do little to the formula that made its predecessor so financially (and hopefully critically) successful. The old \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" method of filmmaking has been used in the Hangover, Home Alone, and Taken franchise to only modest success in terms of quality. However, in Grumpier Old Men, the sequel to the fine comedy Grumpy Old Men, handles the rehashed formula better than many film sequels do. While I'm getting to sound repetitive and out of descriptive words, this is largely because of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's chemistry together on-screen. From the moment they appear, it's almost impossible to believe the men's friendship in real life wasn't lifelong and consisted largely of playful torment, vulgarity, and several boys nights out. Had the film been a sequel with few returning cast members (say Lemmon and Matthau were substituted by two other actors), this sequel would've likely been a somber affair to view. In a way, I'm thankful the town of Wabasha Minnesota hasn't really changed much since our last outing, with the exception of John Gustafson (Jack Lemon) marrying Ariel (Ann-Margret) from the original film. In the meantime, John's dad still lives off a diet of beer, cigarettes, and bacon and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), John's cantankerous neighbor, still finds himself engaging in petty neighborhood battles with John about outwitting the other man. However, the big ordeal this time is not competing for a new neighbor's love but trying to save a local bait shop from becoming a \"restaurante\" for Italian cuisine. The restaurant is managed by Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren), a gorgeous but uncompromisingly strict woman who catches the eye of Max even as him and Jack plan to foil the restaurant's forthcoming prosperity. Other events (aka subplots) occurring in Wabasha are the wedding between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah), a plot which would later be used by the same director Howard Deutch in The Odd Couple II, also starring Lemmon and Matthau, along with John trying to get his father (Burgess Meredith in his final role, which was burdened by spouts with Alzheimer's and difficultly remembering lines, some female company as he gets older. One of Grumpier Old Men's immediate issues is that there is simply too much going on between plot-strands that involve marriage/romance troubles (I counted four including John's brief trouble with Ariel later in the movie) ad others that involve trying to sabotage the bait-shop-turned-restaurant. Grumpier Old Men may have too many new ideas for cutesy subplots, but it keeps the tone and feel of its predecessor alive and well. It still feels like Wabasha is the location of a sitcom with its oddball situations that seem to consistently bear hefty consequences for its residents, but its characters still feel like real people we've come to known and care about. Unsurprisingly, Lemmon and Matthau share unbelievable conversational beauty in the way they engage in simple discussions that seem to constantly end in uproariously funny bickering. Once you minimize your focus on that aspect in the film, you have just an average comedy that, while charming and pleasantly safe (a good and bad quality for this particular kind of picture), is just grateful to be buoyed by two very talented leading men. Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Sophia Loren, and Burgess Meredith. Directed by: Howard Deutch. A vibrant sequel that's still underwhelming; I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They seem to work perfectly together, and with a better script, this movie could be gold. We are taken back to Minnesota to re-visit the old grumps who now have to plan a wedding for their very plain and very boring children. There's a reason Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah have never had substantial film careers- they're very uninteresting actors. But I digress. If \"Grumpy Old Men\" built up it's laughs, \"Grumpier Old Men\" topples them down. The best moments of both films are when Lemmon and Matthau trade vicious insults at one another, and also play pranks on each other. But when this is taken away, we're suffering every old cliché in the book, including Walter's tiresome 'Wholey Moley' line which is used so much, it could be taken into context for a Shot Party (take a shot every time Matthau 'Wholey Moley''s himself). The other problem with this series is the fact that gorgeous women fall for these two farts. Roger Ebert made a very valid point in his review for this film- first Ann-Margaret moves into the neighborhood and marries Jack Lemmon. Now the even more gorgeous Sophia Loren has set her sights on the incredibly unattractive Matthau. And why? For concepts in the plot. There's no reason a woman as beautiful and intelligent as Loren would fall for the dull and disgusting figure Matthau is. I know this is a comedy, but come on now! All in all this sequel is peppier and a little more fun then the original, but both movies suffer from overblown dramatic passages that are not needed. We want to see the old guys go at it, not Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah. I laughed a lot at this movie- mostly at the incredibly underrated Bergis Meredith as the foul-mouthed Grandpa. Since all three main actors have passed, we'll never see them again. At least Margaret and Loren are still alive and kicking. I'd love to see their movie: \"Grumpy Old Widows\". The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5. Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. not much fun; Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still combative while maintaining their truce. John is married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) now and his father (Burgess Meredith) is still spry. Everybody is chasing after the big fish Catfish Hunter. Meanwhile, their children Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are planning to get married. Newcomer Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in Wabasha to buy the bait shop and turn it into an Italian restaurant. It's a continuation that's missing much of the fun. It is contrived. It's great to see these great actors working together but that's all I got out of it. I found very few laughs. Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. Back For More!; CONTAINS SPOILERS John Gustafson and Max Goldman are back in their first adventure since their last. It's six months later and they're still fishing. All the snow has melted and the neighborhood looks very different. The boys are out to catch a giant legendary fish they've heard tell about.          These men would soon discover big changes happening. Like, their friend Chuck, who died in the last adventure, had operated the bait shop. Ever since his demise, it's been empty, but some people have come with plans to turn it into a ristorante (restaurant). They are: Mama Regetti and daughter Maria. John and Max don't want that to happen so they pull numerous pranks on the Regettis but they still won't leave.         Jacob Goldman and Melanie Gustafson contemplate matrimony. But have their doubts when their fathers insist on planning the event. But when the kids decide the wedding is off, John and Max are back at it. Pulling all sorts of foolish pranks on one another. Max steals John's outboard motor, John wrecks Max's fish net and has his cat scratch up Max's car seats, but Max sends a big dog through John's house. Ariel decides to leave for a while. John was in a real pickle. He tried asking his father for advice, but he had passed away; Max goes on a date with Maria and they decide they like one another.        Pretty soon, it's a wedding day. En route to the church, Max and John decide to fish for the giant musket they're so fond of. They catch it, but John says they must leave it in the lake out of respect for his father, so they do and rush to church. It looks like the wedding of Jacob and Melanie, but it isn't. They eloped. It's the wedding of Max and Maria. John planted Max's dog in the limo as they drive off.        Was this as good as the first? Sure. I'm sorry to say that the three main stars, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith are no longer with us. Meredith died in 1998, Matthau in 2000 and Lemmon in 2001, which is real sad. So it's guarenteed there will never be an Even Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple III. They were really funny men. Why do the good ones always gotta die? But anyway, if you're a fan of these men and you enjoyed the first one, then I recommend Grumpier Old Men! - Still having a good ol' time!; I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men back to back, so I could see both instead of my normal rent one sequel at a time ordeal. I just finished Grumpier Old Men this morning and was expecting a modest sequel, but it turned into a great sequel, pretty much to the point where I enjoyed Grumpier Old Men to Grumpy Old Men. Despite the fact that they use some old jokes, this was a fun plot and I thought the guys have gotten even funnier, including John's father, he's a little dirty, but so much fun to laugh at. John and Max are now best friends again and couldn't be happier with each other, their son and daughter are about to get hitched, and they are overwhelming with the wedding plans. Max is starting to get lonely though, since Chuck has passed on, the bait shop is given to two older Italian women, one lady, Maria, starts a little feud with Max wanting to turn the bait shop into a restaurant. But their anger turns into a hidden passion and they end up falling head over heals for each other, but Maria has some hidden skeletons in her closet. Grumpier Old Men is proof that you are never too old to fall in love or have your heart broken again. It was so sweet seeing Max fall in love with Maria, I loved their passion for each other, it was so fun to watch. John's father and Maria's mother were just so awesome and funny, they had such great chemistry! I would highly recommend Grumpier Old Men, it's a great comedy that once again touches your heart and tickles your funny bone. 8/10 1/10; this movie sucked! I hate it! It's so boring! The acting is so bad! Why does Sophia Loren's italian character talk english to her italian mother when they're alone? The script is so bad! It's so corny! Max and John fighting with the fishing things is so silly! This movie was never funny! It was painful to watch, i'm telling you! Avoid it! Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter &amp; Jack's previous films together. It was this film &amp; the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max &amp; John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life &amp; Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau &amp; Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman &amp; John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a 7.4 out of 10 Snoozing sequel with the leads in need of some No-Doz; Woeful, disappointing sequel to 1993's hit \"Grumpy Old Men\" is more retread than follow-up. The two crotchety neighbors--Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--bicker over their children (who will soon be making the sparring oldsters in-laws!) and, of course, who has the better fishing skills. They stop trading insults long enough for Matthau to begin irritating a new woman in town, a fiery Italian who has just opened her own restaurant. Sitcom humor with a sometimes-raunchy twist that is no longer fresh. Almost worth-seeing for Sophia Loren's funny, lively performance, but everyone else looks a little sleepy. Ann-Margret (who married Lemmon's character at the end of the original) must've dropped in for a day and a half to complete her work. As the youthful couple, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah are also under-used. ** from **** As equally funny as the original, but with an Italian flair!!!!; This sequel to Grumpy Old Men is as funny as the original. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and the rest of the cast from the original movie reprise their roles. John and Max are still feuding, but the tension between them has softened. There are, however, some changes: Ariel and John are married and there's a new girl in town named Maria Ragetti. She's moved to Wabasha to open up an Italian restaurant at the former Chuck's Bait place. When the boys discover what Maria's intentions are, they hatch a scheme to ruin the grand opening of the restaurant and try to keep Chuck's business going, even though the inventory of the former business has been cleared out and the interior remodeled to look like an Italian restaurant. Max and Sophia meet, but there's a disagreement about what the place should be. Maria goes to the neighborhood bar to try and reason with Max, but to no avail. It seems as though Max and John have trouble saying goodbye to what is no longer there. The humor between Lemmon and Matthau's characters is still spiced up and is still able to put viewers in stitches. Then, Max and Maria get married, and the restaurant starts selling bait, as well. Great movie, great cast, great fun!! Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) funny funny; I, too, found the film very funny and until reading about it here couldn't remember who played the other woman with Burgess Meredith at the end of the film, the scene that made the whole film complete.  Without giving away what happened at the end of the film, the other woman was that gorgeous elder lady of many great films - Sophia Loren.  What a delicious surprise!  Good also for any old grumpy man! Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. 7/10 stars. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT 7 out of 10 \"Good Lemmon &amp; Matthau Comedy Sequel!\"; Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Kevin Pollack, Daryl Hannah and Burgess Meredith star in this 1995 comedy sequel. This takes place about 6 months later where John (Lemmon) is now married to Ariel (Margret) and he and Max (Matthau) are sort of getting along. This time, Max finds romance when he meets Maria Ragetti (Loren), an Italian widow who moves into town and opens a restaurant. Jacob (Pollack) and Melanie (Hannah) are also engaged and things start to get a bit difficult for them which makes their dads feud with each other, but only temporarily. The late, Meredith (Rocky) also returns as John's father and this was his final film. This is a good sequel and like the first film, it provides laughs and a bit of heartfelt moments as well. I recommend this. Oh, How The Mighty Have Fallen...; GRUMPY OLD MEN (3 outta 5 stars) GRUMPIER OLD MEN (2 outta 5 stars) I dunno why I even bothered to watch the second one. Oh, I guess because it was on cable TV shown as a double bill with the original \"Grumpy Old Men\". I liked the original when I first saw it. It was not the best work by the Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau team... but it had its moments... these two actors could probably read pages from the phone book to each other and still make it funny. Unfortunately, the sequel has even FEWER of those moments. Still, I maintain that no movie with either Lemmon OR Matthau in it can be *totally* worthless. This is probably as close as they ever got, though. (Bear in mind that I have not yet seen their last movie together, \"The Odd Couple II\".) Practically the same plot as the first movie... Lemmon and Matthau play lifelong acquaintances and next door neighbors who are constantly bickering about fish and/or women. Burgess Meredith plays Lemmon's FATHER... and if you find old people talking dirty hilarious then you'll probably love his scenes (especially in the closing credits outtakes). Ann Margaret and Sophia Loren play the women in the grumpy guys' lives... hard to imagine that women as attractive as they still are would want anything to do with these two old dorks but, hey... I guess pickings are slim after 65. Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. A sequel that's equal to the original comedy; The first go round was such a hit, that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau got together for this sequel to the 1993 smash hit, \"Grumpy Old Men.\" And \"Grumpier Old Men\" is every bit as good as the first film. It has some new characters and the scene changes from winter to summer, then winter and spring. Most reviewers don't talk about the surprise of the wedding in the first film. And I won't do that for that film or this one. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) team up for a time in the movie to plan the wedding of their daughter and son, Melanie and Jacob (played by Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak). And, later, to try to thwart the conversion of their bait shop into an Italian restaurant. Sophia Loren is the added ingredient for much humor as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti. She's a cousin of \"Spaghetti\" Ragetti, whom John and Max know. Her mother is in the picture, Mama Ragetti, played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. And, grandpa Gustafson is back, with Burgess Meredith now a couple years older. He tells son, John, as they sit by the lake drinking beer, that he sometimes thinks God has forgotten about him. The hijinks and capers in this film include some hilarious pranks the two friendly enemies pull on the Ragettis. As with the original film, this one supposedly takes place in Wabasha, Minnesota. While it is a real town on the Mississippi River border with Wisconsin, the filming for this and the earlier movie was done in a number of places around that area of southeastern Minnesota. So, anyone going to Wabasha won't find the fishing lake, the town overlook or some other scenes shown in these films. With the 10 films they made together  especially the nine comedies, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have delighted audiences for decades. May they outlive Catfish Hunter and continue amuse people for decades to come. OLDER, HORNIER AND STILL FRUSTRATED IN MINNESOTA;  `Grumpier Old Men' is a film that is a sequel to `Grumpy Old Men.' Reprising their original roles are Jack Lemmon as John Gustafson, Walter Matthau as Max Goldman, Ann Margaret as Ariel, Burgess Meredith as John's father, Kevin Pollock and Darryl Hannah as the children of Max and John. They are still next-door neighbors, only now the feud has subsided. Their children are living across the street in Ariel's house.  The marriage of their children is on the horizon. The setting for this film is summer and fall in Minnesota.  Fishing is still the main sport where `Catfish Hunter' is still the elusive prize.  The bait shop on the lake has been closed since Chuck passed away.  It is now under new management.  John and Max are anxiously waiting the reopening.  To their surprise, it is not being reopened as a bait shop, but a ristorante (restaurant).  Here enters Sophia Loren as the new proprietress Maria Sophia Calotti Ragetti.  Ann Guilbert who plays her mother joins her.  When Max and John find out the new plans for their favorite bait shop, they set out to undermine her plans for a grand opening.  A series of misunderstandings set off a domino effect that touches everyone's lives.  New loves are found and an old feud is rekindled. All of the same emotions that were in the previous film are in this film. There is laughter, sadness, anger and happiness.  Catfish Hunter makes his film debut, which, in essence, puts a `face' with a name.  His film appearance pays credence to the fact that he is a `real' fish and not just a myth.   The acting in this film is superb both by human and non-human.  The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down. Loren is still hot; Grumpy old men was an OK comedy with a nice performance by Ann-Margret, but otherwise forgettable. This film, on the other hand, has some real comic touches that actually also have something to say about the aging process - and life really doesn't end until it ends. But first the bad news: Daryl Hannah. I've liked her in other films, but she is so flat in this, she's a distraction. She doesn't have the feel for these characters, not even her own, and so doesn't quite fit. She's not even credible as the mother of the young girl who is so important in her relationship to great=grand-dad Burgess Meredith. There must have been some plot device they could have come up with to leave her out of the picture altogether; oh, well. Now the really good news: Sophia Loren. I admit I have always had a crush on her since I saw Houseboat as a kid; and when I saw the shower scene in Arabesque, i couldn't sleep for a week. Her performance here is splendid (romantic comedy is one of her strengths, after all), but the really really good news is that she was past sixty when she made this film, and she looks hot enough to burn a young man's fingers! Really - if I'd been Walter Matthau in that bar scene, I'd have gone out with a heart-attack right there - and smiling. With an adequate script, and such superb actors, Deutsch wisely lets the formula roll on without interference. Consequently, whatever the short-comings there's plenty to remember fondly from this film. Oh, and don't miss the blooper-reel that runs under the final credits - Matthau and Meredith are having a grand old time. Oh, and Sophia Loren is still hot. Grumpier Old Men (1995) **1/2; More of the same for those who enjoyed the first film, nothing great but a decent time killer. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return in their twilight years as the ever-battling duo, but this time with the added attraction of Sophia Loren who still looks gorgeous at age 60. She winds up posing a threat to their favorite bait and tackle shop when she decides to take it over and turn it into an Italian restaurant. Since Lemmon's already got sexy Ann-Margret as his hot girlfriend, Sophia hits it off with old man Matthau (ah, the magic of movies), who does not look as good for his age (75). Burgess Meredith is better used in this one in his role as Lemmon's naughty old pop. **1/2 out of **** charming and funny light romantic comedy; It may be just me but I found Grumpier Old Men way way better than Grumpy Old Men. I laughed more and got involved in the plot much more. That it is totally 100% predictable every step of the way is only one of its charms... its how you get there where the fun is. And these actors turn in surprisingly memorable performances for such a slight film. I thought Sophia Loren turned in one of her most charming and funny performances, as did everyone else. The story was just more interesting and three dimensional than the first film and flowed more organically. The story line is simple ancient classic romantic comedy that these veterans had done so many times, it seemed for them like doing a well-known dance. The fun is not in surprises but in going through the old steps with joy. The actors move through their paces with simplicity and enthusiasm and the film actually captures very well the effects of love. The whole film hangs together and works in a way that, for me, the first one didn't. It gets airborne. It deserves a higher ranking than my seven except the story is a little too well-worn. It also allows the two protagonists to get a little more real with each other. Even the three charismatic animal actors get caught up in the spirit of fun. One thing about the film that gave me trouble was that all four women being courted in the film are talented, accomplished, strong and magnificent while all four of the men are hamstrung. I found it mysterious that these women, dropped by some miracle into this tiny town, would be so strongly attracted. Pretty Dang Funny; John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. We often expect sequels to be weaker than the original. But sometimes we may be pleasantly surprised. In this sequel, the \"grumpy old men\" are still up to their old tricks, going after each other and teaming up to close down a restaurant. Some of it may be a bit far-fetched (in real life, a store owner would get the cops involved) but it's good fun. Sadly, the film has the distinction of being Burgess Meredith's final film. On the plus side, he really goes out with a bang. His acting and delivery of witty lines is top notch, and the film does a great job of hiding his Alzheimer's. You can really feel the talent in his character. It has it's moments; Howard Deutch decided he wanted to cash in on the success of Grumpy Old Men and it worked. The only problem to the sequel is that some of the cast seem to be a bit bored by the proceedings. The one liners are enough to make you drop your popcorn. Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon are a joy to watch as they continue to find ways to drive each other over the edge into insanity. And yet Deutch calms that insanity by giving us a quick glimpse into just how much these two men mean to each other when Jack's dad played by Burgess Meredith dies. Lemmon and Mathau are still at the top of their game in this film. In this film the Ann Margaret character is suppose to be the rock, the sound of reason, the calm in the midst of the storm. You believe she is until she has the insanity thrust upon her and is forced to react. For the most part Ann Margaret as well as Daryl Hannah seem bored throughout the entire film. Kevin Pollack is just as good in this sequel as in the original. Burgess Meredith is the scene stealer, he manages with dead pan accuracy to deliver some of the best one liners in the film. Ann Morgan Guilbert manages to match Burgess with her ability to respond to his one liners with shock and outrage befitting her character. And then you come to Sophia. Sophia is in her comfort zone here. Sophia is comfortable with the slapstick comedy and relishes it, she's in the movie, she's not walking through it. She's absolutely stunning to watch but at the same time she adds to the moment. She's as glamorous as ever but it doesn't get in the way. All in all a good follow up to the original. Good Laughs; Grumpier Old Men (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to Grumpy Old Men have Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau returning with more fights and foul language. This time out Lemmon is still happily married but Matthau is on the move and takes a special interest in an Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved to town. I think the most remarkable thing about this film is how well Loren looked. Even at 61 she's still a head turner and her comic timing isn't too bad either. I'm sure this film was only made because the first one made money but it doesn't really matter as no one should take this too serious as it's just a silly comedy meant to make you laugh. There are plenty of nice laughs here but I don't think it's as good as the original. This certainly isn't in the league as The Odd Couple but we do get a pretty good throwback to that film here as there's a scene where Lemmon has to spend the night with Matthau but can't put up with his dirty house. Ann-Margret returns but is pretty much wasted as is Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak. The perverted Burgess Meredith is back and steals the scene every time he's in it. Both Matthau and Lemmon are naturally very good and they easily slip back into their roles. It's priceless watching the two men work together even when the material isn't as strong as one would hope. Lemmon gets a special notice here due to a very touching scene with Meredith. Another problem is the direction, which has one of those \"made for TV\" feels to it. In the end this film could have and should have been a lot better but the cast make it worth watching. Delightful acting and script but silly scenes...; Always delighting in Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, warmed by their aging and childish pranks, I enjoyed this film which is filled with delightful acting and fun script.It suffers, however,  from more than a few silly scenes. Great!; This is a rare sequel. Wait a minute, sequels aren't rare. Well, that's true, but a *good* sequel is rare. Most of the time, sequels aren't even in the same league as the originals. However, due to excellent writing, a superb cast and great direction, this film is every bit as enjoyable as Grumpy Old Men. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made several films together and they worked together extremely well. The gorgeous Ann Margaret reprises her role from the first film and is now Lemmon's wife. A new lady hits town and Matthau is very interested. This lovely creature is played by Sophia Loren, who is still stunningly beautiful. Burgess Meredith is great as Grandpa. The stellar cast ensures great acting. However, this film is also written such that there is literally a laugh nearly every minute. I found the film to be highly enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh. Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the 1st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. One of the best movies of 1995!; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Is it better than original?; Is this movie better than the original? Perhaps. It's probably funnier than the original. Walter Matthau's pick-up line is one of the funniest things of the movie. But is it better than the original? The original had more of the emotions of Lemmon and Matthau as they fought. This one has less feuding (but still has some of the old pranks) and more focus on the family / dating relationships of the old men. This movie is funny and definitely worth watching. You'll have to decide on your own if it's better than the original.</td>\n",

       "      <td>An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Excellent for the broken heart...; Perhaps the reason they call this movie a chick flick, is because that's exactly who it's aimed at. Women. I don't see this as a man bashing movie, but more as a \"how do you deal?\" type of movie. It covers every situation: The unworthy co-worker, The drug-addict boyfriend, the gay husband, the cheating husband, the married man, the New Years fling, the sweet attractive neighbor, the teenage son....but most importantly, it show how women react and deal with the lies, the cheating, and the friendships between both men AND women...and how to survive from that. Any woman who has ever gone through a relationship can relate to this movie, regardless of race, situation, or age. You will want to scream, cry and laugh throughout the whole movie, and I can guarantee that every woman has got a little Angela Bassett in her, especially when she rips through her ex-husbands belongings. Two thumbs up...A definite must-see for any woman with a wounded heart. This film does Terry McMillan's writing no justice; This movie had great potential had it landed in the right directors hands (as seen with How Stella got Her Groove Back).  Many rough cuts, sloppy editing, and terrible lighting at times to name a few.  Casting was excellent with the exception of Whitney Houston who has the tendency to over-chew her scenes.  Though much of the book was not adapted to the film the strength and love amongst four friends was apparent.  It was the one thing that was not lost or left on the cutting room floor.  Good movie, better book. Waiting to Exhale (the movie) ***** (5 stars) Waiting to Exhale (the novel) ********** (ten stars) FAbuLOuS; Simply fabulous. I thought it was a great movie. I was completely empowered! It made me want to start my exes car on fire. Embrace your independence  watch this movie. (is great to watch with the scorned over glasses of wine and bon bons) It'll make you laugh, cry, get mad, and then plot getting even. I can waste a lot of your time telling you to see it, defending it from what others say about it, or just generally talking it up. But haven't you always wanted to see Angela Basset throw a fit? How bout cut her hair off? And who wouldn't want to watch Whitney act with humility. This is by far my favorite movie with Whitney - second, The Bodyguard - third, The Preachers Wife. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Pathetic; This film is simply about a bunch of women who pick men who's behaviors they claim to hate &amp; then spend the rest of their time complaining about them. It seems that this view is held by many women &amp; possibly accounts in some measure to the number of women who consider their relationships with men to be unsatisfying. This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation. Hilarious in Parts; 1995 was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in 1995, the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops &amp; horrible movies. Don't Exhale Just Yet; I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It's not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others, it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However, the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria -- even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger, Holly Hunter, Alfre Woodard and others. Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight, insecure no-nonsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight, but she was the only one who found it (and deserved it). She was the only one who didn't sleep around, wasn't a man basher, set a good example for her son, and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face -- look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things, her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent, good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie. Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package --- beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life - she could now start her catering business, she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end. Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book, you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men. Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same -- Whitney Houston being well groomed, pretending to be well spoken and classy, and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise (although she might have been too young). The character had to tell us she was smart -- in a phone conversation with her mother she said \"I'm smart, I'm a good person and I work hard.\" Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills, doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end. This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn't \"tell this story\" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were. Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue? Double Standard; So I finally got around to watching \"Waiting to Exhale\" on Encore the other night and I don't understand why this became a hit. (Note: spoilers ahead) As far as I can tell, the basic premise of this film is that all men are insensitive, callous and unfeeling; especially towards women. Okay, well and good. That is the storyline? Fine. Men suck, got it. But there is a huge double standard here; two of the women are dating married men and clearly, we are meant to be sympathetic about their plight as they whine and cry about not having \"their\" man with them at night in bed. How about this? STOP DATING MARRIED MEN! Maybe that's your problem in the first place. Now, on the flip side, Angela Basset's character is abandoned by her husband for another woman. Yet, if you pay attention, even this character is not completely innocent. When her husband informs her he is leaving, the things she says makes it clear she's known about his lover(s) for years but ignored his infidelities. Why? Obviously, because he's so wealthy. She liked all the \"stuff\" a little too much to have confronted him about it. Again, she's made her bed here, not as completely as the two who are actively cheating, but still. She spends the rest of the movie being so angry that he left her you never really grow to like her. Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer; he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar. With their clothes on, which apparently means it's oh-so-platonic and sweet. Then he writes her a letter months later, thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off, he'll contact her again. Did anyone else think this was more than a little sleazy? I would hope if I were dying of breast cancer that my husband wasn't out sleeping around (and I do mean just sleeping) with other women. Sweet, platonic, whatever; I think it's pretty horrible. Bottom line; the characters you're supposed to connect to are unlikable and the ones you're supposed to hate are just pathetic. Not very enjoyable. However, I did give it three stars for the music, which didn't suck too badly and the clothes and style. It's a nice little snapshot of how things looked in '95. And the print wasn't very faded. That's about it, though. Extra in Movie; I was actually an extra in this movie and had a quite a fun time hanging out w/the cast/crew. I had an opportunity to be at several of the locations for days of filming and it was a lot of work. You don't realize what a day of filming entitles until you actually do it and I was just an extra. I was more interested in the process of the film making than being on camera so it was a great opportunity. I even got \"spoiled\" and met a lot of the cast and drove around in the SUV's that are for the main cast...fun stuff! I think over all the movie was to enjoy for fun. I think the basis of the friendships were the most important aspect of the film. That through all the craziness of men in their lives they were still there for one another. This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Good movie, Better book; This wasn't a bad movie. The acting was great (although Whitney Houston still seems mediocre). Some of the scenes were powerful and funny. However, unlike the book which also deals with the sisterhood of Black women, the movie becomes a long \"Men are pigs\" tirade that gets weary after a while. Plus it's sometimes hard to root for the characters. For instance, considering all the one-night stands Savannah has, it's hard to see why she's questioning her ability to find a good man. Overall, Waiting to Exhale, is basically a sorely-needed bonding movie for African-American women that, while a little biased, is good escapist fun. Sticky; There was nothing in the movie that made me excited. The message did not come through,  if there was one. Perhaps it is to convey the idea that men are useless,  or that relations are complicated because women make it complicated. If a comedy,  I did not laugh.  If a drama,  I did not find it dramatic. It was like drinking a cup of coffee presented to you with way too much sugar. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. Whitney ruined the great potential; Angela Basset was good as expected, but Whitney has no Range as an actress. The screenplay also neglected to portray, on film, the greatness of this novel.  Instead of promoting sisterhood, they emphasized the canine-qualities of men.  Read the book; rent Soul Food instead! Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. I wanna move to Arizona; I thought It was a great movie, although it is a lot of sleeping with other women husband that are taken, we all have to be honest, this goes on a lot in reality. it's not right, but it happens.... Overall I really enjoy the movie because it took me way back to 1995, the movie was great. great times, although I was just 11 when it came out, I remember all the hype over this movie from my mom n my aunts.... One factor that I've never notice before was the setting... It makes me wanna pack up my family an move to peaceful Arizona.. Great Movie. r.i.p. Whitney Houston I cannot believe it took me all this time to see this movie all the way through... Frustrating...; That's the word I'd use to describe the film, an adaptation of Terry McMillan's 1992 best-seller. It's not great, it's not bad, but it's frustrating to watch, and the fact that I'm of the male persuasion undoubtedly had something to do with it. Now, let me be the first to say that I did enjoy seeing a group of strong black women portrayed onscreen. To say that Hollywood has been exceedingly lax in this regard is an understatement. But it would've been nice if their collective talents hadn't been squandered on this disgustingly anti-male tirade. Especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine, who otherwise shine in everything their names are attached to. Good, solid movies about sisterhood are probably needed now more than ever, but not at the cost of shortchanging the good, upright, decent brothers out there, whom this movie largely forgets about (with some notable exceptions -- Gregory Hines, for example.) And the frustration doesn't end there. Both Savannah and Robin manage to find themselves involved with the most shady characters (a married man and a dope fiend, respectively), yet they complain about the lack of good men out there. I suppose it would be silly to question just where they've been looking, even though it might hold the answer. The sad thing is that there are fellas out there who have little to no regard for women (\"the scum of the f__king earth\", to quote Savannah), and women who fall for fellas like that for the most silly, shallow reasons. If it wasn't for Bassett, Devine, and Babyface's score, this movie would barely be watchable. As it is, it's a moderately entertaining diversion, albeit a frustrating one. A 3 is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. great touching story; While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life's mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Great female flick of the '90s!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track 6: This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! A real disaster!; This movie is awful! The caracters are shallow and almost ridiculous, especially Lela Rochon. It's a very, very, very bad soap opera. I was watching this movie with my wife and we were laughing almost all the time. It is much too long, with no rhythm with absolutely no emotions. It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one cliché after another. Skip it, it's a waste of time! The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" My favorite movie ever !; I'm so surprised by the comments i read here. Since i saw that movie maybe 10 years ago now, it's one of my favorite movie ever along with boomerang.Maybe it's because i was fairly young when i watched those movies.. but i find them extremely good. I watched the movie before i read the book and it may be the reason why i loved the movie so much. Sure Whitney's acting could have been better but she managed to do a pretty decent job overall. As for the soundtrack it's a pure bliss for RnB lovers and i would say a classic now. The image of Black men in the movie is very negative but in a sens it pushed to be the exact opposite so it kinda shaped my vision and my life, and \"deepend\" my love of black women. Some parts of the movie are just so classic like the break up between Robin and troy on the balcony and the soundtrack at that moment was some kind of a symphony.. anyways great great movie .. enjoy A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about 15 or 16 and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker. 6 of 10 stars. A bit too soapy but deserves respect for being a positive film for black women; Vannah is travelling to see her friend Bernie while leaving behind all her old live to start anew.  Bernie has just been left by her husband of 13 years for a white woman.  Robin wants to be loved and happy but always makes the wrong choices.  Glo has an estranged husband and the only man in her life is her teenage son.  The four get together through their struggles in love and live as they try to put it all together again. This is very much a woman's film and, as a man, it's easy for me to criticise it for being a weepy or for being a bit of a woman love in, so I won't.  The plot is pure soap opera, the lives and loves of our 4 women, however it is still involving as the four stories all have strengths as well as weaknesses.  The mix of comedy and sentiment is a bit too much 20:80 and at times the sentiment gets too much, but the sassy characters keep the interest. The soapy sentiment isn't helped by a poor soundtrack and poor use there of. In itself I like some of the love ballad r'n'b stuff  but here it felt like it was all over every scene.  This really bogs it down. Also a down side is the whole man hating thing  only a few come off looking good.  I thought the director being a man would help redress the balance but it seemed to have no effect. Why  can someone tell me  was Houston chosen to lead this talented black cast?  Was it because she could do a cut price soundtrack?  She's a poor actress and he spoiled her scenes  she needs to stay in TVM's.  Bassett however is powerful as ever and really steals every single scene she's in.  Devine adds comedy and sauce while Rochon is perfect as the vulnerable beauty going about love the wrong way.  The male cast is great too  there are so many well known faces in this with only two criticisms of them  1  everytime I see Haysbert now all I can think of is his 24 character.  And 2  Wesley Snipes' character just don't convince me at all. Overall to criticise this for being girly or sentimental is to miss the point.  It is actually good to see a film with so many good roles for black actresses.  It's a bit too soapy for my taste but it is funny and involving with a commanding Bassett.  Only Huston, a soppy soundtrack and constant man caricatures spoil it. WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. I give this one 2 out of 10. not bad; this movie and its story are quite good on the whole..........Ms Bassett is the leading and the best actress,for sure.I get her character.she's beautiful and I guess she's blown people away with her beauty and the EASE WITH WHICH SHE FASCINATES.Ms HOUSTON IS NOT TO NEGLECT NEITHER.She looks natural in this one.And despite her little experience as far as her actress career is concerned,she is good even though her story is a bit common .Loretta is divine!Anyways,this motion picture is merely good.There's nothing amazing.And it don't stand out from all the other movies.the only thing that makes me stick to the screen is the complicity and the crude humor on men of the four ladies! Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this 1995 film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. A One-Sided Celebration of African American Feminism; Directed by Forest Whitaker and adapted from a smash best selling novel by Terry McMillan, WAITING TO EXHALE is a glossy, but one-sided look at the relationship between four strong black women and the various men in their lives. The film is one-sided because the screenplay presents most of the male characters as sexist, manipulative pigs without a redeeming characteristic in sight, but the sensitive direction and outstanding performances keep the rather lopsided story watchable. Whitney Houston made an impressive film debut as Savannah, an ambitious television executive caught in a dead-end affair with a married man (Dennis Haysbert). Angela Basset does Oscar-worthy work as Bernadine, a woman who has spent her life being the best wife and mother she knows how to be, who has her world rocked when her wealthy husband (Michael Beach) calmly announces one night before a formal dinner party that he's in love with someone else and wants a divorce. The scene where Bernadine gathers all her husband's stuff and makes a bonfire out of it in her driveway is one of the film's highlights. Lela Rochon plays Robin, a not-too-bright doormat who finds herself pregnant by a man she wants nothing to do with. Loretta Devine is fun as Gloria, a hairdresser who is divorced from her husband, who it turns out was gay, and is struggling to raise her son (Donald Faison) and tries to begin a relationship with a new neighbor (Gregory Hines). If you can accept the fact that in the world of these four women, all men are pigs, then this film can be very entertaining but the top-notch performances by the cast cannot be overlooked. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Feel Good Movie; The acting in this film is phenomenal, especially on the part of Angela Bassett who always does an amazing job (see What's Love Got To Do With It). The inter-cuts work well where they are placed, much like all of the other shots, and keep the films pace and the viewer interested. I've read other user comments and I find their opinions to be completely biased and unwarranted. If you're watching this film looking for profound insight to life you will be disappointed. This film is an adaptation of Terry McMillan's critically acclaimed novel FOR BLACK FEMALES. Waiting to Exhale explores the lives of four female friends. Each woman makes mistakes and has to deal with those consequences. But it is through being there for one another that they overcome these problems and others. For me, most of the negative user comments are from people who the film was not made for, that are only analyzing the film from the story. There is more to a film than it's narrative and when base your full opinion on that alone you are missing out. Plus, for me, it's just flat-out annoying when people who are completely not the target audience bash a film. Note: this is not to say that art cannot breach color, age or sex barriers. But be let's be realistic for a moment. If say, a heterosexual, black, 21 year old female studying Art was asking you for a good movie suggestion for a Friday night...Would you suggest The Dukes Of Hazard? I think not. Not unless you were joking. Hot Soundtrack, Terrible Character Development; Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end.  It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.  However, much of this is wasted on poor character development.  Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover.  What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies.  While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all.  For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script.  Clearly the answer is that it isn't.  Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with.  Why the director didn't see this, I don't know. Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface. 4/10 Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" WAITING TO EXHALE : Waiting To Go Somewhere, But Sadly It Never Does...; WAITING TO EXHALE Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. \"Waiting To Exhale\", Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book, had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it's star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene. \"Waiting To Exhale\" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone. It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn't know the word \"feelings\" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change. For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they've experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don't seem to learn squat. It's like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. \"Waiting To Exhale\" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose. ... D ... Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life. Please. Sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE HARD TRUTH) looked VERY beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts REALLY made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Decent; Those of you who ranted and raved about how horrible this film was really tickle my funny bone. I love to see miserable people hate a movie just because...well, they have nothing to better to do. Not saying this was the best movie I've ever seen. But I agree with others who say that Bassett and Levine are the ones to save this film from drowning with all the other horrible movies. I love Angela Bassett, I'm a huge fan of hers. The scene which depicts the morning after her husband leaves her for his secretary, which would've otherwise been too cliché for my taste had it not been for the way Bernie (Bassett) burned up that BMW! I mean that was classic. Sorry if any of you testosterone-fueled men out there will accuse me of man hating, but I love that scene and will watch it over and over again. Three cheers for Angie. And Devine's character, Gloria seems sort of weak and unable to stand up to even her teenage son, but I love how she bends a little and confesses how she feels to the late Gregory Hines' character. You'll notice Devine's Gloria and Bassett's Bernie are slightly juxtaposed but their chemistry is excellent. If you haven't seen it, check it out, if not for anything but the performance of these two gifted actors. in response to your response; I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Entertaining, but the premise has been worn thin -- it's sweet, but unnecessary.; The original \"Father of the Bride\" with Spencer Tracey is a really good comedy, the remake starring Steve Martin is a good sweet-natured, amiable enough comedy - and I don't really think a sequel was necessary at all. I mean the whole premise is basically the same - before George Banks (Martin) had to grasp the reality of his daughter being married, and now he has to come to grips with the fact that she's having a baby. A nice twist on this is that his wife (played by Diane Keaton) is ALSO pregnant, but nevertheless it's still (basically) the same as the first film in one form or another. Thankfully it doesn't seem like a total cash-in (like so many sequels of this sort do) because it has a certain charm (as did the first film) and is still remarkably entertaining, all considered. But you can tell it was made solely because of the success of the first film - even Martin Short is back with another extended cameo as Franz the wedding manager. Of course you may be wondering why he's involved with a pregnancy, since his business is weddings. Here's a hint: more $$$ for the studio. Martin is basically doing the same thing he did in the first film - the weary upper-class guy who feels overwhelmed by the state of things. Diane Keaton is still very sweet and likable as his wife. The rest of the cast (including Macaulay's little brother Kieran Culkin) range from OK to good. Martin Short, however, is yet again a stand-out and is very funny - he wasn't necessary for the plot but he is funny and a good addition to the movie regardless. Overall I'd say this is one of those sequels that didn't need to be made, but could have been a lot worse. It's sweet, it's got some good lite-comedy moments, and in general it's just an enjoyable family movie that isn't trying to be anything other than simple entertainment -- which it is. Like Cliches?; ...That weren't even funny the first time? I've seen a lot of films with Steve Martin in them, and they all made me laugh.  Until this one. Part one is worth a look..it may make you laugh a couple of times (I think I laughed once).  But I recommend avoiding this one all together. Some of Martin's best work!; First, this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2. If run back to back, they run like one beautiful story. This production is great from start to finish. Everything about it is wonderful, including the story, the acting performances and the direction. This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor. His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances. He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man. This movie is no exception. His performance is comedic, yet startlingly genuine. Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's. I love this movie. I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character; with how he feels, and what he's going through. This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum, and I love it. It's less about family, and more about life's curves; the every-day things that make us crazy, happy, sad, and ultimately stronger. It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think, consider, ponder the events which have led us to where we are now. Combined, they rate 8.6/10 from... the Fiend :. I loved it, but one thing bothered me...; I enjoyed this movie: Diane Keaton is my favourite actress, Steve Martin always makes me laugh and Martin Short is great, but I felt really sorry for Keaton having to pretend to be pregnant. She didn't seem to be enjoying it and when the Banks were at the hospital, she actually looked rather bored, because whenever she spoke from the moment George protested about the doctor's name, she almost made it sound like she was in a maths lesson. Apart from that, it was great! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching Martin, Keaton or Short in a movie or who likes to laugh. 9/10 because of the little problem, but it was great. I loved it. Not bad...but could have been better; The first time I saw Father of the Bride 2 I really liked it.  I still enjoy watching some parts of it but I thought some realistic parts in the movie were not necessary.  First of all, the mother and daughter pregnant together.  This could happen but probably when the mother is not older than 40.  Nina had to be at least 47.  Is it likely that the mother would be pregnant at that age? I don't think so.  Secondly, I could not understand why George and Nina wanted the baby to have two last names.  Children always go by their father's last name and I thought Brian's father made a good observation when he said that George and Nina already had Matt to carry on the Banks name.  So why they thought the baby should have two last names is beyond me.  In conclusion, Father of the Bride 2 is still cute and fun to watch in some parts but I thought the first one was much better Not bad, but inferior to the first; I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the first movie. It was not without sentiment and it was hardly original, but it was still beautifully filmed, well acted, charming and funny. This sequel is not as good as the first I agree, but I still quite enjoyed it. The story is predictable, and there are some so-so parts in the script. Eugene Levy, who I do like by the way, is okay here but his character felt somewhat unnecessary and felt like he was there as an additional character and to give the film a longer length. And I also would have liked to have seen more of Kimberley Williams, she is so beautiful and quite a good actress, but I actually do agree that a little too much time is spent between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. However, it is beautifully filmed, has a nice soundtrack, decent pacing and good direction. And the acting is fine too, Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are still very likable, and while as I've said I would have liked to have seen more of her Kimberley Williams was lovely. And I loved Martin Short here too, he was one of the main merits of the first film, so to see him in his wonderfully fluffy turn again was a very nice surprise. Overall, not bad at all, could have been better, but I liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox Funny Sequel; Geogre Banks is getting used to life without his precious daughter Anne. Now he is thinking about all the free time he will have when his son is out of the house.That`s when Anne announces that she is going to have a baby.Geogre is shocked but he becomes even more shocked when he finds out his wife is going to have baby as well.Now he has to deal Franck helping out with the two pregnant women.Can Geogre ever get a break? This is my second favorite movie.My first is Father of the bride part I.This is a good movie.See it it is a great sequel.It is almost as good as the first one. Steve Martin steals the screen. Loved it!!; I thought the sequel to the first Father of the Bride just showed what a great chemistry Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, George Newbern, and Kieran Culkin, along with all the other supporting actors have together. I would actually love to see a Father of the Bride Part III and I usually hate more and more sequels. I really do enjoy this sequel and I think it is better than the first one. I would reccommend any and everyone seeing this movie (but not without seeing the first one). No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. This is my favorite movie; ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is my favorite movie.  I think it is funny, sweet, and truly touches the heart.  In the sequel to the previous, Father of the Bride, George Banks (Steve Martin) is finally getting over the fact that his beloved daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams)has gotten married.  But then she shocks him with the news that she is pregnant.  Everyone else is thrilled, but George is not.  He believes that he is too young to be a grandfather.  He tries to become young, but doesn't succeed.  Then, both he and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton) are shocked to find out that Nina is also pregnant.  George now thinks he is too old to be a father.  They have one other child other then Annie, Matty (Kieren Culkin.)  Through the chaotic turns of pregnancy, George learns to except the fact that his daughter has grown up and moved on, even though it is hard.  They also have to deal with Fronk (Martin Short,) the goofy wedding coordinator from the first movie, who is now designing the new baby's room.  They then discover that Annie has been given the opportunity to design a museaum in Boston, far away from their own, San Marino, California.  George now realizes that he will miss his daughter more then ever, but he learns to get along.  In the end, he enjoys being a grandfather to baby George, and a father again, to Megan, named after the doctor who delievered her.  In this funny and heartwarming sequel, everyone puts out fantastic performences once again.  Even though I very much enjoy Father of the Bride, I enjoy this much more. Very Warm and Funny.; This movie is a very warm and funny family film. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the Sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny. The only thing I didn't like was Eugene Levy's character, I found that his part was just put there to extend the movie a bit. I also didn't like how they used him in the second one when he was clearly the one who auditioned to be the wedding singer in the first one. All in all this is a great family film where many will enjoy and watch together. One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. Worthy second installment.; Mild SPOILERS are contained in the following comments. However, I believe everyone knows the story and how it turns out. The fun of the movie is seeing the actors, especially Martin. Steve Martin is back as George Banks, having just lost his daughter and basketball partner (Kimberly Williams as Annie ) to marriage, and now she is back home with her husband and a big announcement. She is pregnant. Of course everyone is happy, and the joy is doubled when Nina Banks (Diane Keaton as Annie's mom) finds out she is pregnant too. Poor George doesn't know if he can handle all this. After all, he is about to be a grandfather, he's not prepared to be a new father also. Martin Short is back as Franck Eggelhoffer, the unintelligible wedding planner. All ends well as both mom and daughter deliver their babies at the same time, in separate hospital rooms, so George has to go back and forth. The movie ends a few months later, and as Annie and her new baby are leaving, she gives dad a miniature basketball, a reminder to George that he can raise another basketball partner. Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. Better than the original; This one is definitely better than the original, funnier, smoother pace, and in some places, better acting! Plus Martin Short has more screen time. Great! This is a great movie for anyone who like good clean comedy. Awesome! Five out of Five Moose Stars! great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a 10, i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Deja Vu; I found this sequel to be both charming and entertaining. What I learned tonight is that this movie is actually a remake of the 1951 movie \"Father's Little Dividend\", which in turn was the sequel to the original \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and with the same great cast: Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Bennett, et al.  They both share the same broad comedy and story line (only one pregnancy in the earlier version though), and in their own ways are equally entertaining.  Old or new incarnations, however, be sure to see parts one and two in sequence. Average comedy sequel; There's been better, and there's been worse. \"Father of the Bride Part II\" falls right in between when it comes to sequels of comedies. The plot was easily predictable and the movie didn't have as many Steve Martin funny moments as the original. There were some good moments that made me laugh though, most being scenes with Martin Short. It did seem like sort of a stretch, though that all of the sudden \"Frank\" was an interior designer as well as a wedding/baby shower coordinator. I guess they just needed a way to keep him in the movie longer. I was hoping for a lot more when I rented this. My advice: stick to the original. Touching even in its weak state.; Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, and kimberly Williams Paisley return in Father of the Bride Part 2. The film as a sequel was slightly disappointing, but on the whole, likeable. George and Nina Banks are in for the surprise of their lives when they find themselves middleaged and expecting their third child.  The timing is impeccable as Annie Banks-MAckenzie also realizes that she is expecting. Thus Steve MArtin embarks on a nine month journey that will consist of him building a new room for the baby, watching his daughter become a woman and overdosing on sleeping pills.  Honestly, the film made me laugh hysterically and i shed a few tears at the bittersweet ending. 3 and 1/2 stars out of five. Pretty much just a rehash of the first; As this movie started, it reminded me a lot of the first. Various scenes were reenacted, only a little wackier, sort of like it was trying to be a shade more funny than the first; I guess that is the usual stuff for this type of sequels, but I think it failed at that. Apart from that, the movie pretty much succeeds in being a good sequel to the first. The story is also somewhat reminiscent of the first one. All the same actors return as well, and they are pretty much the same, just a shade more wacky. The story is also told by Steve Martins character, George Banks, like in the first. Pretty much everything in the movie is a takeoff of the first; this doesn't make it bad though, if you liked the first, liked the characters, you'll want to see this too, if nothing else, to see the characters again. It is about as funny and as sentimental as the first was, and as enjoyable. Fans of the first one, or of Steve Martin will most likely enjoy at least some part of it, as this is the typical for both the first movie and Steve Martin. 7/10 Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie. A (Rare) Good Sequel; The first \"Father of the Bride\" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin's great comedic \"Dad\" character with the emotions of marrying off his \"only\" (to that point!) daughter. However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor. Thankfully, \"Father of the Bride II\" does not fall into this trap. With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather. Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton). Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women! Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments. Whereas the first film captured George's equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George's identity crisis. With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family. Overall, this film is just as good as the original. The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare. Let's just say that if a \"Grandfather of the Bride\" were in the works, I would be first in line. My comments are going to be very positive.; Hi! I think that Father of the Bride Part 2 was a great film and very hilarious. I think that the mother and daughter could have been pregnant at the same time!  It was a great movie and I recommend it to all people who want a warm-your-heart comedy! It's a great film! Thanks! I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. I really found this film quite annoying; My basic opinion of this movie is that it is a crappy American feel good comedy. It is simply about a man who is going through another mid-life crisis as his daughter, who was married in the first movie, has a baby in this one. The catch is that his wife is also pregnant and with the irony really dripping, both of them have their babies within minutes of each other. As such the kid's auntie is exactly the same age as him (it won't happen to me, though it is possible). When I watch this movie I think to myself, this guy really doesn't have problems. There are people out there that have much more serious problems than he does. He admits to having a beautiful wife who loves him, owns his own home (or did), has a great job and great kids - and he thinks he has problems. Maybe the whole comedy is in the fact that he is worrying about absolutely nothing, but seriously, when I watch this movie, I simply shake my head and think that the guy is a loser. I really don't think it is all that funny. In fact, the guy has much more serious problems. He seems to be spending an awful lot of money, and is going to find himself in a huge amount of debt, and he doesn't seem to ever be at work. My question is not only where he gets his money, but where he gets the collateral for all of the purchases he is making. He buys back his house for an extra $100,000 on top of what he sold it for, and really, how can he seriously afford it. Okay, it wasn't all that bad. As a movie is was made well, and I did chuckle a few times. But in reality, this guy is a serious loser because he has more than anybody could possibly ask for, and he is worried about growing old. Hell, we all grow old, but he has experience more than what a lot of us have already had. Instead of worrying about growing old, the twit should look back on his life and be thankful for the blessings that God has already given him as opposed to forgetting all of that and winging about his age. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late '40's)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... The Best Movie of All Time; let me tell you.. anyone who does not like the movie is just a little close minded.. i read comments that thought the movie was too unrealistic but thats what makes it so great! i mean look at other movies such as lord of the rings or star wars neither or them contain true reality.. this is why its a movie. Anyway, i loved Steve martin in this movie. he does a magnificent job of playing the character for an over protective dramatic father. he was the best actor. who could have played the part of Nina as well as Diane Keaton. she makes the part of the mom annoyingly overwhelming mother, which is exactly what the point of us as the audience to think of her. martin short is the best of all \"fra'nk's\". the way he seeks George banks's approval is perfect. and lastly Kimberly Williams is the gorgeous daughter we are all expecting her to be.. i watch this movie every night before bed and i can recite every word to this movie. because of father of the bride II i have dreamed to meet Steve martin.. \"hes my hero!!\" hopefully you fall in love with it too. and dream to be pregnant with your mother as did Annie banks. Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. 5/10 And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW2, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. daughter gets married; In the sequel to Father of the Bride we have the daughter getting married and moving away from home, this presents a big dilemma to the father played of course by Steve Martin. Maybe not quite as funny as the first one,, or as good,, but definitely above average,, it's always a pleasure watching Steve Martin work at his craft. The movie is basically about how the family,, especially the parents deal with their young daughter growing up,, getting married, and eventually moving away from the nest.. the cameo from Eugene Levy is just wonderful,, as a real estate agent who is trying to sell the very home where our main character lives.. all in all a very family friendly movie,, that I would recommend. Not as good as the first, but still great fun.; In the sequel to the brilliant Father Of The Bride, Nina Banks and her daughter Annie are both pregnant and George Banks, being his usual nervous self has to learn to get used to the idea that he's going to be a father again AND a grandfather. The whole cast including, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams and Martin Short are all back here giving good performances. Even though Father Of The Bride Part II is not as good as the first Father Of The Bride, this is still a great movie which is enjoyable and fun all the way through and that's why I'm going to give this good sequel a 10/10.  Heartwarming &amp; Hilarious; Steve Martin does it again in this touching and funny sequel to 1991's Father Of The Bride the rest of the cast returns in a new story dealing with the joys of parenthood. I loved Father Of The Bride II not only because it was funny, mostly it was due to the comic antics of a man dealing with two pregnancies at once. He's a great comedian as well as an on screen father, my favorite scene is when both babies arrive at the same time. A year has passed since George Banks (Martin) watched his only daughter Annie (Williams) get married and has accepted her transformation from daughter to wife. She comes home with her husband Brian (Newbern) to announce the wonderful news to her parents, brother Matty (Culkin) and in-laws that she's pregnant. Everyone is thrilled and excited except for George who thinks he's too young to be a grandpa, from then on he tries to act young by dying his hair and exercising. But things are about to get a little crazy when his loving wife Nina (Keaton)discovers she's pregnant too now George must deal with the impending arrival of both his grandchild and his own child. Thrown into the chaos is Franck Eggelhoffer (Short) the wedding coordinator who helps to design a room for the new addition to the Banks family. This movie is not only sweet but it's charming entertainment for fans of all ages. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the 1951 sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of 50. This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! Father of the Bride Part II; The first film was the remake of the original version starring Spencer Tracy and Dame Elizabeth Taylor, and it became very popular, so naturally they felt like a sequel was needed to continue the story. Basically George Banks (Golden Globe nominated Steve Martin) is getting used to the fact that his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) has become the bride now wife and got married to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), and more surprisingly a mother when she reveals she is pregnant. With this revelation comes out George has a small midlife crisis, and he tries to recapture his youth, including dying his hair, but he does eventually settle somewhat and get used to the idea that he will be a grandfather. But then he is shocked to find out he will be a father again as well when his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) reveals that she is also pregnant, and it may appear that both her and Annie's baby will be born on the same day. With these things happening, and the house having leaks and termites there is the opportunity to change things by selling the house to Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy), but he changes his mind later. When George manages to get the house back, despite a higher price, he gets the help of camp wedding planner/coordinator, now interior designer, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) to make the baby rooms and get things ready for the arrival of children. There are a couple of false alarms from Annie where she thinks the baby is coming, but eventually it comes to the real thing, and they rush to hospital, and of course Nina goes in to labour as well. In the end George is very happy to be holding both his new baby son and his new baby granddaughter is his arms, before his daughter and her husband move away to their own new home. Also starring Kieran Culkin as Matty Banks, B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein, Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie and Jane Adams as Dr. Megan Eisenberg. I can see what the critics mean by giving it two out of five stars in certain places, it certainly isn't as funny as the original film, it concentrates more on the sentimental material, but that's not a bad thing for this comedy drama. Okay! A really likable comedy.; I enjoyed this film. I found that it was easy to relate to Steve Martin's character George Banks as a parent. The relationship between him and his daughter Annie, played by Kimberly Williams, was an honest father daughter relationship. I recommend this one for parents in general and empty nesters in particular. The idea of a mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time is plausible and amusing. like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $15k bonus to move out in 10 days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $100k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. Father of the Bride II; Likable, but not as impressive a follow up to the 1991 hit with Martin now dealing with his daughter being pregnant...And, oh yeah...his wife is pregnant again too. good, but a mistake; this movie rocks. but there is one thing weird. okay, so in the beginning Annie says, \"i have lived here since i was 5!\" and then later right when they are selling the house and playing basketball Annie and George(her dad) and her dad says \"i remember the first time we played out here, you were 4.\" wait...so was she 4 or 5 when they moved in??????????? other than that this movie makes me laugh, cry(because i laugh so much), and..........uh.....what was that other thing people say when they say that? i don't really remember. i just love how Steve martin always is so cheap. I am forced to say more so i will say i love that this movie is always on HBO! And i realized something, Steve martin has had white hair like forever! Not as good as the first, but good family fun; This movie is as thin as you can get. Its' emotions are easily played. There are no surprises. It is very predictable. And I say...so what? What is wrong with that? This is an American Dream movie. Everything goes perfectly and everyone is as happy as can be. Why should it be a complicated character study? It deals with the birth of babies. There's no complex feelings that need to be dealt with in this situation. A life is being created. A family is being blessed. A baby's birth is a time for love and hope. This movie has both in spades. It's a very positive movie that shows the joy a new baby brings. Every parent-to-be should watch it. A child's birth is an emotional event with no equal. This movie knows it and milks it for all its' worth. My only complaint is it should have been called Parents of the Bride. Way too much time is spent with the relationship between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. There should have been more attention paid to Kimberly Williams. Not only were the scenes between her and Martin the best scenes in this and the original, but Kimberly Williams is the most beautiful actress to come out of Hollywood in many years. Forget all the blond, silicone filled, bimbos that every teenage boy raves about. Ms. Williams is a natural beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****. Better than the first one!; I love Steve Martin, but I was disappointed by the first movie, so I wasn't expecting as much from this one.  But to my surprise, this one was even better! It's constantly funny, just like one should expect from Steve Martin; it's not preoccupied with corny emotion, like the first movie was. It's Steve Martin in his best performance since \"My Blue Heaven.\" Sometimes sequels can be surprisingly good.  This one is better.  It has all the comedic elements that were stagnant in the first movie.  It's everything the first movie should have been, and more! As I understand it, there were accusations of anti-Arab stereotyping?; \"Father of the Bride II\" may seem to some people like a lesser Steve Martin movie, with him as the patriarch from the previous movie now having to deal with his daughter's and wife's pregnancies. Unpretentiously silly. But one interesting thing is that apparently, some Arab groups claimed that the movie was making anti-Arab stereotypes, as a Middle Eastern man buys their house with plans to demolish it. I wouldn't have interpreted that as anti-Arab; I mean, it's not like they're portraying him as a terrorist. Oh well, life goes on. The movie's a nice, goofy way to pass time. I really liked the scene where they bring Steve Martin into the hospital (that would've sure been an embarrassment!). Also starring Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, B.D. Wong and Eugene Levy. Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video Good, but first one was better; This film is good but you have to suspend disbelief quite a few times. All the performances are fine, with Steve Martin a scream again, and Diane Keaton glowing from start to finish (she has a lot more to do here than in FOTB1). The best scenes are: George trying to get buff in the gym, asking which famous men he's younger than, pointing to his wedding ring at the lady in the car next to him, and seeing all the misbehaving children out the window in his car while his wife sees all the happy kids and their parents out her window. And of course, when George holds his child and grandchild outside the delivery room. My favorite line: \"Now going to the movies will be economical: one child, two seniors, thanks!\" Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Good; This is well worth seeing. Everything goes perfectly. Ain't no such thing as too much Steve Martin, baby. Here Martin carries weak material, but it's a positive movie that shows the joy a new child brings. You will laugh, cry and cheer. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Some of the dialog is a bit lost on US audiences, but still some hilarious lines. The music is amazing throughout. Also the scenery is incredible. I saw the cast had a lot of great comedians, so I thought there would at least be a few laughs. Instead, I was surprised to see a very touching movie, absolutely great script. I give it 7 out of 10. AWESOME!; This movie is great!  I think it's one of the best movies ever made!  I love both Father of the Bride I and II!  I think that it is cute how they have the mother and daughter pregnant at the same time!  I hope that they come out with a Father of the Bride Part III, that would be awesome! :-) Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. 2.5 out of 5 stars. Good, so long as you don't try to think too much; It was a fun movie, but it had no particular substance. I mostly watched it because I'd seen the first one. And because it was free on my cable. Or at least, I wasn't paying only to see it. Now, I have done that before and been pleasantly surprised, but this just wasn't one of those movies. Most of what was in this movie has been done already in the first film, and then it was in a much better way. Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, I'm just glad that I got to watch it free. Sure, Steve Martin's always fun to watch, particularly when he's acting dopey for whatever reason, but that didn't make it a great film. Just mediocre. Still, it's fun for a laugh. A Well-Done Sequel!; A sequel to immensely likable Father of the Bride, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is A Well-Done Sequel! Its enjoyable as well as emotional! 'Father of the Bride Part II' Synopsis: George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. 'Father of the Bride Part II' is worthy sequel of a wonderful prequel. The characters still appeal, the humor works &amp; the emotional moments are heartfelt as well. Nancy Meyers &amp; Charles Shyer's Screenplay is genuinely well-done. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography &amp; Editing are fair. Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains. On the whole, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is a satisfying sequel. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the 1951 movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the 1950 classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the 4 year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. A so so sequel; 'Father of the bride' was a good film and probably didn't need a sequel. But this is Hollywood, everything needs a sequel. While it is clear that a lot of effort has gone into making this sequel work, the central idea stretches credibility and every idea the writer had seems to have been thrown at the wall in a desperate attempt to get laughs. There are moments that remind you of the heart and humour that the preceding film had, but it's a load of nothing really. I went into this film dubious about how good it could be, and I didn't finish watching it any more convinced that the original needed a sequel. \"Father 2\" : Born again.; Okay,now the sequel \"Father Of The Bride 2\",which was surprisingly better than expected. Like anyone who sees a sequel,you expect almost a carbon copy of the first. It does start similar to the first movie,with George sitting in a chair addressing us,the audience. It also does an unfortunate repeat of the fight between Annie &amp; Bryan,again like the first movie,I saw it coming. The baby shower party is not played big,like the first after wedding party but I laughed when actual storks carrying little bundles showed up. I was kind of \"iffy\" on the sub-plot of George selling the house,having to leave in ten days and then blowing a bundle to get it back again. I'm not questioning the probability (we know in reality that'd be impossible),I just found it kind of unnecessary. I did however like his dyed hair and new look,that was hilarious and he should have kept it until the end of the movie. Some may say the idea of a mother &amp; daughter being pregnant at the same time,is impossible. Yet,somehow it works here. It's not just the obvious next step for Annie but for George and his wife too,who thought having babies was way behind them. I love Steve Martin's warped expression when Bryan calls him a \"Grandfather\"! I liked that a woman having a baby in her 40's was taken very seriously,since it's a fact that women who have babies later in life have a more difficult time. It makes for a good piece of drama in a film that's otherwise a family comedy. The comedy is helped once again by the presence of Martin Short and I like that he becomes more involved with the family. Especially helping George out the front door on his back. This after giving him sleeping pills for rest. Once the babies are born and Bryan &amp; Annie head to Boston for a new life,the film gets a very touching ending with George and his new baby girl. 8 out of 10 for the expected repeat of ideas,otherwise a very well made sequel. (END) Fantastic; Both the first movie and this sequel are fantastic. I loved the first movie, so I thought I would give the second one a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised!! The acting from all the characters is amazing, from Steve Martin to Diane Keaton to Kimberly Williams-Paisley. 16 years after its release this movie is still a gem. When I'm feeling down or just need a go-to comedy for a night in, these two movies are the best. For those who say that a 40-something woman is too old to have a baby--that's just not true. Do your research. I bet more people have been in that situation than you think. Anyway, this is a feel-good movie for some great laughs and a few happy tears! Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in 1995. It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. not bad for a sequel; as sequels go,this is film isn't too bad.i didn't think ti was quite as good as the first one,but it's not a bad effort.i didn't find it as funny,and some of Steve Martin's histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me.really,this one doesn't quite have the same sincerity as the first.through much of this movie,i was all too aware i was watching a movie,whereas with firs tone,i was drawn in,and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting.having said that,there are some bright spots.for,one,this movie is just as touching as the first.and Eugene levy has a great cameo.and there is still some fun to be had.even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above,i still think Father of the Bride II is a 7/10 Not exactly the most innovative of films, but still great fun!; This is an excellent, funny, warming film. Although a lot of the \"same kind of thing\" was done in the first movie, it's still entertaining. Steve Martin's character was good, although at times his behaviour is quite pathetic and Martin Short is again entertaining. (Particularly his pronunciation of the word 'pregnant).' Although it's highly predictable and not the most intellectually stimulating of films it is still well worth watching and the vast majority of people would enjoy this film. What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Father of the Bride Part II; The 1991 Steve Martin comedy proved out to be popular enough to earn a sequel, much like the original Father of the Bride of 1950. All of the main cast of the first film returns in a story where the eponymous father George Banks (Martin) has gotten over the stressful wedding of his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) and her fiancé Bryan (George Newbern). However, when she breaks the big news about her pregnancy to the family, the grandpa-to-be becomes anxious about getting older and starts proving his youthfulness in various ways, such as selling the family's beloved house to a greedy real estate developer Habib (Eugene Levy). Life has more in store for George and his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) though, as it soon turns out that Annie's is not the only pregnancy in the family. Again, the humour is best when it relies on Steve Martin's comical talent and charisma instead of craziness and exaggeration. Unfortunately, adhering to the rule of always making sequels bigger and louder, the writers have given more screen time to the unbelievably annoying wedding planner Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) whose noisy and flamboyant scenes are certainly the weakest parts of the whole movie. The fussy bumbling caused by the impending childbirths at the end is also rather annoying and unimaginative. I think the movie works best during the more subtle scenes, such as Martin making uncomfortable faces while hiding his nervousness or arguing about the baby's surname with the overjoyed family during a dinner. Besides the run-of-the-mill jokes, the movie also shamelessly wallows in impenetrable sentimentalism of the newborns' adorability. Especially the music is so unbelievably schmaltzy that it was really getting on my nerves while watching; can't the filmmakers just trust their material's appeal without burying it under a sweety-tweety sugar mountain? Nevertheless, despite the predictability of the plot and the not-so-hilarious jokes, George Banks is a very likable character and Steve Martin is at home in the role, so those who enjoyed the first movie will probably like this one too  the basic building blocks of the story have not been changed at all.</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Playmates; The original meaning of a playmate that is of course. Pixar is inventive, Pixar does great movies. Well, you've heard and hopefully have seen it before. But if you have not watched a movie by Pixar yet, you are in for a treat. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy the movies they do. But they work as family movies, kids movies or just \"plain\" movies. It is only a matter of time until Pixar will win an Oscar. Not for animated picture (they've done that and will be doing it for many years to come), but for Best Picture (period)! Toy Story is a ... well story-fantasy that many kids have while they grow up. And to see that come to life (no pun intended), is just great. Especially because Pixar equally has treats for kids and grown-ups alike. You'd have to be a cynic to not like it, I guess. But if you do not have an aversion against animated pictures, you have to check this one out Came at a time when cgi was not doing well and changed the film industry; The plot is Woody, Hanks, a cowboy toy who is Andy's favorite toy but when Andy goes away, the toys come alive and are concerned because Andy's birthday is coming up and they are wondering who will be replaced. Woody is there to calm everyone down because he is Andy's favorite. Until a new toy called Buzz, Allen, shows up with all the latest in toy technology. Woody tries to fight for attention but thanks to this, they both get lost. The rest of the film is them trying to get back to Andy before he moves. The strength of this movie is the writing and these characters are amazingly written and are put in a great concept. There is only jealousy as the villain and this leads to great comedy. In my opinion, some of the best forms of comedy are made from competition and seeing these two characters trying to do the right thing and just being consumed by jealousy is great to watch. It was also clever and interesting. The film doesn't really have a villain. OK, maybe Sid, who loves to blow up toys, and you either knew this kid or was this kid when growing up. However, even Sid is just trying to have fun. So, he can't really be called a villain. That is why the writers are so good. They make everyone identifiable. The idea of toys coming to life is nothing new, we have seen it before but they put this wonderful little spin on it which just works. The CGI holds up pretty well. Sometimes. The plastic texture make it seem pretty decent but they needed to put more time into the humans because they look more plastic than the toys. That is just nitpicking. The film is still unbelievably good. The throw all their talent and all their effort into this movie. Especially in the writing and the characters, thus making it an animated classic. One that films try to copy even to this day. But this would be the first great success for pixar and the animated CG revolution had just begun. Wonderful Film One of Pixar's Best; I love animated Disney films, although I must say I usually prefer the original classic hand drawn Disney films, at some point we have to accept change, and what better way to accept this change with a wonderful superb film. (I mean common they booked Toy Story 4 already). Toy's come to life when their owner is asleep, and its all about the battle for who is the best and most popular toy. Whenever Christmas or the little boy's birthday come around the toys get nervous that they will be abandoned or replaced. When a new toy arrives they are determined to hate him and ignore him, but they end up becoming friends. Greatest animation film ever; Toy Story was the first full-length children's feature made entirely with computer-generated animation, and it was released in 1995. This film has an amazing plot, with great characters and actress which makes Toy Story the greatest animation film ever. Toy story is a buddy movie/adventure tale with an understated lesson about the value of friendship. \"You can count on me!\" Toy Story was about two toys, an old, beloved cowboy named woody (voice of Tom Hanks) and new beloved space ranger, named Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen). Both of these toys try and compete for the love of the human boy named Andy Davis (voice of John Morris) who plays with them, not knowing that they come alive when he lives the room. Toy Story takes place in Andy's bedroom where Woody is always placed on the bed and the rest of the toys are placed in the chest or on the shelves. One day the toys found out that Andy was having a birthday party and became scared that they might be replaced with newer toys. Woody the leader of the toys, calms the other toys down and sends a team of toy soldiers down stairs to scope out the new coming toys. As Andy is opening his gifts the most alarming arrival was brought to the scene when the new comer Buzz Lightyear was opened. Andy fell in love with Buzz Lightyear and ran up stairs and threw Woody off of the bed and replaced Buzz Lightyear in Woody's place. In the first half of the movie Woody and Buzz didn't get along and fought for the love of Andy and the other toys. As the plot takes a different direction when the family decides to move, Woody and Buzz find themselves stuck at the gas station with no idea on how to get home. This is where the theme of friendship takes over in the film. As Woody and Buzz starts to work together to find their way home Sin, Andy's next door neighbor picks them up. As the toys are placed in Sin's room they see Sin feed other toys to his dog. This is when Woody and Buzz join forces and try to escape the house before Sin feeds them to his the dog. Toy Story remains me of Avatar with the use of the computer- generated imagery. Like Toy Story, Avatar brought the characters to life with the use of all the different colors schemes, lighting and angles. Both of these films characters looked very human like and real and both won rewards for their use of animation. Sparkling family entertainment; Disney/Pixar initiated a new sophisticated form of animation with the 1995 box office smash Toy Story, a richly entertaining and imaginative animated adventure that not only spawned two sequels, but became a merchandising dream. The film opens in the bedroom of a little boy named Andy who is moving in a couple of days. The central characters are Andy's toys, who are led by a cowboy action figure named Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), who is apparently Andy's favorite toy. Woody and the other toys feel seriously threatened when Andy receives a space action figure called Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) for his birthday. Immediate antagonism materializes between Woody and Buzz when Woody feels he might be replaced in Andy's heart, but Woody and Buzz are forced to bond and actually become friends when they become prisoners of Andy's next door neighbor, Sid, a sadistic little kid who likes to torture toys. This deliciously imaginative story works thanks to a brilliant screenplay that brings vivid and believable emotions to toys, effectively showcasing the world from a toy's point of view. The jealousy and resentment between Woody and Buzz rings completely true and is actually the glue that keeps this story moving. Though the story provides consistent laughs, there are a couple of poignant moments as well...watch when Andy stops sleeping with Woody, who gets demoted from Andy's bed to the toy box or watch when Buzz sees a commercial for himself and finally realizes that he is a toy and is not real. As always with Disney animated films, the voice casting is perfection, with standout work from Hanks, whose work here rivals the voice work of Robin Williams in Aladdin...he makes us love and care for Woody and puts us in his corner from jump. Mention should also be made of Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Jim Varney as the Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as a very insecure toy dinosaur, John Ratzenberger as a piggy bank named Ham, and R. Lee Ermey as a toy soldier. Really liked Annie Potts as a Little Bo Peep doll too, though I just couldn't get past my trouble with the fact that a little boy would own a Little Bo Peep doll, but I did not allow this to deter my enjoyment here. Randy Newman contributed a couple of nice songs to the film, one of which, \"You've Got a Friend\", received an Oscar nomination. John Lasseter's direction and his contribution to the Oscar nominated screenplay are the final touches to this entertaining adventure that actually conjured up images of Spielberg work like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future, and though the story does have a couple of extra endings, it is a richly entertaining fantasy adventure that had me laughing and smiling throughout the entire running time. It was a beautiful movie!; I bought a 10th anniversary special edition of Toy Story a few years back when I was 8 or 9 years old. That was how I was first introduced to Toy Story. The movie was very touching and emotional. Listening to the developers' talking about how they made the movie and hearing the various reviews from many people about Toy Story was nice. I loved how Andy (and don't forget Buzz) never gave up throughout the movie, acting like most people in the world generally do (showing that toys are much like us), whether for the good or bad. I liked how the both helped each other and worked together in the movie. It was a great experience and I recommend that you who haven't watched it should. In the end, both realized their mistakes, admitted them and changed to become better persons. Sorry, toys. Good and groundbreaking; Good and groundbreaking computer animation graphics movie that delivers but does not reach a higher level due to the animation itself not having the \"warmth\" of the drawing style classic Disney animations.Still,the computer style here is very promising and quite impressive.Good story and script.A good solid start in a new trend in animation production.Very good voice acting.Only for fans of kids movies..... The greatest animation ever made.; This film amazed me it has one of the greatest scripts ever made it's lines are among the most memorable even though the two stars never met each other while filming was taking place and it brings together a fantastic cast including Tim Allen and Tom Hanks and an amazing supporting cast. The animation is completely perfect and the fact that it doesn't let itself be rolled into Disney Schmaltz too bad is another plus. a fantastic film with an unbelievably great script a real masterpiece and a great role model for other films too follow and a fantastic start for that studios career which has also continued with Monsters Inc and A bugs life if you haven't already got it go out and buy it. 5 out of 5 stars One of the Top Ten Movies of the 1990s; If there's any justice in this crazy world of ours, \"Toy Story\" will become a classic in the mode of \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Snow White.\" I look forward to its appearing every year on television, as a much anticipated \"event.\" It certainly is groundbreaking, what with imagery that must've taken a computer system dwarfing the pentagon's to do. But I love how well-thought-out this movie is. The plot works from beginning to end. The performances are terrific--Tom Hanks and Tim Allen don't just blather their lines onto the soundtrack, leaving it for the animators to do all the work. No, rather, they're really *acting* here, imbuing their characters with as much depth and breadth as if they'd been playing flesh-and-blood people. Keep a sharp eye, movie lovers, inside gags abound: When Woody runs from an escaped globe, you'll think it looks just like the giant ball sequence from \"Raiders,\" and you'll be right! When Buzz walks amid a sea of tiny alien squeak-toys, Richard Dreyfuss' close encounter \"...of the Third Kind,\" of course, should echo in your mind. The look of the movie *is* stunning--and, IMO, it \"works\" in every instance but one: Syd's dog. Instead of looking canine, he looks instead like a fur-covered football. I wish Pixar had spent a few more pixels refining his \"look.\" But all that's quibbling. Here's a movie for every kid who whiled away an afternoon while sprawled in front of a toy box and for every adult who ever wondered what happens to those Little Tykes people once you turn off the lights and go to bed... A resounding success; Pixar knocks it out of the park with its first feature film, about friendship, jealousy and the capriciousness of privileged white kids in a society of disposability. A clever, sharp and imaginative screenplay expertly voiced by a stellar cast (I would give this 5/10 just for casting Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head) keeps the swiftly moving story engaging throughout, flagging only a bit when self- deluded toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is briefly depressed. The film hops from one great set-piece to the next with head-spinning speed that leaves me marveling at how simple director John Lasseter and the team of animators make it look to bring these toys to life with just a few touches of individuality. Every viewer will probably have their favorite parts. Back when I first saw the movie upon its initial release, mine was the new-age toys who worship the Claw; upon recent viewing, I think it is \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" rendition of evil neighbor Sid's bedroom. It's hard to remember now that Pixar has proved so successful that there was real doubt about whether its style of computer-graphics animation would be embraced by audiences -- kudos to Pixar for proving the doubters wrong. Toy Story 1; I have to give Toy Story 1 an 8 b/c even though I am a grown adult, I love all types of Disney movies but this one nearly tops the charts. Toy Story 2 on the other hand gets a 2, it was the most boring movie there ever was... actually kind of depressing to. Granted Toy Story 1 was extremely good it's just not a movie they should have came out with a sequel to. I am currently searching for pictures (scenes) from the movie because of my screen name I would like to find pictures of buzz with the pink hat on portraying Misses Nesbit. If anyone has these pictures could you please reply? I also believe that Toy Story 1 was the best movie because of the cool graphic's. I think that Disney done an exceptional job on the movie in parts where the Pizza Planet scene was taken because of the reality of the crane machine and the little green aliens. Also the kids in the scenes looked very real to, even though I think the mother of Andy had way to much animation in it. fun; I love the movie toy story because it is fun and a good movie. I love the movie because woody found out there was going to be another toy for Andy and he was getting jealous. When woody saw the new toy he was really jealous because the other toys likes buzz and not woody. Woody wanted to get rid of buzz but getting to the end he regrets what he did to buzz and he went to save buzz and wanted to be friends with him. When the other toys ask for buzz woody always had an excuse and his friends found out that he wanted to rid of buzz so all his friends was really mad at buzz. His friends tried to find buzz. They found buzz in a pizza place where they had arcades and other stuff. When they found buzz woody apologized buzz and he wanted to be friends and be OK with everything. This Movie is Great!!; Toy Story was the best Pixar movie i ever watched! It has a good start where Andy has a birthday with his favourite toy: Woody. And Andy's Mom says \"Go Get Molly, the party is about to start!\" So Andy runs to his Room to get Molly. Woody realized he was not Andy's favourite toy anymore, So Woody wants to be Andy's favourite toy again! Woody had to find a way to knock Buzz out of the house, And Andy bringing Woody to Pizza Planet! So Woody was fighting Buzz, He realized he was a lost toy. So Woody Found A Pizza Car with a Spaceship on the top! So Buzz finds a Spaceship Claw Machine. Buzz found Alien toys in the Machine! The Aliens found The Claw! So Sid tries to get Buzz, But he got double prizes!! The Ending was great!! The ending had Andy moving in a new house, Then getting new stuff for Christmas, Then Woody And Buzz seemed happy at each other! rather clever; Great Pixar movie. I love the idea and the point to this animated feature. It's so good in so many ways. I remember it came out in theaters when I was three and wanted to see it so badly I couldn't sleep for weeks. This movie has been out for over ten years and I still enjoy it today as a teenager. It's great for all ages and brings so many laughs to a lot of young and older people. I especially love the part when Buzz Lightyear is in denial and thinks he is Mrs. Nizbet. That was SOOOOOOOOO funny!!!!!!!!! LMAO!!!!!!!!!! This movie is always going to be remembered for so long. Even the sequel was really good. I'm gonna have to post a comment on that on too. Anyways great movie. Loud laughs for everyone. My Favorite Animated Film EVER; I love Toy Story. Plain and simple, it's a phenomenal film. Not only is it one of the most well-made animated films ever made, it's also one of my favorite films in general. It's incredibly appealing story, the voice acting is perfect, the characters are very likable and fun to watch on screen, and the animation is stellar for it's time. The basic premise of TOY STORY is life seen through the eyes of a toy. The film centers around the toys belonging to a boy named Andy, particularly following his favorite toy, a stuffed cowboy doll named Woody. Woody is primarily the one in charge of Andy's room, but his authority is threatened when Andy gets a new spaceman toy named Buzz Lightyear. The only problem is that Buzz doesn't know he's a toy. He genuinely thinks that he is a real space ranger. Tom Hanks voices Woody and Tim Allen voices Buzz, and both do a stellar job. I couldn't ever imagine anybody voicing these two characters besides Hanks and Allen. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well, such as Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, and others. The characters are so fun to watch, and you truly care about them as you watch Woody and Buzz form a friendship. At it's heart, Toy Story is a buddy movie, and one of the best made at that. While the animation seems somewhat dated today when compared to PIXAR's more recent films, the film does still look very nice. Looking back at the film, it truly is a technological achievement as well as a film-making achievement in general. Being the first animated film done entirely through computers, Toy Story had a lot of expectations to meet. And not only does it meet expectations, it surpasses them to infinity and beyond. This Is A Great Family Movie; Imagine a world where whenever your back is turned or whenever you leave a room your toys come to life and communicate with each other like we do. Woody is the toy cowboy doll of a boy called Andy. Woody is Andys favorite toy until one day Andys birthday comes around and he gets a new toy which quickly becomes Andys favourite toy ahead of Woody. Woody quickly becomes jealous because not only has Andy pushed him aside but his fellow toy friends have chosen the new toy Buzz Lightyear ahead of Woody so now Woody plots a way to get Buzz out of the way for good with disastrous consequences. I will say no more about the movie as i feel if you haven't seen it then most of this film should be a surprise to you. All i do have to say however is Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz are superb choices as the voices of the main characters. This is an incredibly warm hearted and fun family film that a child of any age would love. Wonderful animated feature...; TOY STORY is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. It goes along with TOY STORY 2, TARZAN, A BUG'S LIFE, THE LION KING and CHICKEN RUN as some of my favorite animated features. Tom Hank s voices Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll owned by a boy named Andy who is the most-played toy until a space ranger, Buzz (Tim Allen) comes along and Woody is not good friends with them. But one day later, a mean toy-hating man who owns a collection of mutant toys and tries to threaten Buzz, and it is up to Woody to save Buzz with the help of the mutants before it's too late to escape to Andy's new house. The sequel is better than the original, but TOY STORY is a good movie. **** Cool A MUST see; I saw this movie when i was 5 years old a long time ago and I was so obsessed with Buzz Lightyear! I had toys of buzz Lightyear and carried them around anywhere i went.I saw this movie yesterday again and it was fabulous! plain fabulous. The story was amazing and the characters were well made! Nice job Pixar, You done it again! Tom Hanks did well doing a voice of Woody and same with Tim Allen with Buzz. I didn't really like Wall.E i almost fell asleep but this movie kept me awake the whole time with excitement! I recommend this movie to anyone no matter what age you are because this movie Just Beautiful! An fantastic awesome 10/10 The recent 3-D version of Toy Story just adds to a great experience!; When this initial computer animated movie first came out in November of 1995, I was stoked to watch this especially after watching a little behind the scenes short about it at Walt Disney World and besides, my birthday was near. What a wonderful experience what with the funny moments as well as touching ones and some intense ones concerning that sadistic kid Sid. And the use of many established comic talents like Don Rickles, Annie Potts, John Ratzenberger (who would become a regular Pixar voice), the late Jim Varney, and especially, Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. And as with previous Disney animated features, Randy Newman provides such an enjoyably compelling music score as well as several enjoyable songs with a great theme song in \"You've Got a Friend in Me\" that he warbled with Lyle Lovett. And the recent 3-D version just adds to the experience! So while this and Toy Story 2 is still (in its fourth week) playing as a double feature in theatres (with an entertaining 10-minute intermission of trivia and many other extras), I recommend you rush to the next showing as soon as you can! Greatest childhood memory; This movie reminds me of my childhood. I used to watch this movie almost everyday. This is great for kids and adults as well. I remember my whole family watching this movie. We used to sit together by the t.v. and have some quality family time. That was around the time when everyone seemed so busy with their lives. But this movie brought us all together. We were able to let go of everything and watch this movie. I show this to my baby brother and he loves this series. Whenever I hear the theme song I am brought back to the time of family bonding. When everybody had time for this particular movie. I still enjoy watching this movie at this age. I gave it a ten because it has helped me through so many times, it has been there through so many problems. I loved this movie and would recommend this movie to everyone. This review is to honor the movie the way it deserves to be honored. *This review has been stretched and has been dramatized to make the 10 line requirement. Just know that I really love the movie. That's about it* One of the best children's (and adult!) Disney animation ever created.; Toy Story is and will always be one of the best children's and adult's Disney animation ever created. As a parent, you dread seeing the same animated movies over and over again (kids never get bored seeing the same movie many times), but this one is different. I've lost track how many times I've seen it and it's just as enjoyable as the first time I saw it. Tom Hanks' voice is perfect for Woody, as is Tim Allen's as Buzz Lightyear and Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head. Love this movie and I don't think I will ever get bored seeing it. It's a perfect 10/10 from me. One of the Best Animated Films Ever!; Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen.  The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer.  The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen.  The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year).  Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with. The masterpiece that started it all; I remember seeing Toy Story opening night in 1995. 5 years have passed since then, and this movie is still awesome. I have matured in those years, but this film has not lost it's impact. It's so addictive to watch and so much fun. It has a wonderful voice cast, great animation, and an overall great story. It's a film I will watch for years, and it's one of my favorite modern animation films When toys attack.. or have fun.. or escape..; A classic. I enjoyed this, and the actual toys of Buzz when I was younger, and now I just rewatched the movie and I'm very glad that I did. Weird, it's almost Halloween, and this is far from horror. Anywho, this is one of the films that got people to know, There's a company named Pixar and they're going to rock the world of film and animation as you know it. This movie could be one of Pixar's best. Andy is moving and his toys are coming with him. But he gets a new toy for his birthday, but a week before since he wants to have his party before he move. His new toy.. Buzz Lightyear! And Woody is jealous because he could not be the favorite toy. But before you know it, Woody is lost on the way to a Pizza place when he was supposed to be going with Andy, and Buzz is joining on the ride. Now they must get to Andy before he moves.. or while he's moving. Oops, spoiled. A great animation. Really shows you why some choose 3d animation over traditional animation. Hey, you wouldn't want to see toy story as a 2d cartoon? Do you?  This movie was one of the best 3d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an 8.5.(I gave it an 8) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of 3d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! One of the most watchable(& re-watchable) movies ever.; This movie has it all. Simple enough for children to enjoy, and yet with enough subtle humour for adults to enjoy as well. In fact, this film was made more for adults than for children I suspect-much of the humour is subtle and adult oriented, and as the makers admit, many of the toys are ones they played with in their childhoods. The toys in the film are actually better actors, and convey more emotion, than most \"actors\" in films today. Kudos to Pixar for an excellent job. A must-see film, it has something for everyone, and loses nothing on repeated viewing. I saw it 3 times at the cinema, and then bought it on video, and have probably seen it 50 or so times at home, and yet it is still funny, and I will happily watch it again.  My childhood!; I love this film. It has a few flaws. It doesn't look nearly as well as it did upon release. But I'll never forget watching this classic in the cinema. Pixar had a solid group of films dating over a decade (Cars not included), but I can always re-visit. Thanks Pixar for this brilliant premiere of a gem and for: - A Bug's Life - Monsters, Inc. - Toy Story 2 - Finding Nemo - The Incredibles - Ratatouille - WALL-e - Up - Toy Story 3 Yep! a wonderfully innovative movie; truly a delight; Clever, heartwarming story centers around a group of living toys and their perspectives on the world they inhabit, one in which attention from their owner is the essence of their very existence. An old-fashioned cowboy doll and longtime favorite of his child owner is threatened by the arrival of a sophisticated, high-tech space ranger. Despite their differences, they eventually realize that they need each other in order to overcome a dangerous predicament. On the surface it's the first film ever done completely with computer animation, but at its heart is a compelling story of friendship, love, and acceptance. Terrific songs, remarkable animation, and a perfect cast of voices make this an engaging experience for all ages. A family film and so much more. ***½ Toy Story 9/10, Toy Story 3-D 5/10- rip off; Let me explain. I love films. Toy Story is beyond excellent. Toy Story 3-D is perhaps the biggest con since Keyser Soze convinced the world he didn't exist. There is ONE SCENE in the whole film where you actually get the sense of 3-D and that is right at the end during a snow scene. If you have Toy Story on DVD or have seen it before, stay at home because you are seeing nothing new here. The thing that annoys me is that in addition to paying to see the same film that I own on DVD, I paid extra for 3-D glasses!! unbelievable!! it should've been a highway mans mask and a club. I implore you to stay away from this and Toy Story 2 3-D when it is out as I am sure they will just do the same again. Hands Down My Favorite Disney FIlm.; I just recently saw the Toy Story, Toy Story 2 double feature and it was amazing seeing this movie on the big screen after all this time. In my opinion this is the best movie Pixar has made so far, and it will be hard to top it. The animation is flawless and all of the characters are so lovable, you actually forgot that they are toys and not real people. The plot is actually really inventive and the idea of toys being jealous of one another is really fun. I think this movie is perfect for people of any age because the humor can be enjoyed by anyone. Obviously it's the perfect movie for kids, but it's great for adults too. Tim Allen and Tom Hanks lend their voices as the main characters in this film, and they are perfect in it. Overall, this movie is genuine animated classic! Created a decade ago, but still stunning; I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago. The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their \"leader\" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other... When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10. Hanks and Allen are hilarious even animated!; As if Tom Hanks wasn't talented enough...someone had the brilliant idea to animate him! Not to mention pair Hanks great sense of humor with comedic genius Tim Allen! Together, these two keep the giggles and laughs coming in this cute and successful Disney Pixar flick that spawned an even cuter sequal! Best Animated Film Ever!!!!; This is one of the best animated films I ever seen! It will always be better than the other two Toy Story films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are so good in the Toy Story franchise. Woody's sarcasm is the best part of the film as well as Buzz not knowing he's a toy. The story of this film is just something you wouldn't expect but then it is about toys, so it all makes sense. I will always recommend this film and the rest of the franchise to friends and family. To Infinity and Beyond! My favorite film as a kid and remains a classic today; As a kid, I remember watching the first two Toy Story films frequently and collecting all the characters from the movie. I found out that it was the very first computer-animated film about two years ago and assumed that's why the movie is still so popular. Woody and Buzz are what made the film what it was then and today and were my favorite characters. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is where Woody and Buzz are launched in the air from the rocket and Buzz frees himself to fly into Andy's toy box. The film remains a classic and always will be to me. I also cannot wait for the third movie to come out June 18, 2010 because I'll be the first in line. The film of a child's dream; All I can say is that I started my childhood with this film. And I can remember that my hole day i was thinking of the film in the clouds I could picture the film, in my dream i kept thinking of it. I say that this film completed a kids dream. And in the future I will surly show this film to my kids and if they didn't like it ..... well they must like it!!!! I started to learn English after I sow this film. And every time I remember my childhood and this film I could cry. So I am asking you to watch this movie and please make your kids watch it with you. And I really want a third film for toy story. And thanks for the producers for doing two parts of this film. If ever a movie was perfect, this is it.; Never mind that it's a kiddie movie.  It's a pioneer film from Walt Disney and worth seeing just on that merit alone.  The whole concept of the toys lends itself perfectly to the new medium of computer animation, not to mention the incredible marketing of it's toys. The plot and the dialogue keep producing laughter faster than Disney's releases of re-releases.  The end sequence ties in perfect with the open sequence, opening presents.  In fact, the whole concept was so solid, that the movie would have been just as successful if no big names had been cast.  Not that I'm complaining, I'm a fan of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, too.  But when you look  back at all the hoopla of the film, you kind of forget them.  You won't forget Buzz and Woody! Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition); Tom Hanks is an amazing animated movie with a well written script that is about the secret life of toys. The centers around Andy and his toys. Andy has a long time favorite toy named woody. Woody likes his situation till Andy gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear and Woodys situation changes forever, or so it seems to Woody. The animation is astounding considering that it was done over ten years ago (1995). I highly recommend this movie and I consider it one of the best animated made ever. The songs are a bit sappy but perfect for animated movies and the music is right on par. I definitely without a doubt give this movie 5 stars. Toy Story is the greatest Disney movie ever in my opinion! Looking forward to Toy Story 3 in two years!; There is absolutely no question about it, Disney/Pixar's 1995 hit film, Toy Story, is their absolutely best film in my opinion. Pixar, the visual effects studio based in Northern California, was best known for making short films with three dimensional technology, including some Oscar winning shorts. In 1992 a script called Toy Story was completed and Pixar decided to take on the challenge of creating the world's first fully computer animated motion picture. In 1995, that script came to life, and the rest is history. Not only was Toy Story a gigantic hit for Disney and Pixar, it started series of films that continues to amaze and bewilder children and adults of all ages. The animation was state of the art, and continues to look amazing to this day. The characters, Woody, and Buzz Lightyear, to the humor were all amazing. Pixar won a special Oscar for making the first computer animated film, and it led to many more films of it's type to this day. Pixar, don't make us wait, please give millions of children around the world what we desperately need, more adventures of Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Here's to many more Toy Story films in the future, including the upcoming Toy Story 3 coming in three years, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen returning as Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Bona Fide Genius; What can I say that has not been said about this superb piece of work? Pixar have redefined what animation is all about. The concept, the story, the writing and the voice-overs could hardly be bettered. The toys are real individual characters brought to believable life by the actors who voice them. Special mention for Tom Hanks as you really cannot separate his voice from Woody's character. It works on every level. Kids love it, as do teenagers, young adults and pensioners like me too. The songs by Randy Newman are not too intrusive and actually enhance the story and move it on too. The amount of work that must have gone into the brainstorming before production started must have been amazing. It would have been great to have an insight into all that. Everyone should be made to watch this - it has a lot to say about life and relationships. Best computer animated movie of it's time!; This is an all time classic movie. The characters can really hold the your attention. The bright colors are wonderful. There is never a dull moment in this film especially with Woody. The toy characters are so great an funny. I love the banter between Mr & Mrs Potato Head. Buzz Lightyear is also an awesome character who is very courageous! This is a fantastic film I am a really big fan of Tom Hanks! A Toy in the making of another and more toys; Excellent voice match to character in movie. Could have more art and less same images repeat. Pixar is now faster than ever; 1995 a slower speed for animated film. Will watch again, but not over and over again, consecutively. Liked it on Facebook, happy go lucky and not afraid to be bold. Don't understand the likes and dislikes but willing to accept all criticism. My own personal review may be liked or may be disliked. The clearness and accurate manner for beautiful taste in dual role models for example Sid the evil kid whom abuses toys and Andy the kid who doesn't like to play rough. However, Sid's sister is quite an opposite to Sid as well; she being a girl and has a love for tea parties with her closest doll Friends. The jokes and laughter in \"Toy Story\" is what made this turn of a century animated film a door-buster into the the first \"digital\" animated films in history. Of course, one does grow old and the story is great passed on to your children in just about any house hold! this movie is awesome!the humor never bores!; i remember when this movie came out in 1995. i was seven at the time. i have loved it since day 1. actors such as tom hanks and tim allen bring sparkle to the show. they are both hillarious as woody and buzz. this movie is directed at both kids and adults. the humor never goes flat and it is never cheesy or corny. if you are a fan of tom hanks and tim allen or you just want a good laugh, than you shoud definitely watch this movie. you will not regret it. ********** out of **********. Not to be missed!!!!; This is probably the best effort Disney has ever put into a movie and it shows! The animation can not be faulted (I even noticed reflections in polished wood tables when the toys walk across them!) the attention to detail in this digital world was brilliant. The characters were hilarious and I still laugh in all the same places after multiple viewings. It's a movie about friendship and doing the right thing after you make a mistake. A valuable lesson for young children. The jokes for adults are spot on aswell such as the quick \"Blink and you'll miss it\" scene where Mr Potatohead mocks another toy by taking his mouth off and patting his rear end with it. The word \"A##kisser!\" immediately came to mind and I laughed for ages at that alone! It was also subtle enough for young children watching to miss it altogether which shows how cleverly this movie was put together. Can't wait for the sequel! 10/10 even better than Bug's Life (another Disney / Pixar collaboration) and that's high praise indeed!  The one that started it all; Toy Story is a gem of a movie from Pixar that is still as visually impressive today as it was when it was originally released over a decade ago. Computer animation was a new thing at the time but Toy Story proved that the medium was more than a novelty act and was going to be around for a while. Woody (Tom Hanks) is Andy's favorite toy until Buzz Lightyear, a spaceman voiced by Tim Allen, arrives on the scene. To quote Randy Newman's song from the film, strange things begin to happen to Woody when he loses popularity with the other toys and is accused of trying to kill Buzz out of jealousy. Soon things go awry for the toys when Sid, Andy's sadistic neighbor, gets a hold of Woody and Buzz. The toys have to learn to work together and forge an alliance in order to survive. Great story and voice acting all around makes Toy Story a classic. 9 out of 10. Mesmerized..; When I first watched the film, I was in love with movies. This is one of those films that one can watch again and again. All things apart, the most dazzling part of the film are its story. And when you mix it with mind blowing dialog delivery (voice over), then you serve an exceptional beauty for anime lovers. The voice over of woody by Tom hanks is the best that I have ever heard in any animation film. The story is the best in so many of the animation films till today. There is nothing in the film that you might dislike. The toy story series serves the true purpose of films which is to make people forget about their day to day worries. The characters in the film are an absolute delight to watch. Each and every character is designed so nicely with their respective roles that I am in love with the series. The essence of the film is simple and has been conveyed in an easy way. Looking forward for more films like these. \"A must watch for everyone, and especially kids.\" a movie that you will be talking about; this is a movie that you will be talking about i never saw a movie like this ever Toy Story is one amazing movie this is a movie that everyone will be talking about if you like Toy Story 2 and 3 than you you will like the first one it is a laugh out laud movie i never saw a movie like this ever it is outstanding it is a sweet movie go see this amazing movie today i never saw a movie quite like this ever it is like a dream come true this is the perfect family film it is a great movie for the kids to enjoy even if your kids are 13 14 15 16 17 18 or 19 they will still enjoy this amazing movie go see this 4 out of 4 star movie and a two thumbs up movie it is that good of a movie you have to go see Toy Story it is a must see for everyone it is a hoot there is nothing like this movie i am serious there is nothing like this movie it is one of a kind it is the best movie ever created i think so it is hilarious i laugh so hard it was that funny it should be called the number 1 movie in the world have a great day everyone Scmaltz-tastic 3D adventure ride falls a little flat over the years; I just watched Toy Story for only the 3rd time since it was first in the theaters, and as much as I liked a lot of the movie, it fizzles out over time for me. It's a very cute movie, mainly for kids, but it has a few chuckles thrown in for adults. The human characters in the movie didn't seem very realistic; their happy-go-lucky, suburban lifestyle just made them very flat and barely likable, especially if you grew up in a family unable to afford multiple toys. The voice actors were delightful, and their moods were directed very well, even for the plastic Army-men who don't show much emotion. The \"cannibal toys\" were very imaginative and creepy, so they served their purpose well. I thought the idea of the claw machine that housed the little green aliens was cute, how \"The Claw\" was their Messiah of sorts. The coloring in the film was vivid and incorporated some awesome day-glow tones that I had forgotten about over time. The ultimate reason to watch the movie is to witness Pixar's astounding use of 3D imagery, especially when they incorporate real-life effects onto the screen (i.e. The magnifying lens over Woody's face). There were some aspects of the film I didn't care for. The movie is only 77 minutes long without the prefaced, short 3D movie before it, making the story suffer and seem a little lacking. I found the music to be over-the-top schmaltzy and generic, but it is primarily for kids and the Disney crowd, so I guess it belongs here. Again, the character of Andy isn't very likable, other than the fact that he owns a lot of older toys that we made have seen commercials of as a kid. The story wasn't very mind-blowing, but from the vantage point of a toy on the run, it is imaginative enough. It's the typical Indiana Jones setting where the main characters always find a way to turn their two-steps forward into one-step back. The ending with the falling through the sunroof was very convenient and could've easily been the start of another obstacle they needed to face, for example. In the end, I like the movie for its presentation, but as a film, I was not blown away with originality or anything by its story. The messages that it sends about jealousy, envy, depression, fear, and questions about one's worthiness to another are the primary focuses throughout the movie, but it ends up just being another nicely tied-up package in the end, which is Disney for you. 5 stars. Perfect! A badge to be worn proudly by Pixar.; Of course my opinion, but truly,honestly perfect! It is an amazing standalone, kid, and Pixar film with all the great motifs of all. It teaches children good values about who are in the world, and mortality. It also appeals to all ages and has incredible animation for 1995, and also was great enough to be unforgotten all the way until now 2015, 20 years later. Buzz's realization that he is just another product to be sold in the world, is in my opinion, one of the greatest moments of movie and entertainment history. The movie gives you a lot of things to speculate on like is Woody a bad toy? Or can a movie have virtually no villain but the hero or at all? The choice is 100% yours and that is what I love most about the movie. It is absolutely timeless and unforgettable and I highly suggest watching it. Super family movie!; Toy Story is truly a pioneer of this type of movie. I don't know what it's really called but I think digital animation best describes it. From here, you have all the Shrek, etc. derivatives. Not only is the film irresistibly funny it is also has a clever story and unlike many movies of today you can watch this one over and over. The voices are done by a host of popular names that we all know and love. Some of the most popular being Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, and John Ratzenberger as Hamm. Jim Varney even lends his hilarious voice as Slinky the Dog. The story is about a boy (Andy) that gets a new toy (Buzz Lightyear) for his birthday. Andy's previous favorite toy (Woody) feels forgotten. After a series of mis-adventures the two find themselves away from the home and must learn to work together to find their way back. The film is followed by a sequel \"Toy Story 2\" and \"Toy Story 3\" which were just as awesome, if not more so than this one. 9/10 easily The cartoon that started it all.; I am not a kid but a kid at heart. Toy Story is one of the best animated movies around. This is the most creative movie for kids and adults. Toy Story 2 is better story than the first one, but equally imaginative in computer graphics. \"I'm not really from Mattel...I'm from a smaller company purchased in a leveraged buyout.\"; A kid's bedroom full of toys comes to life when humans aren't around; each toy, both new and retro-vintage, has his or her own individual personality, and they're all thrilled to meet the new member of the pack, birthday present Buzz Lightyear, who just may usurp Sheriff Woody in their pre-teen owner's heart. Disney/Pixar computer-generated cartoon has witty writing and incredible visuals to spare, though some scenes are heavy with chatter and the climactic race to catch up to a moving van is stretching things, even for a kid's picture. Still, some of the lines (which fly by at top speed) are very sharp and funny, and the star-voices (particularly Tim Allen's as Buzz) are uncanny. **1/2 from **** Entertaining for all; Cleverly crafted Disney production has plenty to laugh at for both younger and more mature audiences. The innovative idea creates a world in which children's toys come to life in their own universe; the bedroom. While the animation is not exactly state of the art any more, the pic benefits from some jovial, whole-hearted performances. Especially of note is the irrepressible Tom hanks as Woody, Andy's favourite toy (until now), and Tim Allen, hilariously deadpan as space ranger Buzz Lightyear, the new guy in town. The comedy stays fresh and lively throughout while there is always something happening to keep little eyes tuned. Infinitely watchable, as Disney often is. Tuesday, December 1, 1998 - Video Imaginative Breakthrough.; Toy Story (1995): Dir: John Lasseter / Voices: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Jim Varney: Breakthrough first fully computer animated film and what a wondrous triumphant visual thrill it is. It is a film for families that will appeal on different grounds depending on age. It regards a cowboy named Woody and the jealousy that erupts when Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear enters the room on their owner's birthday. Buzz is interesting because he doesn't realize that he is a toy. When Woody causes Buzz to fall out a window an adventure begins that eventually lands them both in nasty Sid's bedroom from next door where a dire fate awaits toys. Grand idea with imaginative filmmaking by director John Lasseter. Where the film goes wrong is its placing supporting characters as types with little purpose. The two leads carry the film with Tom Hanks voicing Woody who goes from important to jealousy to hero in an exciting climax. Tim Allen as Buzz brings much humour in his inability to accept what he is. There is a host of other toys that seem more like fillers. Don Rickles voices Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn voices T-Rex. Jim Varney of Ernest P. Worrell fame voices the loyal Slinky Dog. It contains a theme of love and friendship and for adults it addresses the future of films. Grand achievement, or as the toys put it, \"To infinity and beyond!\" Score: 9 / 10 A fantastic family film.; The plot:A wooden cowboy doll called Woody is a young boy's favourite toy, yet when his owner gets a space toy of an astronaut called Buzz Lightyear, Woody has been left out of his owner's daily live. Woody finds out that Buzz Lightyear thinks that he really is a space ranger.     Both toys are now fighting each other while being kidnaped by the next door nieghbour that hates toys and must work together to get back to their owner before they are destroyed. The view:A wonderful enchanting and nicely funny story about rivally between two toys that are animated very well, with the fact of the movie being the first that was computer animated, this movie is really for everyone that enjoys watching a film that the whole family will delight in. Great fun. **** Timeless; Here's another film I watched back-to-back every day for a couple of weeks, when I was younger. I recently picked up the DVD and was instantly pulled in again. I ended up watching it again two days later. Anyway, I must point out that watching it when you're a child and watching it when you're an adult will result in two different experiences. Watching it recently I laughed my arse off at jokes I didn't even know were jokes back then; even simple things like \"Buzz LightBeer\" can have quite an impact. Alright then, enough of that. The film is 100% perfect the way it is. The characters are so full of personality, so full of humanity, and how it perfectly expresses emotions of loneliness, rejection, and love through a couple of toys is astounding. The movie has a sort of episodic appeal to it, wherein each episode leads to one collective end. It also seems that the worst that can happen to our protagonists does happen. It makes for one unpredictable plot. There's plenty of darkness here, especially with the whole Sid scenario, or when Buzz tries to fly. Did I mention the soundtrack? Randy Newman was perfect for this job; the music has a childish aura to it, but also helps accentuate the emotions of certain scenes. Can't imagine why he wasn't asked to work on the sequel. Anyway, Toy Story has received countless awards, and it is my opinion they are deserved. The Best Kids Movie of the 90's; Despite being the first full-length computer-animated movie, the movie's strengths are its plot and characterization.  The technology is not thrust in your face and simply serves to support a truly excellent animated film. A classic. Proof that Pixar not only cares about the quality of their work,they care about our kids.; Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library. my Personal Favorite of Pixar's Work; I remember seeing this film at the ripe age of seven, and I was totally entranced by it. What kid would not have been attracted to that sweet of a premise? Released way back in 1999, it was totally different from the usual hand drawn animation, and yet still as vibrant, if not more so. Even now as an 18 year old dude I find it so amazing. Attention to detail has always been Lasseter's strong suit, among many I might add. But the greatest thing about this film was the life evoked into its unique and untouchable characters. With the voice talents of Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, as well as the hilarious Don Rickles, and the late Jim Varney, the voice acting was perfect and the dialogue was surprisingly intelligent throughout. What could be perceived more or less as a simple story is told with heart and humor, one that hasn't aged a bit since that first viewing. I still own my original VHS copy in fact, but perhaps it's time I buy it on Blu-ray or DVD. Cynical and disturbing; This is one film that left me with a very sour aftertaste.  Yes, it's animated with character and vigour, and there are some fine -- if over the top -- voice performances.  However, there are some very disturbing aspects to the film.  The first is that it's like nothing so much as watching a 90 minute advert.  Even if merchandising hadn't been released to support the film, all the supporting cast could already by bought in your local toy shop.  I'm sure I wasn't the only viewer who found this more than a little suspect. Possible spoiler: The second, perhaps larger, point against the film lies in the characterisation of the two boys, Andy and Sid.  Andy is the \"good\" boy. He plays safely and passively with his toys, they don't do anything toys wouldn't do.  Sid, the \"bad\" boy is more creative.  He adapts toys to fit his own vision, he's an innovator, a creator.  It's this very creativity of his that is portrayed as a bad thing.  Sid isn't the ideal target audience for this film: he wouldn't be satisfied with row after row of identical shop-bought toys, he would much rather make his own.  I guess this review is being written for all the Sids out there, who are demonised and vilified by this ultra-corporate nightmare of a film. You've got a friend in me; \"Reach for the sky\"! The opening statement of Woody (Hanks) a toy cowboy during a boys playtime. A statement that proves to be ironic when he later looks up at a toy from space, Buzz Lightyear (Allen). Woody's owner is growing older and Woody struggles to accept the change as Buzz becomes Andy's new favourite toy. Leading from the once strong leader into a bout of jealousy and even malice as he tries to take Buzz out of the picture. Woody is then separated from Andy via a fight with Buzz and has to find a way home. Further change occurs as Woody is forced to align with Buzz to escape the toy antagonist Sid. It takes 3/4 of the movie for Woody to finally change his ways, and work with Buzz for the final great escape. Woody's journey from leader to outcast to redemption is intriguing to watch unfold. His final monologue with Sid was beautifully written as the toy out wits the boy. The whole irony of his story is that a child's mind is fleeting and 10 minutes of playing with Buzz and Woody would have been in the game again. For me it is Buzz that follows the greater path of change. Noble and confident throughout mostly due to being under the illusion he is an actual space ranger. Kudos to the writer who decided to take a toy from this world and make him believe he is real! Simple but incredibly compelling. Buzz's final realisation that he is a toy is arm breaking for him but heartbreaking for us. For a family movie Buzz's breakdown is surprising and well delivered and the journey back to being he hero has Buzz literally \"Reaching for the sky\". With us the viewers figuratively as we are up there with them cheering the final events. Woody and Buzz's journey home is supported by a cast of toys, each with a filled out personality. Loyal Slinky being one of my favourites, always reluctant to turn on his buddy Woody like the others. It's the direction of John Lasseter that puts us into this world. When Woody shouts \"You are a toy\". It's John speaking to us. From the beginning the camera is at ground level. We are not supposed to be a child watching his toys come to life but an actual toy, low level shots panning up throughout give a feel to the vastness of a toys world. We are right there through each playtime, adventure, triumph and failure and by the end Buzz may be flying but we are falling for these toys, in style. The story and characters are a success but the triumph is the medium in which the story is told. Through 3d animation, never before seen feature length. The Pixar animators made a bedroom and a pizza planet truly realistic. They brought toys to life in movement and texture. But most astonishing of all, they made us care for a bunch of 3d shapes put together through countless hours of rendering in a computer. The result is a metaphor for change, not just in the story itself and it's characters but in the medium it is told. The great change from 2d to 3d animation which is now common place for feature animation. This movie is a game changer for cinema and animation alike. Walt Disney and co did it in 1938. 54 years later John Lasseter and co did it again. The possibilities for 3d animation in film are Infinite, and Beyond...? Another Childhood Favorite!!!; I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since. It has a great storyline. Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, and many more. On Andy's Birthday, he receives a Buzz Lightyear action hero, and Woody becomes jealous because he isn't Andy's favorite anymore. When Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, his friends want nothing to do with him. On the way to Pizza Planet, Buzz confronts him in the family van, and knocks him outside and the family drive off without them. They go through a lot trying to get back to Andy before they move. When they end up in Sid's room, the kid who tortures toys, Woody and Buzz must work together in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TOY STORY!!! On it's 20th Birthday, Toy Story still soars To Infinity and Beyond!; In 1989, Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help. They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as \"Toy Story\", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about. First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the \"I'm Mrs Nesbitt\" sequence and the \"You Are A Toy\" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies \"You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic \"To Infinity and Beyond\" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history. There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's 81 minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" and \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" hit the right notes by being memorable songs. Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school. Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late 2000s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy 20th Birthday. Absolute perfection!; Hard to believe it but this, one of my all-time favorite movies, is already five years old.  And you know what, it's aged beautifully. Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest animated films of all time.  And not only that but it's also one of the funniest comedies (animated or otherwise) ever written.  I remember when this first came to theaters and everyone came to see the animation.  Don't get me wrong, \"Toy Story\" would still get a solid ten (if only the ratings went to 11) on eye-candy value alone.  However, the thing that gets me watching it over and over is the script. In short, this is the one animated movie that's *almost* more quotable than \"the Breakfast Club\". I can't imagine that there are people out there that haven't yet seen \"Toy Story\", even though I've met a few.  Go watch it, already!  You can thank me later. This movie is *perfect*. Instant Classic; Every company has that one movie that puts them on the map. That is what Toy Story did for Pixar. Toy Story is a cartoon about a little boy's toy collection that is alive when the little boy is not around. His name is Andy and he loves his toys, and they love him back. Woody is a cowboy and is Andy's favorite toy. The toys always get worried every Christmas and birthday because they fear they will be replaced by a bigger and better toy. The story starts off with Andy's birthday party and all of the toys are on edge. It turns out that a new toy by the name of Buzz Lightyear challenges Woody as the favorite toy. Buzz comes along, steals a little bit of the spotlight and Woody gets incredibly jealous. Eventually Woody and Buzz get lost and must find their way home and back to Andy before he and his family move away forever. Let's start with the toys. I loved these toys. Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Little Bow Peep, Woody, Buzz, Slink, Ham, and even Etch-a-Sketch are the main toys and each are lovable and different. Rex is hilarious because he is ironic. He is a dinosaur but he is a wimp, and he is my favorite of the toys. I remember watching as a little kid and I was always excited to see Rex on screen. Each character has their individual role. There are also toys every kid can relate with and that make the movie special. For example, the barrel of monkeys, the small soldiers, the etch-a-sketch, and Mr. Potato Head are toys every kid used to play with. The smaller toys aren't really relevant for long but when they are seen in the beginning and end of the movie their impact is huge. One of the major themes in the story is jealousy and the relationship between Woody and Buzz. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the favorite toy. Woody is a cowboy with a pull string that says some catch phrases. The other toys look up to him, he is a hero, and Andy loved him with all his heart. Andy dresses up like a cowboy, has Woody posters, and is obsessed with this toy. Woody embraces the love; it defines him, gives him confidence, and confirms that he is the leader. Then Buzz Lightyear comes into the picture with his better quality of a toy. He doesn't have a pull string, but a button Andy presses to have a better sound quality voice box will speak catch phrases. He is made of plastic, which is more durable and he has wings pop out which can simulate flight. Woody becomes incredibly jealous of Buzz and fights for Andy's love. He eventually knocks him out the window. Toy Story may be a kid's movie but it has an interesting and entertaining premise, especially with its characterization. Woody and Buzz both develop into better and stronger characters. Woody goes from a pompous, jealous, selfish, toy, into a respectable and lovable character. He and Buzz become best friends and inseparable, a little cliché, but it's a movie for families so it's perfect. When Buzz first appeared he thought he was a real \"space ranger.\" He was convinced that he was not a toy, he could really fly, and he had a dangerous \"laser\" which was really a blinking light bulb. He develops and he eventually accepts the fact that he is a toy but he is a \"cool toy.\" He is \"Andy's toy.\" Woody admits his jealousy to Buzz and that becomes a turning point in their relationship. We have our villain in the movie, Sid. This kid is just evil. He is a spoiled kid who \"terrorizes toys, just for fun.\" One scene we the toys in Andy's room watch him as he straps firecrackers to a Commander Carl and it explodes. First of all, what kind of nine or ten year old kid plays with explosives? If he isn't nine or ten, what is he doing playing with kid toys? He may tear them apart and put different parts on them, making them scary and horrific for children to even see on screen, that just doesn't make sense. His character fits for a children's movie but in reality a kid like this would never exist in real life. Sid is really my only problem with the movie, but still a character needed for the film. Overall, Toy Story is a classic and put Pixar on the map and was the beginning of a highly successful company. It came out in the 1995 and families everywhere fell in love, including me. It is a movie that can be watched again and again no matter what age. It is a movie kids will show their children when they are older. Teenagers lined up to see Toy Story 3 years later because it meant so much to them back when they were little. Toy Story and its characters left a rare imprint on the hearts of people all over the world. Without a doubt, Toy Story gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and goes down as one of my personal all time favorite animation movies. Toy Story; The story is about toys. The boy who named Andy has toys and enjoys playing with them. To be surprised, their toys can talk and act freely. Nobody of human know the fact. Woody who is Andy's cowboy toy spends a good time, however, Andy's new toy appear for Woddy. The toy's name is Buzz Lightyear. Woody and Buzz fight all the time and loses sight of their family and toys. They tries a lot of ways to meet their family and toys. The film is a long film by Pixar Animation Studious. The genre of the movie is animation, comedy and fantasy. It has dialogue and colors. It has sound effect and it is good to use the way of music. I like the scene that Woody and Buzz success in getting into a car that Andy rides. The film can be enjoyed by only children but also adults. cute; The movie is so cute. The story is about toys. A lot of people had a lot of toys when they were young or they may still have some toys yet. Also, a lot of children have a lot of toys now. Therefore a lot of people can enjoy watching this movie. Not only children but also adult and elder people are interested in the story. There are always a lot of toys around us, so we don't think about toys a lot. \"Toy Story\" indicates toys' feeling. If we use our toys rough, toys may be sad. If we cherish our toys, toys may be happy. By watching this movie, the audience can understand about toys. It is good movie. Children in the movie is young, so people who go to kindergarten or elementary school know how to treat their toys by watching the movie. After watching this movie, I love my toys and I notice that it is important for me. Best Disney ever; Finally a Disney movie which isn't moralistic but just fun to watch. Also it doesn't have the boring \"sing-along-songs\" so this movie is also a perfect movie for anybody about 10 years and (much) older. I really liked the computer-generated graphics because the characters moved very smoothly, something which can't be done the original way. More of these masterpieces in the future please and I will really like Disney at last, but dont't make it to moralistic and musical. That this movie is above all the other Disney -movies in the IMDB top 250 is proof of that. Good, Creative charm for kids and adults!; I'm not a huge fan of animated films, so coming into Toy Story I had very low expectations. At first, I thought it was Meh. Then, as the movie progressed it got better and better. Buzz is funny, Woody is a good cowboy, Sid is awesomely evil. Toy Story has an amazing cast as well. I mean, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, AND the Amazing Don RICKLES as Mr. Potato Head! Toy Story keeps kids and adults on their feet and I'm praising it so much because I have never seen any ANIMATED film as good as Toy Story so far. Disney really worked their magic into this classic. Toy Story FTW. I'm going to go rent Toy Story 2, and see if this film series has advanced even further. Pixar kick ass!; Yap. Those talented people at Pixar shows us that computer animation can be just as alive and creative as drawn animation. People think that the computer \"does all the hard work\", but that's not true. 3D animation can be just as difficult, if not more. The voice talent people are great and the animated characters clicked well with the pre-recorded voices. Everything from the toys' facial expressions to body postures is done well, but the real success of the movie comes from a perfect script. As long as the same creative team sticks around, I wouldn't mind ENDLESS sequels to TOY STORY. Cute Family Movie; Toy Story is a great movie for children and adults. Children will enjoy it simply because it is a cartoon. They will find it exciting because it shows toys coming to life which is something every child pretends with their toys. It's a good movie for children because it teaches them about jealousy, friendship, and teamwork. Adults will appreciate the animation and the accuracy of the details in the toys. Most of the toys used in this film were ones most people had as children. Such as, Mr. Potato head, the slinky dog, etch-a-sketch, and the army men. The theme of Toy Story is friendship. The movies theme song was titled \"You've Got a Friend in Me\". The friendship in this movie is about overlooking insecurities and finding a true friend in someone that you think would be your biggest enemy. A 2001 movie called Monsters Inc. is directed around this same theme. A little girl named Boo should be afraid of the monsters as much as the monsters are afraid of her but they form a friendship that overcomes their differences. Toy Story is about the lives of toys owned by a boy named Andy. Andy is having a birthday and he gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear. Andy's toys worry about him getting new toys because they are afraid they will get lost or donated. With the arrival of Buzz, Woody fills that Andy will like Buzz better. He tries to lose Buzz but instead he accidentally knocks him out of a window. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were brilliantly matched for being the voices of Woody and Buzz Lightyear. The personalities of the actors and characters seemed to be a perfect fit. The other toys in the movie, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky dog (Jim Varney), Pig named Ham(John Ratzenberger), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), and Bo Peep(Annie Potts), feel like Woody did this on purpose because he was jealous of the attention Buzz was getting from Andy. In order to make things right Woody realizes he needs to get Buzz back. Woody and Buzz both wind up separated from Andy and this is where their adventure begins. From this point on they work together to get back to Andy's before his family moves. Along the way Buzz realizes that he is not a space ranger but a toy. Woody tries to help Buzz understand that he is not just a toy and that he is very important to children. Woody convinces Buzz that they must get back to Andy. At the conclusion of the movie, Buzz and Woody are helping each other make it on the moving truck. They finally make it next to Andy who is excited to see both of them. Toy Story is about the friendship that is formed between Woody and Buzz. Once Woody was able to get passed his insecurities he realized that Andy could have two favorite toys. The motif of friendship is displayed throughout the movie by the relationships between Woody and Andy, Woody and all the other toys, and between Woody and Buzz. They also form a friendship with the strange toys at Sid's house. This movie is a true example of friendship. Really Sweet Movie!; Whether you're a fan of animated Disney movies or not, this movie is brilliant! It's great for family time movies or great for the everyday average Disney fan. The characters are put together very well. After I saw it, it made me actually think about throwing out old toys. I've been a fan of this movie ever since I was born(it was really big then) and I still watch it from time to time. I would definitely recommend this to anybody. Still Entertaining after 15 Years; I saw Toy Story in theaters in 95. As a kid it was funny, and original not just in story but in presentation. After 15 years the cg doesn't hold up in all areas. The human characters look stiff and the way background looks a bit flat. This plastic look works with toys so it doesn't become a problem. The movie holds up in every other area. The plot is engaging and the characters funny and likable. Toy Story is a family film it funny for children without talking down to them and enjoyable for adults. As a twenty something year old it is just as entertaining as when I first saw the original release. Fun for all ages; Toy Story is a classic among kids and adults, a classic among animation and simply one of the highest rated movies of all time. At first thoughts I felt yeah sure it is great but then after a little more time I came to realise this is incredible, I won't say it's 100% perfect but still it just exudes this feeling of well, fun. It's the kind of movie that only after do you really understand how Woody feels and how Buzz feels, you also realise how easy it would be to watch it again because it's really a calm but also an exciting watch. It's hard to call this a kid's movie owing to the fact that all fans of this back in the day are fully grown adults now, but the fact that they still return to this and say it is a masterpiece even today, well it shows how impressive this really is as well. The story is of course about toys, and in particular a new toy arriving because Andy the toys owner got a new Space Ranger named Buzz Lightyear for his birthday. Woody the favourite toy of Andy is jealous of Buzz's new found fame among all the other toys and starts to both feel angry but also kind of obsolete as well. The story moves along at a frantic pace, the amount of things that happen though to say this has an 81 minute run time is amazing and the timing is absolutely wonderful. Another point I found only after thinking back on the movie was the humour and how is just really good, one moment in a certain pizza restaurant arcade where we see a \"Whack-a-Alien\" game in reference to \"Alien\" sums up the overly kidult tone this movie possesses. Among the voices we have Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, Don Rickles as a small potato toy, Wallace Shawn in his trademark voice as Rex the dinosaur toy and the smoky voice of Jim Varney as Slinky the well, slinky toy dog. The voices are very memorable and the voice cast are perfectly picked, none seem out of place and maybe that is because of how much this movie has dug itself into film culture. I found Hanks and Allen's voices to be at the same level as each other only because they are both so great, Buzz is made even more courageous sounding by Allen and Hanks provides a kind of cool kind of toy voice but also brings out Woody's scared side or angry side well. John Lasseter the director is among many names behind this movie who seem to all hit the right spot with this, they create the first animated feature length picture and turn it into one of the still most popular of them all. The writers hit the movie from another flank, Lasseter brings humour out from his vision but I think the writers, Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow really bring another face to the movie where the humour but also the emotion can mix really well. As animation goes it of course does not look as it maybe did back then (still isn't bad though), although it doesn't matter anyway because it is the storytelling that blows you away and the characters really grab your attention. Pixar kicked off their stellar works in animated movies in style and brought not only a new way of making a movie, but also a fine way of telling a story and not making it over the top or just for kids, this is for everyone. There isn't too much too find wrong with this I mean, maybe some of the jokes aren't great, but really they may be still good anyway, it is kind of a movie that you can easily watch again without feeling it will quickly become boring, the kind of movie that is fun for quite literally, all the family. Great Fun For Kids And Adults Alike; Toy Story is one of those rare animated movies, designed for children, that adults can enjoy. Plot In A Paragraph: Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) is 8 year old Andy's favourite toy, however his world falls apart when Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) figure for his birthday and he has to play second fiddle to the new space ranger. I loved this movie. Over the years I have watched it with both my kids and nieces and nephews and they have all enjoyed it. Watching it now, it has lost none of its charm. Tom Hanks is superb as Woody, Tim Allen (who I'm not a fan of) is delightful as the deluded Buzz Lightyear who is not aware he is an action figure, but for me the stand out voice was John Ratzenberger as Pork Chop the Piggy Bank. Excellent Viewing, Every Time!; This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too. When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides. The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as \"Woody\" and Allen as \"Buzz Armstrong,\" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc. Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed \"winner\" as is the sequel.  \n",
       "1  A treat for fans of family fantasy fun.; As a child, Alan Parrish becomes trapped inside Jumanji, a magical board game he finds discovers buried in a building site. 26 years later, Judy and Peter Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce), two orphaned kids living with their aunt, discover the game in the attic of their new home and begin to play, freeing the now-grown-up Alan (Robin Williams) in the process. Unfortunately, they also release a host of dangerous animals, deadly plants, and an unstoppable bloodthirsty hunter. Their only hope of survival is to finish the game, whatever the risks. Action packed, funny, heartwarming and even a little scary in places, Jumanji is an excellent family adventure for the whole family, and one that, thankfully, doesn't rely solely on its special effects to impress (a good job, since quite a bit of the CGI is looking rather dated). The story is engaging (with a nice time-travel style twist at the end), the cast is great (with Williams managing to give one of his less irritating performances), and once again director Joe Johnston delivers a final product that, whilst not a classic, is still thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb. A walk in the memory lane; We (me and my brother) used to watch a cartoon named \"Jumanzi\" every Wednesday, back in 2000. Watching this movie talk me through a walk in my memory lane. The great Robin Williams also makes me nostalgic. 26 years, struggling and surviving, and than fighting back to get their life back. It is called human spirit. Though, every bit of it is fantasy, the plot become more human, when Robin remembered his saviors, who give him another chance in the game. Really good movie; Jumanji is a really good movie. I read the book and saw the movie and they are both really good. It got a little weird at times but only a few parts. I liked Robin Williams in this movie. The FX is cool. The monkeys don't really look real. You can tell it was computer generated. Over all it was good. It kept you on the edge of you seat. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good adventure movie for kids. Think of it as Night At The Museum meets a board game; Jumanji is based off a cartoon TV series that was made into a film in 1995 and stars funnyman Robin Williams who plays a man called Alan Parrish who as a kid played a board game called Jumanji which was been buried since 1869 with his friend Sarah(Bonnie Hunt)in the year 1969.But when Alan plays the game he gets sucked into it as his friend Sarah watched in horror as each time the player plays the game consequences occur and the only way to finish the game is to play the whole thing. Fast forward 26 years later in 1995 and two young children played by Kirsten Dunst (from the Spider-Man franchise)and Bradley Pierce who's parents died along time ago are now living with their aunt as their aunt bought Alan's old house.But when the two kids stumble across the board game as they hear the drums playing in the background in the attic,its up to them to try and finish off where the player left off and free Alan who helps them finish the game with his friend Sarah. But will they finish the game. Overall this film is really good until the very end which was sorta confusing for me. If you seen it you know what it is but it involves time travelling back to 1969 and then back to 1995 again. But still if you are a fan of Fantasy movies,Robin Williams and if you love something to keep you entertained on a lazy Sunday afternoon Jumanji is worth checking out. Outrageous fun; When young Alan Parish and his childhood friend, Sarah play a board game that Alan found buried near his fathers business, Alan is sucked into the game and left to grow up alone in the jungle. That is until two young children, Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) join the game and release him 26 years later. Every turn in the game becomes a living nightmare that endangers the lives of everyone involved, and the only way to stop it is finish the game. Alan (Robin Williams) and Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) will have to play some more if there lives are return to normality. The concept of the movie is truly original and it successfully delivers on its potential, with an excellent cast and funny script, this adventure is both hilarious and action packed, with some cool special effects thrown in. Great family entertainment 8/10 A lovely little film; This four year-old film, I would highly recommend for anyone out there in fantasy-land. Nice special effects, a very good idea behind the plot and Robin Williams all ensure a thoroughly enjoyable experience if you like action-comedies without the ubiquitous \"Good vs. Bad\" show-down. Jumanji is very different and well worth seeing. I look forward to the upcoming Jumanji 2 next year;  the cast for Jumanji 2 probably needs to include Gerard Depardieu instead of Robin Williams!!!! :-) Jumanji a great classic movie of the mid 1990's; I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was. The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done. This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too. Probably worth checking out, even today; There is a lot to like in this movie. The concept was intriguing. Robin Williams plays a basic Robin Williams character, i.e. a man-child. I never would have recognized Kirsten Dunst or Laura Bell Bradley as children without the cast list, but they both performed well. David Alan Grier did befuddlement just as well back then as he does now. Bebe Neuwirth and Bonnie Hunt did nicely, and looked very nice as well. The pace got a bit frenetic for me, though I understand that this was deliberate. The CGI animals looked fine in the distance but up close, not so much. I know we are spoiled by the unlimited effects in films today, but some of these, like the lion, looked terrible. I saw in the credits that they had Industrial Light & Magic, so I doubt it could have been done any better at the time. And some of the things in the ending did not seem to totally follow from the body of the film. It's probably worth checking out though, even today. Jumanji  a timeless adventure story; There are few children's movies that I particularly enjoyed  I can recount The Borrowers, Labyrinth and The Neverending Story. Jumanji, however takes a new place among children's films  in fact, it may seem that initially, Jumanji is about simplistic story about kids playing a board game. Based on a gorgeous picture book story of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg, this movie takes a beautiful magical adventure and makes it into a thrill ride that defies all natural laws. Time travel, physical transformations, perceptual distortions and multiple universes are just a few of the things that Jumanji toys with. The most evident phenomena is that the characters run in two different and parallel universes, one where Jumanji exists, and the other where it is just a dream. The life of Judy and Peter as orphans exists in a different world from the one where Jumanji doesn't exist  in other words, Jumanji is a catalyst of fate, an evil entity that does not bring about awe as it did in Allsberg's book, but fear. The world that Allen Parrish is doomed to be incarcerated in the jungles of Jumanji is another one, but that period of time is nonexistent in the world he will eventually live in. This is the beauty of the movie; that these characters can only allow their trauma and epiphanies to cross worlds. With each roll of the dice, the characters grow and change. The ending with 'Jumanji' is mark of the end of that universe  everything that the jungle world had yielded, from the colonist-hunter Van Pelt to the roaring stampede and the monkeys had to return, to be sealed into the game and the universe. The game controls life; but it is merciful when played to the end without cheating. The mental agony and pain must have been tremendous for the Parrishes. Presumably, Alan spent his twenty six years in the jungle, but returned to his old self only to again relive his life as if it never happened. The temporal distortion must have presumably had an effect on his parents, although only Sarah seems to notice. (She was playing the game  and only those playing are directly affected, but in the game universe of Judy and Peter we see a problem in the movie's understanding of temporal change) The power of fate in deciding the endgame was critical in the film. It seems that the game was in itself a game of a game; it was all planned out and ready to go. In fact, it also seems that no matter how crazy or perilous the situation is, the characters cannot be killed. Even Van Pelt says at the Sir Sav A Lot that \"I am hunting only Alan. I won't kill you, since you didn't roll\" He too is bound to the rules of the game, no matter how much of a colonialist he is. The game instills a high level of fear without death, in order for the game to continue, all the characters must be present. So in one way, no one need be scared of anything in the game. Instead, the game builds resilience in the characters. It was natural that in the end the end was initiated by the future; or more appropriately the past. At the end, both Sarah and Alan make up for the trouble they have caused and have a life bond from the experience. The jumping between 1994 and 1964 is a critical aspect where we see that the horrors of the game have allowed Judy and Peter's parents to not die in the ski accident. They are oddly willing to put an end to their vacation when they hardly know the Parrishes \"In the jungle, you must wait, until you roll a five or eight\"  Jumanji \"Roll a two, roll a four, but never ask for more\"  Gautam RATING: 10/10 (amazing) An entertaining, chaotic adventure, one which impressed me as a kid and still does now; I first heard of this successful family adventure movie at school in the late primary grades. It must have been new to the VHS format at the time (meaning I missed its successful theatrical run), and a student in my class brought a copy in for show and tell. I think I was interested in seeing it for months before I finally did. I remember watching it more than once on video in the summer of 1996. After those months of anticipation, I don't think I was let down, even if it did seem weird and scary the first time, with all the chaos. I guess I wasn't used to seeing that in films at the time. I've watched it again twice in recent years, after growing up, and both times, I found that it was still entertaining, unlike some movies I enjoyed in my childhood. In 1969, Alan Parrish is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Brantford, New Hampshire, with an upper class family. One day, after being ambushed by a group of bullies, he hears a mysterious sound of drums coming from a construction site! At the site, he digs up a box, where the sound is coming from, a box which was buried there 100 years earlier! Inside, he finds a board game called Jumanji, and takes it home. When Alan is at home by himself after a falling out with his father, his friend, Sarah Whittle, comes over, and he shows her the game. They begin to play it, not realizing how powerful and dangerous it is! Alan is sucked inside, and Sarah is chased off by bats that come out of the game! 26 years later, two kids, Judy and Peter Shepherd, whose parents have died, move into the old Parrish house with their aunt Nora. The siblings hear the drumming of Jumanji from up in the attic, and find the game. They start playing the game without a clue, just like Alan and Sarah did, and dangerous animals begin to come out of it! Also, Alan is finally released after being trapped in the jungle for 26 years! He learns that the year is 1995, and sadly, his parents have passed away. He must now continue the game with Judy and Peter, and reunite with Sarah. The four of them are all players now, and they must finish the game if things are ever going to go back to normal, which will obviously be very risky! The film starts well with the spooky 1869 sequence, when the box is buried out in the dark. After that, it's usually pretty good around the beginning. During the first of my two latest viewings, I remember finding most of the movie dull before Robin Williams comes in, but with my last viewing, I didn't find that to be the case. There isn't much humour during this part of this film, but there is some suspense. When Williams does make his boisterous entry, that's when the humour starts. After that, there's both excitement, with all the action and chaos, and humour. Williams provides laughs with his antics, but the film doesn't rely entirely on him for the humour. Sarah's reluctance to continue the game in 1995, the scene with Van Pelt, the trigger happy hunter from the game in a gun shop, and Aunt Nora and Officer Carl Bentley witnessing some of the Jumanji animals are also funny. Other merits of \"Jumanji\" include some poignant moments, good CGI effects (even if they're not the best, and have been topped since then), and decent acting, which includes decent child actors, unlike some films. All these things are what I think makes this film good family entertainment. HORRIBLE!; This was on TV again recently, and naturally the kids stopped to watch it. Why I will never know. We own a copy and they rarely if ever put it in the VCR. Whose idea was this movie? Joe Johnston, the guy responsible for some of the worst movies of the 1990s and whose only really decent film was HONEY, which was way back when? I have said previously this is really a horror movie in disguise and obviously not a particularly good one. What in hell is with the special effects? Is there a worse-looking set of animals in film history? I wonder all these years later if maybe the distorted, cartoonish look of the monkeys and lion were intentional, since they sprang from a children's board game. But then why do the elephants, rhinos, pelican and even the oversized mosquito, look relatively normal? Robin Williams is about as bad as he ever got, except for the nightmarishly bad JACK (although I never saw his ripoff of Benigni, which I can just imagine to what depths he plummets, and I forgive him WHAT DREAMS MAY COME since he obviously did not write or direct that fiasco). View JUMANJI at your own mental peril! Dangerous Boarding Game; In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called \"Jumanji\" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan's father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. \"Jumanji\" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90's. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Jumanji\" In the Jungle You Must Wait, Until the Dices Add 5 or 8; This film is about two children playing a mysterious board game that was left by the previous owner of the house they're living in now. They play it and the game begins. A man comes out from the game after staying there for a decade. They figure out the game is dangerous and think it would all go away if they just finish it. During the coarse of the game, there is peril everywhere! This is a good movie, not better than Zathura, but it's still good. I have to warn some parents out there because if you're taking your kids to see this movie, it might scare them. Might. Although it didn't scare me because I'm 14. Characters get hurt. Some even die. There are funny moments and sweet moments. This is a good film that anyone could enjoy. Probably not your little children. Quite a Lot of Rapid Movement; I worked for several years at a bookstore. I remember when the children's book \"Jumanji\" came in. The book jacket with the reckless monkeys was very catchy. It was a very short book, so I have a feeling that some liberties were taken with the plot. There had to be a ton of extrapolation. This is a rapid fire movie which at times takes a bit of industry to keep up with. There are rules to the game and for me, they are very hard to follow. There is also a time element that is in play here. Robin Williams, as usual, plays his character to the hilt. The kids are pretty good as well. I'm sure this would appeal to a younger audience. There is no time for attention spans to expire. The computer generated graphics are wonderful, to be sure. Those monkeys are really the stars of the show. Unique; I am trying to find my words in order to perfectly describe Robin, but i just realized that it's impossible to do it. Words are not enough to describe such a man... I've seen a lot of people in my life, all kind of people, but i never saw someone having so much warmth and kindness in just a small smile like Robin. That's something which makes you to love him unconditionally. The way he acted in the movies was so original that it can not be compared with anyone else in the history of cinema. He's smile made us all better people a little bit, which means he changed the world in he's own way. He will be always with us, and within us. Let's make him immortal !!! Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a 10/10. No No No -- its a 10; This is one of those films which sort of faded into obscurity at time of release but will I believe over time be considered a classic. I have seen it over a dozen times. And, for the purposes of this review, the reason I mention that fact is to ask the obvious question... why? And the why is because of the narrative. It is nearly perfect. Heck, it may even be perfect. If you are going to create a hi-CGI fantasy about children, geared to the child within (so to speak) you need to jump down the rabbit-hole is a convincing way, so that there is no hope of return. This is the essence of every good \"fantasy\" from the beginning of time, from Peter Pan to Alice In the Looking Glass to the Matrix. Once you are in, it is hard to get out. And that hooks the audience. What better way to establish such a narrative than a kid's game with \"turns\" and \"dice\"? Where each roll gets you in deeper? Also a great chance to watch to watch Robin Williams and Dunst before he/she became too old to play these roles; and Bonnie Hunt (great!) before her film career imploded. Postscript 12/14 -- with the recent passing of Robin Williams I wanted to add the following, especially after another viewing. First, it is one of the most perfect fantasies Hollywood has done since the invention of color film (keeping in mind that the best fantasies hail from the 30s and 40s). Second, and I know his fans will not agree, possibly Williams' best work. Early in his career, and he got a chance to play a boy in a man's body. Is there a more perfect role for him?? Hunt did not have what you would call a wide or varied film career but she is pitch perfect here, and matches Williams note for note, emotion for emotion. And Kirsten Dunst, another controversial figure, seems to have had a backwards career, with her impact dwindling as she aged. The highlight of her career may have been kissing Spiderman, but her face holds the camera here in every scene she is in, and she too is pitch perfect. Massively un-appreciated, one of the greatest films in its genre ever, right up there with Harry Potter or Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast. This Ain't No Game!; CONTAINS SPOILERS In 1869, two boys bury something unknown but whatever it is, it's very dangerous. It stays for 100 years. In 1969, young Alan Parrish rides his bike one lovely day, unfortunately he's soon chased by Billy Jessup and his gang. Alan goes to his father, Samuel's shoe factory. Alan tells his father what's up, but his father merely tells him that he must stand and face something you're afraid of, so Alan did and got the crap kicked out of him. Suddenly, he heard drums beating. It was in a construction site. He dug up a wooden board game called Jumanji. At home, Alan's parents have announced that they shall send him to Cliffside School for Boys. Alan refuses to go. Samuel get's mad and storms out of the house with his wife. Alan's friend, Sarah Widdle, comes over that night and the two decide to play the game Alan found. It resulted in Alan being sucked into the game until someone would roll a 5 or 8. 26 years later-1995. A woman named Nora, her niece Judy and nephew Peter buy the old Parrish house. One aternoon, while Aunt Nora left for the office and the kids were about to leave for school when they hear drums beating. The game was calling. They dig it out of the attic and decide to play it. Out of the game comes monkeys, mosquitos and a lion! Also, Alan comes out. He's very grateful, then goes to the old shoe factory to find his parents. He learns of their passing; by finishing the game, they can put an end to the wild animal attacks, so the three go off to find Sarah Widdle, because according to the game, it was her turn. At first she was reluctant to play, but she did. They encounter a huge pod plant and a hunter, Van Pelt who wants to kill Alan for some reason. Well, after braving a stampede, a huge rain fall, giant spiders and an earthquake, the game was over and all went back to 1969 where Alan patched things up with his father, he and Sarah get rid of the game and live happily ever after in the bright and cheerful 1995, rather than the dark one Jumanji had created. Pretty good movie! Nice special effects. Robin Williams was good, as always. Bonnie Hunt was good. The kids were too. Kirsten Dunst grew up to play Spiderman's love interest. Also, the same actor that plaus Samuel Parrish (Jonathan Hyde of Richie Rich) also plays Van Pelt. I hear there's going to be a sequel: Jumanji 2. But it doesn't have Robin Williams. For the life of me, I can't figure out what it will be like. But for now, you gotta see the first one! -- It's time to play the game. You can't move until somebody roll 5 or 8.; Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. \"Jumanji\" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game. The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078; Despite the fact that I am a huge Robin Williams fan, I had never seen Jumanji, it just never appealed to me, but even since Williams' untimely passing, I've been trying to view his entire filmography. I also wanted to catch the original film, before its reputation was irreparably damaged by next years re-make, featuring the Rock, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart. The film focuses on young Alan Parrish (Robin Williams), the son of a rich industrialist, who is always in the way. One day, he finds a weird board game, buried in a construction site, and decides to play with a friend, but this is no ordinary game, and Alan becomes trapped inside for decades. It isn't until two kids, moving into a new house discover the game and start to play it, that Alan is freed. Not wanting these kids, to face the same fate he did, they track down his old friend, and decide to finish the game and put the madness to an end. I think when Robin Williams played a child or a crazy person he was at his best. Those were the time when he could really just let go, be free, and be truly hilarious. As in most films like this, Williams is the film, the rest of the cast revolves around him, and without him, this is just another kids movie. Kids love these quirky, weird films, and parents hate being dragged to them, but Williams had a way of making both sides happy and making them both want to see it, that's what Jumanji was. For all intense and purposes this is a kids movie, with Williams acting like a big kid, but making adult jokes, innuendoes, and just being that guy who made him a legend. Almost Thoroughly Enjoyable; If I had been 10 or 12 when this movie came out it would probably be my favorite.  As I was 34, my first reaction was that there was too much screaming. But there's much here for an imaginative youngster (or oldster) to enjoy.  The script is generally witty, and except for the screaming, parents will not be bored watching it -- and if they squint their minds eyes enough to remember what they enjoyed before puberty, they'll get a nostalgic rush. This is everything family entertainment should be.  And though it does involve the supernatural, it is presented in a negative light and none of the characters relish being part of it. I guess that life is a game of chance!; You know the drill: young Alan Parrish gets sucked into a board game called Jumanji, returns when a brother and sister are playing 26 years later, and has to battle the animals that wreak havoc on the town. It all seems pretty simple, but they play some neat tricks with it in the movie. As the adult Alan, Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but still makes the character admirable. With good support from Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and Patricia Clarkson, this is a pretty interesting movie. I will admit that the monkeys looked pretty fake, but we can't dwell on that in this movie; the point is to enjoy oneself while watching it. Oh and one more thing: from \"Jumanji\", I learned the difference between alligators and crocodiles. If I could go back...; I love this movie. I don't know why. Maybe because I wonder what it would be like to start my life over again when I was 10 or 12, knowing what I know now at...well, much older. My favorite part is at the end, when Alan and Sarah come face to face in 1995 with the 2 kids who played the game with them the PREVIOUS 1995. Visually very interesting and not a rip off of any other film, that's for sure! Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Exciting Family Adventure; In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called \"Jumanji\", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished. Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human. The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like \"Dead Poet's Society\" or \"Good Morning, Vietnam\"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality. This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor. Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the \"Narnia\" stories). Fortunately, any moralising in \"Jumanji\" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of \"alternative timelines\". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10 Meaningful themes for all ages; This film is NOT a 'kids' film and it is NOT just another example of Hollywood making money off of an already existing product. Let me tell you what it is. It's a film that examines such pertinent themes as frustrated adolescence, negligent adults and wishes that do and don't come true. The cast is superb. The script provides them with enough action so that they can just do what they do best (ie comedy) without being 'preachy' with the messages that the writer was trying to convey. I was anxiously awaiting the sequel because I figured that, as movie technology advances, some of the flatness of the special effects would be fixed. Oh well. David Alan Grier was especially funny. He is one of Hollywood's best kept secrets. He belongs in movies not just T.V.. Decent family entertainment; On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children. Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it. Lame, lamer, lamest.; I guess this must be meant to appeal to kids, because has that R.L. Stein flavor to it -- you can't suspend disbelief because the whole thing is just so cheesy and lame. The closet thing to an interesting character is Carl the cop -- although Sara seeing a shrink after watching Alan vanish IS a hoot. Fine for the kids, but adults would do better with a book and a hot bath. Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... The jungle; This is an excellent movie for all ages. Congratulations to the cast, production, stunts and all the people. And now I want know what's happen in the jungle when Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) was there for 26 years. This should be a good adventure. This game is like no other.; Roll doubles and look out.  Elaborate special effects highlight this tale about two kids who release an imprisoned player trapped for decades in a supernatural board game. Story line is quite stupid, but this is so much fun to watch. Robin Williams does his thing. A young Kirsten Dunst is charming in this preview of her future talents. Rounding out this mish-mash of a cast are: Bebe Neuwirth, David Alan Grier, Bradley Pierce, Bonnie Hunt and Jonathan Hyde in a dual role. Special effects and sight gags are redeeming. The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for 25(?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\" Probably not perfect, but very fun; Jumanji is a highly imaginative and very fun movie. The visuals are good, and the story is creative and exciting. The storyline consists of a man being sucked into a board game. 26 years later, two kids find the board game and set him free. However, the game board has already released a few dangers, and those dangers must be stopped. The only way to do that is to finish the board game, and the animals (or whatever else was released from the game) will be put back into the game. There is action and minor thrills, and the movie emerges as being a fun experience. It's kind of creative, and it's an excellent adventure film. Sure, it is a bit cliché'd and the monkeys look pretty corny, but don't let them distract you from the overall enjoyment of the movie. 6.5/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment. original, not like any other game; I saw this when I was 9, and I was obsessed with it and saw it 3 times in the theater, and it was my favorite movie. The whole idea of slight, unhappy, 12-year-old Alan Parrsih (Adam Hann-Byrd-Little man Tate, Halloween H:20) getting trapped in a board game in 1969, for 26-years and coming back as a grown man. The idea was unforgettable to my interest in time, and I imagined my self then coming back 35-years old. The movie is so elaborate and original, the stampede was always my favorite, it's got such edge-of-year seat action with the Rhinos, Elephants, and Zebras crashing throught the wall at the last second, and they used the most dangerous animals possible. Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) ALan's childhood friend, and Peter (Bradley Pierce) and Judy (Kirsten Dunst, along with Alan play the game and bring Gian mosquitos, vines and a Hunter from the game. The movies also really funny especially the cop. Geeky Randy's summary; Fun family film about a magical board game that hosts many dangers that can only be stopped when a player finishes. The entire cast does their job well, but the only one not interchangeable is Hyde in a double-role as the main character's wealthy stern father and a big-game hunter (hint: intentional parallel). Entertaining from start to finish, but even children in 1995 were likely very aware that the scary creatures on screen were nothing more than special-effectsbecause of this, it's difficult to ever get lost in the delicious chaos despite all the funny moments and thrills. Still, despite its flaws, the story is interesting enough for the whole family enjoy and the film is good enough to be replayed every few years. *** (out of four) A game for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind; A fun family film about a game. I was sceptical, but as I like Robin Williams, I was obliged to go and see the film. The first thing that hit was the atmosphere. It's a bizarre and quite scary film. Well for a 7 year old anyway. Robin Williams plays the part really well but the real star of the film is the special effects. The stampede and various other disasters from the game were fantastic for their day. OK they look a bit dated now but in their time, they were some of the most advanced special effects ever used in movies. Bonnie Hunt steals the show with her humour and character. And the 2 children are fantastic as actors. The only thing that lets Jumanji down is the tag line. It gives away too much of the story of the film. But don't let that spoil things. The film is an unmissable adventure based on a small picture book. Surprised? You will be. IT's the most great movie EVER, you can't get Enough of it; I want to give this movie what it really deserve ,If i will say there is movie that i will never forget in my life ,it will be this great movie for the brilliant actor robin Williams. first of all, I want to thanks all the cast of this movie and the great director ,for bringing it to us. when I want to be refresh and happy and laugh I will watch it when I want to feel the power of love and the thriller of adventure, I will watch it , there are a lot of people how see it as for children only but its really not , it was like they know where to start and finish. this movie is for everyone its my best movie ever I give it 10%10 don't miss it Not board; Watched this on TV where it was aired as a tribute to the late Robin Williams. It's an enjoyable family-entertainment fantasy adventure with Williams playing a grown man who as a boy was sucked into a mysterious, dark board game called Jumanji, freed years later by a couple of young children who happen upon the game when they move into Williams's character by this time run-down house. Along with Williams also fully-grown girl friend of the time Kirsten Dunst, the four of them brave everything the game throws at them to finish it and free Williams to return to his old life. And does the game throw everything at them! Crazy monkeys, a roaring lion, a jungle which comes to life, hordes of stampeding elephants zebras and rhinos and one very persistent big game hunter. A veritable special effects fest, while the plot amounts to no more than awaiting the outcome of the next roll of the dice on the board, it all makes for good clean exciting fun and who amongst us as never enjoyed playing a board game as a child. The back stories about Williams being bullied as a child, having a fractious relationship with his dad and his adult wooing of Dunst are lightly drawn but all of course resolved happily ever after by the end. Williams is fine after he makes his delayed first appearance, portraying yet again a child trapped in a man's body just as he did in a line going back through Peter Pan in \"Hook\", \"Popeye\" all the way to his breakout part in \"Mork and Mindy\". Dunst offers good support and the kids aren't too gauche and sentimental either. Nice to see \"Cheers\" Bebe Neuwirth get a decent part too. I wouldn't call it Robin Williams defining role but as an update on the old children's matinée features, this was an entertaining feature made the better by Williams engaging performance. R.I.P. to him. When two kids from the 60's stumble upon a game, one of them is sucked into its jungle.  Now it's up to two present day kids to finish it.; ********/10 This movie deserves more than it received because it is not only a very different plot but has excellent character development, which is key to a great movie. The special effects are so-so (due to the time period in which it was made), but it is overall exciting while humorous. There isn't a movie quite like this one, and is one of my favorites. Robbin Williams is tremendous and while watching it you forget his true identity. Kerstien Dunst is young, but is impressive for her age, commonly not found in some movies. I guess if I'd have to sum this movie up in one word it'd be \"unique\". Not many films have monsoons indoors or mansions turned into jungles. The Disney movie that could have been; Hunt and Williams play the parts of shellshocked-delayed stress syndrome surviviors quite well. The story is entertaining and engrossing, with both elements of light and darkness. The effects-well, they DO look a bit unreal-and perhaps that is for the best-it adds a sense of unreality to the story -after all, these things come from a board-game universe! Even Van Pelt looks a bit CGI...and Bebe Nuewerth is a sweetie. Not for 13+ age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for 1980 not for 1995. Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. Watts meets New England; Disaster visits a New England town: When all hell breaks loose, when beasts from nowhere trample the streets and earthquakes rip the blocks and giant mosquitoes and God-knows-what-next befall the descendants of pilgrims and fishermen, of Minutemen and revolutionaries and of immigrants yearning to breath free, those same hard-scrabble, salt-of-the-earth, no-nonsense patriots all join hands, pull together, and-- . . . loot their neighbors' downtown storefronts! Unbelievable.  Tinseltown belts out a fairly well-done and imaginative fantasy (which truly `Jumanji' is), and then--wouldn't you know it?--foul it with one of the many flies stuck in the ointment that is Hollywood, a scene so diagnostic of the intellectual sickness that has infested the industry since Hellman sang her praises to Stalin.  Then again, maybe it is believable. `Jumanji's' only other flaws: a part too small for the underrated Bebe Neuwirth (a joy to watch always and here no less so), kids full of bravery that's a little too scripted and moments of suspense that really aren't. If we can ignore all that, even the brief bit of class-warfare propaganda, then \"Jumanji' becomes eminently watchable, even memorable. But promise us you won't loot any stores next time you see monkeys charging down the street. Grade A Effects; This movie is the kind of movie you wouldn't want to watch when you're trying to get to sleep. This movie is lurking with action and adventure around every corner, along with some animals. Great effects, good plot, and interesting characters. A *** out of ****. Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. Good, classic, family fun; Despite being rejected by many a film critic for being childish and lacking in the classic sweepstakes, I found this film more than enough to satisfy my evening desires. With its strong plot and good actors, this film has much going for it, despite slightly lame CGI, its the story that carries you on. I have heard few people praise this film but I believe it to be a classic due to having an eerie dark sense all the way through until the credits roll, whilst still maintaining comedy and being for the whole family. It is bound to keep the viewer thinking of the awful situation these people face long after viewing has finished. Overall, one of the high points of Williams' career, and Kursten Dunst has never been better. Try it, you might surprise yourself.  Excellent!; There is only one way to describe Jumanji: excellent. The plot is very, original, with outstanding concepts packed into each individual scene. After viewing this movie, the wild side of the jungle gets into you, making you want to dare to play the game. Although the computer animation may not look all that real, I still give this movie a 10/10, for an outstanding plot, casting, and spirit, which any great movie has. Almost 20 years on and it's still entertaining kids of all ages; Jumanji was on TV today, and my 8 year old son had liked him in \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and I remembered it being fun, so with sweets and crisps we sat down to watch it. Orphans Judy (A young Kristen Dunst, who had started in \"An Interview With A Vampire\" the previous year, but still a few years away from Spiderman fame) and Peter move in to a mansion with their Aunt (Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers) where the find a board game called Jumanji. When they start playing, they free Alan Parish (Robin Williams) who was trapped in the game when he was a child. Robin Williams is always fun to watch and he was very popular at the time, due to movies like \"Aladdin\" and \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and Kristen Dunst was a real talent as a young actress, none of the annoying traits of usual child actors. Of the supporting cast David Alan Grier is fun as a hapless Police Officer, as is Jonathan Hyde in duel roles as a hunter and young Alan's Dad. Defo worth checking out if you have kids, and more than enjoyable even if you don't. Some of the special effects have dated badly, but are still OK, most of the humour is spot on too. My son got a big kick out if it and really enjoyed it. And I thought for a 19 year old special effects laden kids movie it had held up pretty well. I love this film!; I loved this movie! First of all, my #1 favorite actress is Kirsten Dunst, who plays Judy! I have seen Kirsten in countless other films including: Bring It On, Disney's Anastasia, Mona Lisa Smile, Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2 (June 30), and (Duh!) Jumanji of course. We have a lot in common. I am a HUGE fan of Robin Williams as well. He has played in films that I've seen such as: Mrs. Doubtfire, (also starring Pierce Brosnan who plays the worlds greatest Secret Agent: Bond, James, Bond. Robin has also been in: Disney's Aladdin (The Genie), Patch Adams, Flubber, Biscentanial Man, and Hook. I have seen Bonnie Hunt in her t.v. show, Life With Bonnie, and Cheaper By The Dozen starring the ever sooooo funny comedian Steve Martin and my sister's favorite actress Hilary Duff. I have a lot of favorite actor's but only one actress, and that's Kirsten! When I first saw her in Jumanji I fell in love with her. She is one beautiful young lady. I didn't know who she was though, LOL!!! I didn't recognize her in Spider-Man \"sigh\". As I looked at the credit's I saw a name: Kirsten Dunst. I remember seeing that name in the end credit's for Jumanji. I just about fainted, LOL!!!! I rented Jumanji again, and I looked at her and I realized: \"Wow, she hasn't changed a bit!\" \"She's still got those big Blue eye's that I just love,\" she hasn't lost her sense of humor,\" and I will always, always, ALWAY'S LOVE HER SMILE! Every movie I've seen her in, she's always been a really hot Redhead, Well, in Jumanji she wasn't a redhead, but, SHE WAS STILL HOT! LOL!!!! She's a legend, to me. I looked at her biography on IMDb.com and I saw that she was born on April 30,1982! I just about fell out of my chair. LOL!!! I was born April 10,1988!!!!!! She's six years older than me, but heck! I still love her. But, I'll always remember her as that little girl named Judy in Jumanji! My favorite line that she said was when the Cop commented on Robin's clothes for the first time: \"He's a Vegetarian! I was sucking in air, I was laughing so hard. Another scene was in the rain in Jumanji when Robin and Bonnie were about to kiss, and Kirsten is in the back rolling her eyes! LOL!!! That brought be back to the upside down kiss in the rain in Spider-Man! Jumanji is a fun movie! It can be a little intense sometimes, but it can also be funny. One last thing: KIRSTEN DUNST IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE MY FAVORITE ACTRESS! THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE! Til the dice read five or eight \n",
       " Jumanji; Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in 1995, I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 1800's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in 1969, transporting him into the jungle world for 26 years until two new children stumble upon its drumming. Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time \n",
       " well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects. The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be \"real\", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end. The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still childrenone had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow upand with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think. There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as \"Soulman\" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the \"adult\" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal. A great movie; JUMANJI I loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today! The movie is about a boy who finds a board game called Jumanji. When he takes it home and starts to play it with a friend, he soon realises that this is no ordinary game. He gets sucked into the game and is not released again until 26 years later 2 more kids find the game and release him. Now he is grown up and has to find a way to end this game before everything it releases destroys the town. Due to the sad passing of the genius that was Robin Williams, the TV channels have decided to show all of his movies. Jumanji was the first one I saw. The story to this film is like not her that I had seen before. It was an original idea (unless there is another film I don't know about) that was just so imaginative. It works really well and has a great adventure element about it. The effects are average. This was made in the mid 90s so that probably has something to do with it. The animals were obviously not real. You could see the lion was so mechanical it made me laugh. And the other animals were so obviously computer generated. But it was comical and that just added to the fun of the film. The acting was great. The main character was played by Robin Williams. He was as energetic and full of character in this role, just like he brought to every role he took. Other cast members were Jonathan Hyde, a young Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bonnie Hunt. Bonnie Hunt was brilliant. Her reaction and facial expressions made me laugh a few times in this. Another stand out performance was by David Alan Grier. David was so funny as the cop. His comedy timing was excellent and deserves a mention. This film really does keep you entertained throughout and is just a lot of fun to watch... Even now nearly 20 years later. I will give this 7 out of 10. Normally I end my reviews with a quote from the movie, but this time I just want to say how gutted I am about the news of Robins death. I am a fan of his work. I watched Mork and Mindy when I was a kid and grew up watching Jumanji, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam, Jack etc... There were so many great films that he made. I always saw Robin as so full of energy and full of life. He had one of the greatest smiles in Hollywood and when i saw an interview with him, he seemed so chirpy and happy. It just shows that in front of the camera, you never know what is going on in people's heads. I was sad to hear he had been suffering from depression. Depression is such a deadly illness. I know this sounds stupid, but I am gutted that I was not there to talk to him, help him. I hate to think that he felt so alone, especially as he had millions of fans all over the world that knew him on screen. He made the world laugh out loud so many times. Even through bad times in my life, watching his movies has put a smile on my face. Robin deserved much more happiness than he got. He gave so much to me and the rest of the world and it doesn't seem right that he should end his life this way. I will miss seeing new movies from him, but will always continue to go back to enjoy his old ones. Robin will live on in my house and he will always continue to make me smile. R.I.P. Robin Williams. A 90s classic.; Jumanji has some decent acting from the adults and from the kids. Apparently this film is set in New Hampshire - the scenery is not all that, maybe because New Hampshire itself is not all that, but regardless this is a fun fast-paced adventure flick that is never boring. An error in this film is that this board game is depicted as some sort of master of the universe, the majority of the film is set in 1995 - When Alan is out of the game and everything else from the game gets sucked back in the film goes back to 1969 where Alan and Sarah are kids again, fast forward to the 90s and they meet Judy, Peter and their parents, i guess the movie wanted to make it an extremely happy ending where the parents get a second chance, but then at the same time Judy and Peter never remember Alan and Sarah, this is the definition of a fantasy movie, if you think about the logic of it too much it'll drive you crazy. Bottom line if this error never happened there'd be no movie, this is what a fantasy movie is - a motion picture that is completely out there and difficult to wrap your head around. A lot of the scenes are still embarrassingly funny - a few examples - when the monkeys shoot the roof of the car and drive off, some of the behavior and dialogue from the police officer Carl Bentley, when Alan and Sarah get stuck in the floor, and the result of Bentley's literal wreck of a car is embarrassingly cringe-worthy in itself. Jumanji actually has a realistic element which is the behavior of Alan's father, he doesn't seem to care that much about Alan, is self- absorbed expecting Alan to follow his footsteps with boarding school, and is generally quite strict and cold and just like Alan said during one scene - his father could barely even hug him. After Alan went missing the father got depressed, stopped going to work and that was the end of it, he only seemed to care about Alan when Alan wasn't there, what's the point of that?! it's like emotional displacement or something, it was all a little too late, but as we see at the end Alan's parents are still alive and it's clear that they have time to change their standoffish relationship. This is the definition of a children's movie - everything has to be happy with no tragedies at the end. Jumanji is very dramatic but brilliant especially the \"Iv'e seen things you've only seen in your nightmares\" scene and the \"26 years ago you played a game with a little boy down the street\" scene - those two pieces of dialogue were done fantastically by Robin Williams and his facial expression and body language worked perfectly with the dialogue. This motion picture also shows the viewers how children think, the scene where Alan mentions that he \"remembers the front porch being a lot bigger\" tells us that kids see everything bigger than they actually are. The funky new-age woman \"Sarah\" - the adult version is also a likable character even though she sometimes talks crap with her star- sign/zodiac-sign garbage. There is no chemistry between her and Alan though, but they can get away with it because that is not what this film is about. The special effects are what they are, they're not as bad as to ruin the movie. The actor who plays Alan's dad also plays the human hunter, why they used the same actor i don't know, but regardless he did a good job in both roles. Jumanji is set in a small town and if you are starting to dislike small town settings as i am then you can choose not to focus on the town and focus more on the main plot. Thankfully this flick only has literally a few main characters and it does a great job of making sure the plot outweighs anything else. Ja Rule Jumanji; 'Jumanji' is a drama comedy about a boy who is always picked on by a bunch of bullies. He gets sucked into a disastrous game board called 'Jumanji'. He was taken to a jungle for 26 long years. He then comes back after the dice read 8 and with the 3 other players who unleash the unexpected dangers of the jungle\n",
       " onto the real world. Alan Parish is a troubled boy with kids picking on him 24/7. One day while walking through a construction site he finds a chest that holds 'Jumanji' - the board inside it. He starts playing this game with a young girl, Sarah, where he is sucked into the game. After 26 yrs he comes back as a man!! Sarah Whittle is one of the bully's girlfriends and she brought back Alan's bike when he invited her in to play the game. She was really scared when Alan was sucked into the game, after that she was chased by bats all the way down the street. It looks so real but when she falls over and a bat is on her shoulder, it looks Judy and Peter are the two other players who live with their generous aunt because their parents had died in a car crash. Judy lies because it makes her feel better and Peter doesn't talk to any one except Judy. Peter turns into a half monkey/human for cheating, which special effects make this look real. Together all four encounter many different but dangerous stuff from the jungle. Not only does it affect Alan, Sarah, Judy and Peter, it affects the whole town. All in all 'Jumanji' is a rollicking imaginative adventure that will carry you away\n",
       " literally!! My Childhood; This movie made my childhood. I love Robin Williams movies, Jumanji introduced him to me. Jumanji is a movie that everyone should watch. Robin Williams will again make you appreciate living as he always does in his movies. The movie contains full of fantasy objects. The writer has a really great imagination. I will make my children to watch this movie after all years that pass. While watching this movie as a kid, I was scared, excited and happy. It makes you to feel every kind of feeling. This indicates that the movie has done a good job. I again recommend to everyone. Jumanji appeals for all ages. I am pretty sure I will watch the movie again when I get old with the same emotions when I watched it in the first time. Jumanji Review; Jumanji is a film directed by Joe Johnston based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg. Now I wasn't quite excited to see the films considering the reviews. But I did enjoy Zathura, the spiritual sequel to this film so I deiced to give it a go. And to my surprise I was quite entertained by the film. Plot: Judy and Peter play a board game to some disastrous results. Story and direction: The film opens up with 2 children from 1869 burying something and saying that whoever opens this up may God be with them. I mean this scene was basically not necessary. The film could have opened from 1969 with our protagonist Alan Parrish. We see Alan's world where he is bullied a lot and hides in his father's shoe factory. There we are introduced to Carl who I think was not necessary for the film in the first place. Then we see Alan taking the Jumanji game to his home and opening it. in the meanwhile, we see Alan's parents deciding to send him to boarding school to which he objects and decides never to talk to them again. Then Alan and Sarah begin to play the game when Alan gets sucked into it and Sarah getting scared runs for her life. Then the film takes a 26 year leap, where we are introduced to 2 new characters Peter and Judy, who have been given a quite nice back story. They open up the game and while they playing Alan comes out of it. Then we are taken on a joyride where the try to finish the game with a now grown Sarah. Now the thing that felt awful in the film was the CGI. It felt like you were watching some big patches of imagery that were just pasted onto the screen. Then I guess the Van Pelt character. He was just too laughable for me. And was wasted a lot. And finally, the revised 1995 version wherein some things were not explained rightly, according to me. Performances: Robin Williams made me remember that why I will be remembering him as a great actor. His comic timing was spot on. RIP Sir Williams. Bonnie Hunt was also great as Sarah. Kirsten Dunst was a great child artist in the film. So as Bradley Pierce. Favirite Scene: The scene where Alan pops up to save Peter and Judy from a lion and his joy that he has returned home after 26 years of being trapped in the game. Robin Williams just acted so great in this scene. Verdict: Although with some misses, Jumanji is a very much watchable film. I enjoyed my time with this movie. I am going with a 7.5/10 Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is 1969, and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats. 26 years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good! QFC - Jumanji; Jumanji is a fun filled film with great special effects, gripping action and it revolves around an interesting although absurd idea of a damned board game. However absurd this idea may be, it works as far as the adventure goes. It has many flaws because eventually the absurdity becomes too much and, especially for adults, it will become annoying because of its repetition in the the attempt of filling the movie with 'funnys'. Robin Williams himself is a pleasant surprise as the action hero. His choice may have been a little surprising, but alas, Williams shows he is able to be anything, anytime, anywhere. So hats off to his performance, not the deepest ever but an enjoyable turn for him. Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. My first childhood film and one of my all time favorites!; I was born in 1994 so I am one year older than but my Uncle bought a copy of Jumanji when I was in pre-school and the whole family watched it together. And after seeing the film for the first time, the story is just like a funny adventure to me and I really love it. I always sneak up to the CD cabinet to watch it again because my grandmother always gone mad every time I switch the CD player and the television. And after a several replays, the movie grown deeper to me; the message of the film and everything. Until now, I still watch the movie and still having lots of laugh. Early CGI Makes the Monkeys Look Fake! Otherwise It's Amazing!; An enchanted board game breaks into the real world and the only way out of it is to finish the game! The monkeys look \"washed-out\" and so do some of the wild zoo animals; which is why most of the rest of the EFX are mechanical or use backdrops and mattes. Otherwise a very strong 10 would be my vote, as the casting works and the plot shows lots of imagination and flair. With a \"sly wink\" to \"Peter Pan\", Alan's father plays both his dad and Van Pelt the Hunter. My two favorite scenes are when the house gets folded in half and eaten by the monstrous plant, and when everything swirls backwards into the gameboard. I also love it when the house goes \"wild\" and turns into a swamp complete with nasty alligators. I do not like the scene where the little boy turns into a monkey with a tail. Young children may find it disturbing like the donkey transformation in \"Pinocchio\". \"Jumanji\" is suspenseful and scary but no one actually dies in the film. Therefore, it's much more enjoyable when viewed again. The only one who seemed to hate it was Roger Ebert, but it's only too scary for pre-schoolers. Most \"users\" love it! What \"scares\" me the most in this film: the bats, insects, spiders, alligators, and The Hunter. The sequel will not have the charisma of the late and great Robin Williams. I still miss him. He was a comic genius. If there was a market for it, I would like it to be re-imagined with better graphics like the old \"Star Trek TOS\" reissue. A breathless unforgettable adventure!; I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind... This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure. Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story. Great! 10 out of 10 from me! Game Over, Man; Spoilers herein. The reason this film was made was because they could do the effects. That reason has no power now, and in fact most of them already look a bit cheezy. But there are some interesting elements: --Kirstin Dunst at her peak. --Robin Williams in his best role. Or rather for the role best suited to a manic comic. --A pretty cool house, one of the best in recent memory. --Some clever time folding. --A screenwriter's wet dream: in addition to creating a film world that sucks in viewer into an artificial reality, to have that film world contain another one. That world-within-the world is exactly as far from the normal world of the film as it is from us. Just like the film, it grabs us once we start and won't let go until the end. Clever idea. Not exploited. Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements. Jumanji: One of My Personal Favourites. Period.; I was about one years old when this came out, by three I was mesmerised by the analog and digital effects Jumanji contained. It stood aside the efforts of Jurassic Park, but more animal-based as Jurassic Park was dinosaurs. Robin Williams pulls off a strong performance as Alan Parrish. The film revolved his character playing the game and escaping the world the game brought to him. It had Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce aside Williams whom join this adventure. I believe the film took a creative angle, which more fluctuation that the book left for the imagination. Here it follows the book accurately, just with expansion amongst the book's basis. Hence allowed more adventure and opened more for the viewer digging themselves within this jungle adventure. I can go on about the film's details and how they amaze me. But I conclude Jumanji: One of My Personal Favourites. Period. wild CGI destruction gets repetitive; In 1869, two boys bury a mysterious dangerous wooden chest. In 1969 Brantford, New Hampshire, young Alan Parrish gets picked on by bullies. He finds the box in a local construction site. He opens the chest to find a board game Jumanji. His father is sending him to boarding school. He is about to run away when his best friend Sarah Whittle comes by. They play the game and Alan is pulled into the board game. Twenty six years later, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) buys the rundown mansion planning to open a bed-and-breakfast. She brings her niece Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter (Bradley Pierce) who lost their parents in a car accident. The kids find the board game in the attic and start playing it. Alan (Robin Williams) is released. They track down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) to finish the game and bring all the released apparitions to an end. Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) was a friend who worked at Alan's shoe factory and is now a cop. The game brings out big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) who looks like Alan's father Sam. The basic idea of a board game that comes alive is one with great possibilities. I wish that it is more than just a series of crazy CGI destruction. I wish that the players needed to use their brain power to solve clues. The constant escaping from one thing to the next gets a little bit repetitive. They start piling on top of one another. Williams is not quite as lovable as expected. Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier are kind of fun. There is an uncontrolled quality to this children's movie. Imaginative (spoiler); This is probably one of the most imaginative movies I have seen in a while. I mean, it has an entire back story, as we can see in the beginning, when those two kids are trying to get rid of the game. Then it goes to 1969, when Alan finds the game, he and Sarah start playing, and he gets sucked into Jumanji. Then, throughout the rest of the movie, Alan comes out of the jungle and he, Sarah, Judy, and Peter continue playing the game and unleashing all these dangerous animals (and Van Pelt) and the monsoon and killer plants into the city. And at the end, those kids in Japan find the game. Very well thought out. Certainly worth a look. pretty good, except...; Jumanji is an enjoyable, and at times exciting family adventure. Only one major flaw: the special effects. Jumanji relies on special effects for impact. Nothing wrong with that, only its so easy to tell that they are special effects. Enough fun to get you to sit through it, but they should really find another effects crew next time. 2/4 Fun!; I give this movie a ten on ten. I may be biased as I watched this movie when I was ten and whenever I watch it, it brings back fond memories of lazing around and watching movies during my summer vacations. But I am surprised that the overall rating for this movie is 6.5 (when I write this review), I expected it to be at least 7. This really is a fun movie to watch with some hilarious scenes. The monkey bike riding scene stands out it particular. The special effects looked good when I was young but now the fake animals are not very impressive. Jurassic Park was made before this movie and had much better special effects. Robin Williams does seem too old to play a 35 year old Alan Parish but he is a brilliant actor and you do not mind accepting him as Alan. Bonnie Hunt does a good job too as the paranoid Sarah Whittle. The kids do a great job too, especially Bradley Pierce; look out for the scene where he is searching for an axe. And David Grier is brilliant as the bumbling sheriff Carl Bentley. I suggest you watch this movie with your family on a weekend. Its worth it! Epitome of Moronic Hollywood Film-Making; A previous reviewer wrote: \"A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie.\" I agree in part and disagree in part with that comment. The problem is impossible to pinpoint, because there are PLENTY of \"big problems\" with this movie! \"Random hazard generator\" is the PERFECT description of the ancient board game! Random hazard after random hazard until the game ends is what is supposed to pass for \"plot\" in this movie. Did anybody count how many times the game board fell out of and back into the players' hands? That, too is supposed to pass for tension. Ultimately, the film fails because there isn't any development of the back story. What was the origin of the game? Now, that would have been an interesting question to explore! And how does the game work? All we ever see is the game's projection of \"random hazards\" OUTWARD into the reality of the players, but somehow Alan (Robin Williams) apparently was sucked INTO the game. How did that happen, and why doesn't it happen to any of the current players of the game? Actually, the guy in the pith helmet is, more or less, the human villain in this movie, but he is never more than an inexplicable, evil cartoon. Was he, too sucked into the game like Alan, or is he the sole human \"random hazard\" generated by the game? Why is he so determined, not to hunt animals, but to MURDER Alan? The film just glosses over the fact that this sub-plot is actually one of premeditated murder! The hunter guns for Alan simply because the plot demands it. But the movie makes no attempt whatever to explain the character. Never once did I sense any genuine emotional chemistry among the characters. Just a bunch of actors acting - not INTERACTING. The love story sub-plot felt obligatory, never genuine. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt never generated enough chemistry to make me care whether Alan and Sarah got together in the predictable end. All in all, this film has the germ of an interesting idea that is really wasted by focusing on mindless, non-stop \"random hazards,\" poor CGI effects, \"lots of screaming and running around\" and insufficient character development. Except for the precise nature of each \"random hazard,\" the whole film was disappointingly predictable, including the cliché of the almost-kiss in the midst of peril routine. How many zillion times has that been used? The dialog is a similarly endless stream of clichés. The issue was never HOW the game would end - but WHEN. The more interesting issues were never even glanced at. This kind of movie can only appeal to people raised on video games. It was generated by that kind of adventure-for-the-sake-of-adventure mentality, and it has that same kind of feel. LOVE THIS MOVIE!; Last night, May 2,2003  this movie was on again........no matter what other show we might be browsing at the time, we invariably start watching Jumanji,,,,,,we enjoy the hilarity and antics of all the characters,  it's done for shear  fun and entertainment, and we don't care if the special effects may be outdated,  we still consider it one of the best! So there! :-) Two  Happy Fishes  from oHIo Fine special effects, fizzled screenplay; This is another of those films where a 30-minute documentary on how they did the special effects would be a lot more interesting (not to mention a lot shorter) than the movie itself. The digital effects and animatronics are great; the screenplay doesn't work. A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie. The pasted-on homilies the screenplay comes up with _ the need for courage, commitment, real parent-child communication _ are drowned out in the hubbub, and a good cast (not to mention a big budget) is wasted. And they're planning a sequel to THIS? Have they run out of good (or even mediocre) films to do sequels to? Game You Could Only Dream About; Alan Parrish is the son of wealthy shoe maker Samuel Parrish. But the life of a rich man's son changes when young Alan comes upon a new board game, he is transported into it while playing it. Twenty or so years later two orphaned children, Judy (Kristen Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) come upon the game and play it. Next thing they now, Alan pops out of the game twenty years older along with a lion and some monkeys. It is a race to win the game with Alan (Robin Williams), Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt), Judy, and Peter while trying to outrun stampedes and Van Pelt, the man hunter. The movie has what a movie should have. The interaction of some of then animals is sometimes scary, sometimes funny, and sometimes just strange. Robin Williams is good like always and supported by Dunst, Hunt, and Jonathan Hyde (Van Pelt). It's what some mite call a child thriller. What to classify it as is though but it was good. Jumanji. Starring: Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kristen Dunst, Bradley Pierce, and Jonathan Hyde. 3 out of 5 Stars. Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Oh waw this is what Twister should be like!; Remember Twister? Well, this movie has probably got the same amount of special effects BUT is much more fun to watch. Let me explain. It has got a story to tell. Twister was only about twisters. Anyway, 'Jumanji' hasn't only got yummy fx, but also a verrrry good cast. Robin Williams ( 26 year old Alan Parrish ), Jonathan Hyde ( Sam Parrish/ Van Pelt ) and Bonnie Hunt ( Sarah Whittle in 1995 ) are the best members of the cast. From the moment the fun starts ( I mean, when they start playing the game ) it never ends. To be honest, the animals in this movie were almost real and I sometimes check my closet before I go to bed. You never know what could be in there... Here's what I think: the special effects deserve 10/10, the cast gets 9/10 so I think the movie must get 9,5/10. Now go and find 'Jumanji'! Wonderful adventure; My opinion: Do not underrate this movie that much. I didn't particularly like it - in fact I almost forgot about it for many years - but the story is simply very, very smart. The idea behind the plot is utter genius. Okay, the actual transformation did not work perfectly, but I insist that it was still a straight accomplishment that had 1. a nice cast, 2. sustainable visual effects and achievements, 3. a great story, 4. both funny and entertaining sequences, that even made you pause and think sometimes, which I regard as a major attainment of any movie. So - I'll give it a solid 7, which it deserves at least. a game not like the other ones; \"Jumanji\" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game \"jumanji\" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy. An excellent family entertainment achievement, with the keyword family, not just kids.; The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children's book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die! Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter  I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families.  \n",

                                                                                               Grumpier Old Men Too Sedate *; While Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were an excellent team, they bombed in this film but good. What's so grumpy about Lemmon in this film? The prequel was much better. Ann Guilbert, as Sophia Loren's mother, is given little to do. Remember her as the grandmother to \"The Nanny?\" Sophia Loren, other than marrying Matthau, is also give nothing to do. Ditto for Ann-Margret, Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak, all of whom were so good in the original but are reduced to practically nothing here. I also resent Matthau, who shows off his part-Jewish heritage marrying in a church at the end. I found this to be offensive. Sorry, but that's the way I am-old fashioned. To all those criticize me for the last statement, how would you have felt if the Matthau-Loren nuptials had taken place in a synagogue? While I realize that this was a comedy, this still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. A non-religious setting would have been the only solution to this. Grumpy, but not funny; What, I wonder, does the legendary Billy Wilder think of this film starring Lemmon and Matthau, the great team he so memorably paired in 1966's \"The Fortune Cookie\"?  Wilder's film is a dark, cynical satire, and was the first of what is now seven films starring the pair.  Seven films, but only two of them--\"The Fortune Cookie\" and \"The Odd Couple\"--are genuinely funny efforts showcasing these actors' combined talents.  \"Grumpy Old Men\" was mildly amusing due less to the script than to the welcome return of Lemmon and Matthau who hadn't been on screen together in 12 years.  The unexpected box-office bonanza naturally inspired a sequel, but all this equally lucrative outing has in its favor is a brief monologue by Burgess Meredith who, as Lemmon's 95-year-old father, boasts of eating bacon and smoking Camels while the \"experts\" who warned against such vices are taking a \"dirt nap.\"  Not even Lemmon and Matthau can enliven the script by Mark Steven Johnson this time around.  The curmudgeonly Matthau admitted he didn't lke the script for the first film but did it to work with Lemmon, and that the only reason he did the sequel is because the first film was a hit.  No doubt, \"Grumpiest Old Men,\" the inevitable sequel, will be just as dreary. If these pictures make big bucks, why tamper with the formula?  Why hire Billy Wilder to punch up the quality when the public seems content merely to see Lemmon and Matthau rather than see them at their best? Who would have ever guessed that it's the same place?; For the most part, \"Grumpier Old Men\" is pretty silly. Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still at each other's throats when Italian immigrant Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in town and throws everything into flux. What actually struck me most about the movie was how different the town looked in this one from the original. Obviously, it was a different time of year, but maybe the different look was meant to show how everything might be changing in the town. Other than that, Ann-Margret returns as Ariel, and she's still as free-spirited and vivacious as she was in the original. Burgess Meredith - in his final role - is still the grandfather who can exercise absolute authority over the youngsters, although he now has the hots for Maria's mother (Ann Morgan Guilbert, aka Millie on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\"). Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah also reprise their roles from the original...ah, and there's that fish. All in all, a fairly interesting movie. Not any kind of masterpiece, but it showed that Lemmon and Matthau still had it. Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. after you have seen the first there is no point seeing this one; After the fun of watching Lemmon and Matthau act like kids for less than 2 hours (i.e. from the first movie) I was satisfied, but then due to the success of the first movie the producers decided to give it another twirl, this time the story had the two starting off as friends thanks to the incidents that happened in the ending of the first film, but then some really really idiotic stupid reason, they were at it again. The movie was not funny as it was like a replay of the first, same pranks, similar plot and screenplay made this movie a waste of time. After getting a mate for John, they (the producers) decided to get a mate for Max, with nothing to write home about but a lame script that just showed no finesse or true plan, just the producers hoping to bank on the success of the previous movie. The main disappointment in the movie for me was Sophia Loren; her acting was just too weak for me to understand that she is a star. Everybody else in the movie even Burgess Meredith (who had Alzheimer's disease and this was his last motion picture appearance) was impressive, at least that I can give them. The movie is directed this time by Howard Deutch, who later worked with the duo in 1998 for Odd Couple II, Deutch other movies also have not been well received like Getting Even with Dad (1994) and The Whole Ten Yards (2004), which are basically the reason why I will not bother seeing My Best Friend's Girl. The movie plot carries on 6 months after the incidents of the first, where both John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) were getting prepared for the wedding of their children. Then a new arrival in town a beautiful lady by the name of Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) came in to change things by turning the towns bait shop to a restaurant. John and Max join forces to try and run the new lady out of town, but the issues between John and Max's children marriage plan caused both to reignite their feud as both refused to believe that their child was at fault. Only the ladies are alive till today (February 2013), as both Lemmon and Matthau died like half a decade after this movie release. Grumpier Old Men was a box office success in its own part, but a huge critical disappointment, as the movie cost 10 million dollars less than its predecessor and made like a million more in the box office. After you have seen the first there is basically no point why you should bother seeing this one, because it will stand in my mind as one movie I credit as a waste of time and talent. www.lagsreviews.com forget the fussing; As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Funnier than the first!; This movie is downright hilarious with tons of good one-liners. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (may they both rest in peace) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max & John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says \"Holy moly\" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor! Sophia, twenty years later at 80, is still spectacular.; I saw a picture of Sophia on her eightieth birthday, demurely covering herself with a sheet and a heart-melting smile. All I could think of was the scene where she hitched up her bra and marched through the bar, and every man looked, and I do mean every man. I read later that she had \"improved\" the script for that. A reviewer in the SF Chronicle wrote later that she said she had had no \"touch- ups\", and if so then \"her genes need investigating.\" I remember her many films where her beauty was so natural that it was a wonder any man could concentrate on his lines. She never traded on it, but on her talent as an actress. Carlo Ponti was a lucky man: beauty without guile, talent without pretense. Italian pizza were like street food. When she heard we had so many pizza parlors, she thought we must be a poor country. Then she visited, and dined on American pizza. She reconsidered, gracefully and graciously. A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances...; A sequel to the thoroughly enjoyable Grumpy Old Men, 'Grumpier Old Men' is A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances. The sequel has the spirit of its prequel & the amazing cast, led by the impeccable talents of the Late/Great Jack Lemmon & the Late/Great Walter Matthau, are in full form! 'Grumpier Old Men' Synopsis: John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. 'Grumpier Old Men' works well as a romantic-comedy, as it has moments of humour & subtle romance. I loved the prequel & I must say, the sequel doesn't fail to deliver. The film has sustained its energy & wit, that one would expect from it. Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is entertaining, although initially the pace is slightly slow. Howard Deutch's Direction is top-class. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is good. Editing also is ably done. Performance-Wise: Lemmon & Matthau shine all through. Its their sheer on-screen chemistry, that alone is worth watching the entire film. Sophia Loren is top-notch. Ann-Margret is impressive. Kevin Pollak & Daryl Hannah leave a mark. Late/Great Burgess Meredith is memorable in his part. On the whole, 'Grumpier Old Men' is a smooth, relaxing watch. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10 Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from 1995. The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe 8yrs old, and must have seen it over 100 x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it 15 minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in 1995, 2 years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie 8 out of 10. Mini Ha Has In Minnesota; It's just possible that the intention was to shoot four Grumpy Old Men titles featuring the four seasons because after the Winter setting of the first one we are now in Summer though theoretically such a cycle should have begun with Spring and ended with Winter so maybe the cyclical thing was an afterthought. Whatever we have virtually the same cast doing virtually the same thing with one absentee and two replacements one of which, Anna Guilbert is actually a native of Minneapolis adding a touch of authenticity. If it was unrealistic that Ann Margaret - who, after all, was teaching English at university and would by definition have access to dozens of eligible males - would marry Jack Lemmon in the first film it is equally unrealistic that Sophia Loren would wed Walter Mattheau here other than for feelgood reasons. On the other hand it's probably churlish to nitpick in this way when the film is only intended to entertain. Which it does. great; This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa As Good As The Original; Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\". I don't agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love \"Buddy Buddy\" and \"The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile. very funny.; This film has some of the funniest lines and it's a great comedy. One would probably think, even I, thought that this would probably happen between two older men who fight about the obvious: women, fish and each other. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are a perfect pair. Even though it's a comedy, the romance in it is on the clean side. Nothing too distasteful and the comic relief is still included into the romance, which gives it a continuous comic flow. Even though there is a serious part of the film where John's father passes away, after that scene the film is back to the comic feel, which is nice because there's no dwelling on the sad/serious scene. Nonetheless, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh hard. Sweet and Sad; In this bright sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\" we find John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) at it again. The rivalry never stops. This time, they are bickering over their children's nuptials, almost causing a wedding not to occur. Sophia Loren co-stars as Maria in this foray into the land of 10,000 lakes as the new girl in town that Max has an eye for. At first, they both hate one another because she is turning his beloved tackle shop into a restaurant. Comedy ensues as Max and John both try to get the restaurant shut down and condemned. Eventually, as in the first film, love finds a way. However, sadness veils over as well when Burgess Meredith's character dies. Other than that, the film is very enjoyable. Cute sequel that works; Fun story of two older men who never quite outgrew boyhood, and the ladies they love. What a treat to see two master actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, working with silly material and enjoying every minute of it. The lady loves, Ann Margret and the ever-sexy and dazzling Sophia Loren, do equally well with a lightweight, sometimes over-the-top script. The principals are aided by a uniformly fine supporting cast, including Burgess Meredith as the Lemmon character's outrageously lecherous dad, and Ann Morgan Guilbert as Sophia's feisty mama. The older players' interaction is a delight. My only quibble with this film is the fact that Meredith's character dies without getting married like everyone else. Why? I wondered whether Meredith had perhaps expired during filming, but, according to Wikipedia, the actor lived a whole two years following this movie's release! The original film, \"Grumpy Old Men,\" takes place during a picturesque Minnesota winter, with snow used to charming effect. The follow-up capitalizes on a Midwestern summer. Like apples and oranges, both productions satisfy. the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. 2/5 stars - John Ulmer Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! The good, the bad, and the just plain miserable...again; It's not uncommon for a movie sequel to do little to the formula that made its predecessor so financially (and hopefully critically) successful. The old \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" method of filmmaking has been used in the Hangover, Home Alone, and Taken franchise to only modest success in terms of quality. However, in Grumpier Old Men, the sequel to the fine comedy Grumpy Old Men, handles the rehashed formula better than many film sequels do. While I'm getting to sound repetitive and out of descriptive words, this is largely because of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's chemistry together on-screen. From the moment they appear, it's almost impossible to believe the men's friendship in real life wasn't lifelong and consisted largely of playful torment, vulgarity, and several boys nights out. Had the film been a sequel with few returning cast members (say Lemmon and Matthau were substituted by two other actors), this sequel would've likely been a somber affair to view. In a way, I'm thankful the town of Wabasha Minnesota hasn't really changed much since our last outing, with the exception of John Gustafson (Jack Lemon) marrying Ariel (Ann-Margret) from the original film. In the meantime, John's dad still lives off a diet of beer, cigarettes, and bacon and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), John's cantankerous neighbor, still finds himself engaging in petty neighborhood battles with John about outwitting the other man. However, the big ordeal this time is not competing for a new neighbor's love but trying to save a local bait shop from becoming a \"restaurante\" for Italian cuisine. The restaurant is managed by Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren), a gorgeous but uncompromisingly strict woman who catches the eye of Max even as him and Jack plan to foil the restaurant's forthcoming prosperity. Other events (aka subplots) occurring in Wabasha are the wedding between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah), a plot which would later be used by the same director Howard Deutch in The Odd Couple II, also starring Lemmon and Matthau, along with John trying to get his father (Burgess Meredith in his final role, which was burdened by spouts with Alzheimer's and difficultly remembering lines, some female company as he gets older. One of Grumpier Old Men's immediate issues is that there is simply too much going on between plot-strands that involve marriage/romance troubles (I counted four including John's brief trouble with Ariel later in the movie) ad others that involve trying to sabotage the bait-shop-turned-restaurant. Grumpier Old Men may have too many new ideas for cutesy subplots, but it keeps the tone and feel of its predecessor alive and well. It still feels like Wabasha is the location of a sitcom with its oddball situations that seem to consistently bear hefty consequences for its residents, but its characters still feel like real people we've come to known and care about. Unsurprisingly, Lemmon and Matthau share unbelievable conversational beauty in the way they engage in simple discussions that seem to constantly end in uproariously funny bickering. Once you minimize your focus on that aspect in the film, you have just an average comedy that, while charming and pleasantly safe (a good and bad quality for this particular kind of picture), is just grateful to be buoyed by two very talented leading men. Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Sophia Loren, and Burgess Meredith. Directed by: Howard Deutch. A vibrant sequel that's still underwhelming; I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They seem to work perfectly together, and with a better script, this movie could be gold. We are taken back to Minnesota to re-visit the old grumps who now have to plan a wedding for their very plain and very boring children. There's a reason Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah have never had substantial film careers- they're very uninteresting actors. But I digress. If \"Grumpy Old Men\" built up it's laughs, \"Grumpier Old Men\" topples them down. The best moments of both films are when Lemmon and Matthau trade vicious insults at one another, and also play pranks on each other. But when this is taken away, we're suffering every old cliché in the book, including Walter's tiresome 'Wholey Moley' line which is used so much, it could be taken into context for a Shot Party (take a shot every time Matthau 'Wholey Moley''s himself). The other problem with this series is the fact that gorgeous women fall for these two farts. Roger Ebert made a very valid point in his review for this film- first Ann-Margaret moves into the neighborhood and marries Jack Lemmon. Now the even more gorgeous Sophia Loren has set her sights on the incredibly unattractive Matthau. And why? For concepts in the plot. There's no reason a woman as beautiful and intelligent as Loren would fall for the dull and disgusting figure Matthau is. I know this is a comedy, but come on now! All in all this sequel is peppier and a little more fun then the original, but both movies suffer from overblown dramatic passages that are not needed. We want to see the old guys go at it, not Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah. I laughed a lot at this movie- mostly at the incredibly underrated Bergis Meredith as the foul-mouthed Grandpa. Since all three main actors have passed, we'll never see them again. At least Margaret and Loren are still alive and kicking. I'd love to see their movie: \"Grumpy Old Widows\". The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5. Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. not much fun; Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still combative while maintaining their truce. John is married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) now and his father (Burgess Meredith) is still spry. Everybody is chasing after the big fish Catfish Hunter. Meanwhile, their children Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are planning to get married. Newcomer Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in Wabasha to buy the bait shop and turn it into an Italian restaurant. It's a continuation that's missing much of the fun. It is contrived. It's great to see these great actors working together but that's all I got out of it. I found very few laughs. Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. Back For More!; CONTAINS SPOILERS John Gustafson and Max Goldman are back in their first adventure since their last. It's six months later and they're still fishing. All the snow has melted and the neighborhood looks very different. The boys are out to catch a giant legendary fish they've heard tell about.          These men would soon discover big changes happening. Like, their friend Chuck, who died in the last adventure, had operated the bait shop. Ever since his demise, it's been empty, but some people have come with plans to turn it into a ristorante (restaurant). They are: Mama Regetti and daughter Maria. John and Max don't want that to happen so they pull numerous pranks on the Regettis but they still won't leave.         Jacob Goldman and Melanie Gustafson contemplate matrimony. But have their doubts when their fathers insist on planning the event. But when the kids decide the wedding is off, John and Max are back at it. Pulling all sorts of foolish pranks on one another. Max steals John's outboard motor, John wrecks Max's fish net and has his cat scratch up Max's car seats, but Max sends a big dog through John's house. Ariel decides to leave for a while. John was in a real pickle. He tried asking his father for advice, but he had passed away; Max goes on a date with Maria and they decide they like one another.        Pretty soon, it's a wedding day. En route to the church, Max and John decide to fish for the giant musket they're so fond of. They catch it, but John says they must leave it in the lake out of respect for his father, so they do and rush to church. It looks like the wedding of Jacob and Melanie, but it isn't. They eloped. It's the wedding of Max and Maria. John planted Max's dog in the limo as they drive off.        Was this as good as the first? Sure. I'm sorry to say that the three main stars, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith are no longer with us. Meredith died in 1998, Matthau in 2000 and Lemmon in 2001, which is real sad. So it's guarenteed there will never be an Even Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple III. They were really funny men. Why do the good ones always gotta die? But anyway, if you're a fan of these men and you enjoyed the first one, then I recommend Grumpier Old Men! - Still having a good ol' time!; I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men back to back, so I could see both instead of my normal rent one sequel at a time ordeal. I just finished Grumpier Old Men this morning and was expecting a modest sequel, but it turned into a great sequel, pretty much to the point where I enjoyed Grumpier Old Men to Grumpy Old Men. Despite the fact that they use some old jokes, this was a fun plot and I thought the guys have gotten even funnier, including John's father, he's a little dirty, but so much fun to laugh at. John and Max are now best friends again and couldn't be happier with each other, their son and daughter are about to get hitched, and they are overwhelming with the wedding plans. Max is starting to get lonely though, since Chuck has passed on, the bait shop is given to two older Italian women, one lady, Maria, starts a little feud with Max wanting to turn the bait shop into a restaurant. But their anger turns into a hidden passion and they end up falling head over heals for each other, but Maria has some hidden skeletons in her closet. Grumpier Old Men is proof that you are never too old to fall in love or have your heart broken again. It was so sweet seeing Max fall in love with Maria, I loved their passion for each other, it was so fun to watch. John's father and Maria's mother were just so awesome and funny, they had such great chemistry! I would highly recommend Grumpier Old Men, it's a great comedy that once again touches your heart and tickles your funny bone. 8/10 1/10; this movie sucked! I hate it! It's so boring! The acting is so bad! Why does Sophia Loren's italian character talk english to her italian mother when they're alone? The script is so bad! It's so corny! Max and John fighting with the fishing things is so silly! This movie was never funny! It was painful to watch, i'm telling you! Avoid it! Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter & Jack's previous films together. It was this film & the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max & John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life & Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau & Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman & John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a 7.4 out of 10 Snoozing sequel with the leads in need of some No-Doz; Woeful, disappointing sequel to 1993's hit \"Grumpy Old Men\" is more retread than follow-up. The two crotchety neighbors--Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--bicker over their children (who will soon be making the sparring oldsters in-laws!) and, of course, who has the better fishing skills. They stop trading insults long enough for Matthau to begin irritating a new woman in town, a fiery Italian who has just opened her own restaurant. Sitcom humor with a sometimes-raunchy twist that is no longer fresh. Almost worth-seeing for Sophia Loren's funny, lively performance, but everyone else looks a little sleepy. Ann-Margret (who married Lemmon's character at the end of the original) must've dropped in for a day and a half to complete her work. As the youthful couple, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah are also under-used. ** from **** As equally funny as the original, but with an Italian flair!!!!; This sequel to Grumpy Old Men is as funny as the original. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and the rest of the cast from the original movie reprise their roles. John and Max are still feuding, but the tension between them has softened. There are, however, some changes: Ariel and John are married and there's a new girl in town named Maria Ragetti. She's moved to Wabasha to open up an Italian restaurant at the former Chuck's Bait place. When the boys discover what Maria's intentions are, they hatch a scheme to ruin the grand opening of the restaurant and try to keep Chuck's business going, even though the inventory of the former business has been cleared out and the interior remodeled to look like an Italian restaurant. Max and Sophia meet, but there's a disagreement about what the place should be. Maria goes to the neighborhood bar to try and reason with Max, but to no avail. It seems as though Max and John have trouble saying goodbye to what is no longer there. The humor between Lemmon and Matthau's characters is still spiced up and is still able to put viewers in stitches. Then, Max and Maria get married, and the restaurant starts selling bait, as well. Great movie, great cast, great fun!! Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) funny funny; I, too, found the film very funny and until reading about it here couldn't remember who played the other woman with Burgess Meredith at the end of the film, the scene that made the whole film complete.  Without giving away what happened at the end of the film, the other woman was that gorgeous elder lady of many great films - Sophia Loren.  What a delicious surprise!  Good also for any old grumpy man! Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. 7/10 stars. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT 7 out of 10 \"Good Lemmon & Matthau Comedy Sequel!\"; Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Kevin Pollack, Daryl Hannah and Burgess Meredith star in this 1995 comedy sequel. This takes place about 6 months later where John (Lemmon) is now married to Ariel (Margret) and he and Max (Matthau) are sort of getting along. This time, Max finds romance when he meets Maria Ragetti (Loren), an Italian widow who moves into town and opens a restaurant. Jacob (Pollack) and Melanie (Hannah) are also engaged and things start to get a bit difficult for them which makes their dads feud with each other, but only temporarily. The late, Meredith (Rocky) also returns as John's father and this was his final film. This is a good sequel and like the first film, it provides laughs and a bit of heartfelt moments as well. I recommend this. Oh, How The Mighty Have Fallen...; GRUMPY OLD MEN (3 outta 5 stars) GRUMPIER OLD MEN (2 outta 5 stars) I dunno why I even bothered to watch the second one. Oh, I guess because it was on cable TV shown as a double bill with the original \"Grumpy Old Men\". I liked the original when I first saw it. It was not the best work by the Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau team... but it had its moments... these two actors could probably read pages from the phone book to each other and still make it funny. Unfortunately, the sequel has even FEWER of those moments. Still, I maintain that no movie with either Lemmon OR Matthau in it can be *totally* worthless. This is probably as close as they ever got, though. (Bear in mind that I have not yet seen their last movie together, \"The Odd Couple II\".) Practically the same plot as the first movie... Lemmon and Matthau play lifelong acquaintances and next door neighbors who are constantly bickering about fish and/or women. Burgess Meredith plays Lemmon's FATHER... and if you find old people talking dirty hilarious then you'll probably love his scenes (especially in the closing credits outtakes). Ann Margaret and Sophia Loren play the women in the grumpy guys' lives... hard to imagine that women as attractive as they still are would want anything to do with these two old dorks but, hey... I guess pickings are slim after 65. Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. A sequel that's equal to the original comedy; The first go round was such a hit, that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau got together for this sequel to the 1993 smash hit, \"Grumpy Old Men.\" And \"Grumpier Old Men\" is every bit as good as the first film. It has some new characters and the scene changes from winter to summer, then winter and spring. Most reviewers don't talk about the surprise of the wedding in the first film. And I won't do that for that film or this one. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) team up for a time in the movie to plan the wedding of their daughter and son, Melanie and Jacob (played by Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak). And, later, to try to thwart the conversion of their bait shop into an Italian restaurant. Sophia Loren is the added ingredient for much humor as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti. She's a cousin of \"Spaghetti\" Ragetti, whom John and Max know. Her mother is in the picture, Mama Ragetti, played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. And, grandpa Gustafson is back, with Burgess Meredith now a couple years older. He tells son, John, as they sit by the lake drinking beer, that he sometimes thinks God has forgotten about him. The hijinks and capers in this film include some hilarious pranks the two friendly enemies pull on the Ragettis. As with the original film, this one supposedly takes place in Wabasha, Minnesota. While it is a real town on the Mississippi River border with Wisconsin, the filming for this and the earlier movie was done in a number of places around that area of southeastern Minnesota. So, anyone going to Wabasha won't find the fishing lake, the town overlook or some other scenes shown in these films. With the 10 films they made together  especially the nine comedies, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have delighted audiences for decades. May they outlive Catfish Hunter and continue amuse people for decades to come. OLDER, HORNIER AND STILL FRUSTRATED IN MINNESOTA;  `Grumpier Old Men' is a film that is a sequel to `Grumpy Old Men.' Reprising their original roles are Jack Lemmon as John Gustafson, Walter Matthau as Max Goldman, Ann Margaret as Ariel, Burgess Meredith as John's father, Kevin Pollock and Darryl Hannah as the children of Max and John. They are still next-door neighbors, only now the feud has subsided. Their children are living across the street in Ariel's house.  The marriage of their children is on the horizon. The setting for this film is summer and fall in Minnesota.  Fishing is still the main sport where `Catfish Hunter' is still the elusive prize.  The bait shop on the lake has been closed since Chuck passed away.  It is now under new management.  John and Max are anxiously waiting the reopening.  To their surprise, it is not being reopened as a bait shop, but a ristorante (restaurant).  Here enters Sophia Loren as the new proprietress Maria Sophia Calotti Ragetti.  Ann Guilbert who plays her mother joins her.  When Max and John find out the new plans for their favorite bait shop, they set out to undermine her plans for a grand opening.  A series of misunderstandings set off a domino effect that touches everyone's lives.  New loves are found and an old feud is rekindled. All of the same emotions that were in the previous film are in this film. There is laughter, sadness, anger and happiness.  Catfish Hunter makes his film debut, which, in essence, puts a `face' with a name.  His film appearance pays credence to the fact that he is a `real' fish and not just a myth.   The acting in this film is superb both by human and non-human.  The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down. Loren is still hot; Grumpy old men was an OK comedy with a nice performance by Ann-Margret, but otherwise forgettable. This film, on the other hand, has some real comic touches that actually also have something to say about the aging process - and life really doesn't end until it ends. But first the bad news: Daryl Hannah. I've liked her in other films, but she is so flat in this, she's a distraction. She doesn't have the feel for these characters, not even her own, and so doesn't quite fit. She's not even credible as the mother of the young girl who is so important in her relationship to great=grand-dad Burgess Meredith. There must have been some plot device they could have come up with to leave her out of the picture altogether; oh, well. Now the really good news: Sophia Loren. I admit I have always had a crush on her since I saw Houseboat as a kid; and when I saw the shower scene in Arabesque, i couldn't sleep for a week. Her performance here is splendid (romantic comedy is one of her strengths, after all), but the really really good news is that she was past sixty when she made this film, and she looks hot enough to burn a young man's fingers! Really - if I'd been Walter Matthau in that bar scene, I'd have gone out with a heart-attack right there - and smiling. With an adequate script, and such superb actors, Deutsch wisely lets the formula roll on without interference. Consequently, whatever the short-comings there's plenty to remember fondly from this film. Oh, and don't miss the blooper-reel that runs under the final credits - Matthau and Meredith are having a grand old time. Oh, and Sophia Loren is still hot. Grumpier Old Men (1995) **1/2; More of the same for those who enjoyed the first film, nothing great but a decent time killer. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return in their twilight years as the ever-battling duo, but this time with the added attraction of Sophia Loren who still looks gorgeous at age 60. She winds up posing a threat to their favorite bait and tackle shop when she decides to take it over and turn it into an Italian restaurant. Since Lemmon's already got sexy Ann-Margret as his hot girlfriend, Sophia hits it off with old man Matthau (ah, the magic of movies), who does not look as good for his age (75). Burgess Meredith is better used in this one in his role as Lemmon's naughty old pop. **1/2 out of **** charming and funny light romantic comedy; It may be just me but I found Grumpier Old Men way way better than Grumpy Old Men. I laughed more and got involved in the plot much more. That it is totally 100% predictable every step of the way is only one of its charms... its how you get there where the fun is. And these actors turn in surprisingly memorable performances for such a slight film. I thought Sophia Loren turned in one of her most charming and funny performances, as did everyone else. The story was just more interesting and three dimensional than the first film and flowed more organically. The story line is simple ancient classic romantic comedy that these veterans had done so many times, it seemed for them like doing a well-known dance. The fun is not in surprises but in going through the old steps with joy. The actors move through their paces with simplicity and enthusiasm and the film actually captures very well the effects of love. The whole film hangs together and works in a way that, for me, the first one didn't. It gets airborne. It deserves a higher ranking than my seven except the story is a little too well-worn. It also allows the two protagonists to get a little more real with each other. Even the three charismatic animal actors get caught up in the spirit of fun. One thing about the film that gave me trouble was that all four women being courted in the film are talented, accomplished, strong and magnificent while all four of the men are hamstrung. I found it mysterious that these women, dropped by some miracle into this tiny town, would be so strongly attracted. Pretty Dang Funny; John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. We often expect sequels to be weaker than the original. But sometimes we may be pleasantly surprised. In this sequel, the \"grumpy old men\" are still up to their old tricks, going after each other and teaming up to close down a restaurant. Some of it may be a bit far-fetched (in real life, a store owner would get the cops involved) but it's good fun. Sadly, the film has the distinction of being Burgess Meredith's final film. On the plus side, he really goes out with a bang. His acting and delivery of witty lines is top notch, and the film does a great job of hiding his Alzheimer's. You can really feel the talent in his character. It has it's moments; Howard Deutch decided he wanted to cash in on the success of Grumpy Old Men and it worked. The only problem to the sequel is that some of the cast seem to be a bit bored by the proceedings. The one liners are enough to make you drop your popcorn. Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon are a joy to watch as they continue to find ways to drive each other over the edge into insanity. And yet Deutch calms that insanity by giving us a quick glimpse into just how much these two men mean to each other when Jack's dad played by Burgess Meredith dies. Lemmon and Mathau are still at the top of their game in this film. In this film the Ann Margaret character is suppose to be the rock, the sound of reason, the calm in the midst of the storm. You believe she is until she has the insanity thrust upon her and is forced to react. For the most part Ann Margaret as well as Daryl Hannah seem bored throughout the entire film. Kevin Pollack is just as good in this sequel as in the original. Burgess Meredith is the scene stealer, he manages with dead pan accuracy to deliver some of the best one liners in the film. Ann Morgan Guilbert manages to match Burgess with her ability to respond to his one liners with shock and outrage befitting her character. And then you come to Sophia. Sophia is in her comfort zone here. Sophia is comfortable with the slapstick comedy and relishes it, she's in the movie, she's not walking through it. She's absolutely stunning to watch but at the same time she adds to the moment. She's as glamorous as ever but it doesn't get in the way. All in all a good follow up to the original. Good Laughs; Grumpier Old Men (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to Grumpy Old Men have Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau returning with more fights and foul language. This time out Lemmon is still happily married but Matthau is on the move and takes a special interest in an Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved to town. I think the most remarkable thing about this film is how well Loren looked. Even at 61 she's still a head turner and her comic timing isn't too bad either. I'm sure this film was only made because the first one made money but it doesn't really matter as no one should take this too serious as it's just a silly comedy meant to make you laugh. There are plenty of nice laughs here but I don't think it's as good as the original. This certainly isn't in the league as The Odd Couple but we do get a pretty good throwback to that film here as there's a scene where Lemmon has to spend the night with Matthau but can't put up with his dirty house. Ann-Margret returns but is pretty much wasted as is Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak. The perverted Burgess Meredith is back and steals the scene every time he's in it. Both Matthau and Lemmon are naturally very good and they easily slip back into their roles. It's priceless watching the two men work together even when the material isn't as strong as one would hope. Lemmon gets a special notice here due to a very touching scene with Meredith. Another problem is the direction, which has one of those \"made for TV\" feels to it. In the end this film could have and should have been a lot better but the cast make it worth watching. Delightful acting and script but silly scenes...; Always delighting in Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, warmed by their aging and childish pranks, I enjoyed this film which is filled with delightful acting and fun script.It suffers, however,  from more than a few silly scenes. Great!; This is a rare sequel. Wait a minute, sequels aren't rare. Well, that's true, but a *good* sequel is rare. Most of the time, sequels aren't even in the same league as the originals. However, due to excellent writing, a superb cast and great direction, this film is every bit as enjoyable as Grumpy Old Men. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made several films together and they worked together extremely well. The gorgeous Ann Margaret reprises her role from the first film and is now Lemmon's wife. A new lady hits town and Matthau is very interested. This lovely creature is played by Sophia Loren, who is still stunningly beautiful. Burgess Meredith is great as Grandpa. The stellar cast ensures great acting. However, this film is also written such that there is literally a laugh nearly every minute. I found the film to be highly enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh. Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the 1st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. One of the best movies of 1995!; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Is it better than original?; Is this movie better than the original? Perhaps. It's probably funnier than the original. Walter Matthau's pick-up line is one of the funniest things of the movie. But is it better than the original? The original had more of the emotions of Lemmon and Matthau as they fought. This one has less feuding (but still has some of the old pranks) and more focus on the family / dating relationships of the old men. This movie is funny and definitely worth watching. You'll have to decide on your own if it's better than the original.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Excellent for the broken heart...; Perhaps the reason they call this movie a chick flick, is because that's exactly who it's aimed at. Women. I don't see this as a man bashing movie, but more as a \"how do you deal?\" type of movie. It covers every situation: The unworthy co-worker, The drug-addict boyfriend, the gay husband, the cheating husband, the married man, the New Years fling, the sweet attractive neighbor, the teenage son....but most importantly, it show how women react and deal with the lies, the cheating, and the friendships between both men AND women...and how to survive from that. Any woman who has ever gone through a relationship can relate to this movie, regardless of race, situation, or age. You will want to scream, cry and laugh throughout the whole movie, and I can guarantee that every woman has got a little Angela Bassett in her, especially when she rips through her ex-husbands belongings. Two thumbs up...A definite must-see for any woman with a wounded heart. This film does Terry McMillan's writing no justice; This movie had great potential had it landed in the right directors hands (as seen with How Stella got Her Groove Back).  Many rough cuts, sloppy editing, and terrible lighting at times to name a few.  Casting was excellent with the exception of Whitney Houston who has the tendency to over-chew her scenes.  Though much of the book was not adapted to the film the strength and love amongst four friends was apparent.  It was the one thing that was not lost or left on the cutting room floor.  Good movie, better book. Waiting to Exhale (the movie) ***** (5 stars) Waiting to Exhale (the novel) ********** (ten stars) FAbuLOuS; Simply fabulous. I thought it was a great movie. I was completely empowered! It made me want to start my exes car on fire. Embrace your independence  watch this movie. (is great to watch with the scorned over glasses of wine and bon bons) It'll make you laugh, cry, get mad, and then plot getting even. I can waste a lot of your time telling you to see it, defending it from what others say about it, or just generally talking it up. But haven't you always wanted to see Angela Basset throw a fit? How bout cut her hair off? And who wouldn't want to watch Whitney act with humility. This is by far my favorite movie with Whitney - second, The Bodyguard - third, The Preachers Wife. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Pathetic; This film is simply about a bunch of women who pick men who's behaviors they claim to hate & then spend the rest of their time complaining about them. It seems that this view is held by many women & possibly accounts in some measure to the number of women who consider their relationships with men to be unsatisfying. This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation. Hilarious in Parts; 1995 was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in 1995, the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops & horrible movies. Don't Exhale Just Yet; I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It's not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others, it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However, the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria -- even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger, Holly Hunter, Alfre Woodard and others. Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight, insecure no-nonsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight, but she was the only one who found it (and deserved it). She was the only one who didn't sleep around, wasn't a man basher, set a good example for her son, and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face -- look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things, her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent, good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie. Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package --- beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life - she could now start her catering business, she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end. Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book, you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men. Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same -- Whitney Houston being well groomed, pretending to be well spoken and classy, and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise (although she might have been too young). The character had to tell us she was smart -- in a phone conversation with her mother she said \"I'm smart, I'm a good person and I work hard.\" Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills, doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end. This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn't \"tell this story\" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were. Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue? Double Standard; So I finally got around to watching \"Waiting to Exhale\" on Encore the other night and I don't understand why this became a hit. (Note: spoilers ahead) As far as I can tell, the basic premise of this film is that all men are insensitive, callous and unfeeling; especially towards women. Okay, well and good. That is the storyline? Fine. Men suck, got it. But there is a huge double standard here; two of the women are dating married men and clearly, we are meant to be sympathetic about their plight as they whine and cry about not having \"their\" man with them at night in bed. How about this? STOP DATING MARRIED MEN! Maybe that's your problem in the first place. Now, on the flip side, Angela Basset's character is abandoned by her husband for another woman. Yet, if you pay attention, even this character is not completely innocent. When her husband informs her he is leaving, the things she says makes it clear she's known about his lover(s) for years but ignored his infidelities. Why? Obviously, because he's so wealthy. She liked all the \"stuff\" a little too much to have confronted him about it. Again, she's made her bed here, not as completely as the two who are actively cheating, but still. She spends the rest of the movie being so angry that he left her you never really grow to like her. Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer; he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar. With their clothes on, which apparently means it's oh-so-platonic and sweet. Then he writes her a letter months later, thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off, he'll contact her again. Did anyone else think this was more than a little sleazy? I would hope if I were dying of breast cancer that my husband wasn't out sleeping around (and I do mean just sleeping) with other women. Sweet, platonic, whatever; I think it's pretty horrible. Bottom line; the characters you're supposed to connect to are unlikable and the ones you're supposed to hate are just pathetic. Not very enjoyable. However, I did give it three stars for the music, which didn't suck too badly and the clothes and style. It's a nice little snapshot of how things looked in '95. And the print wasn't very faded. That's about it, though. Extra in Movie; I was actually an extra in this movie and had a quite a fun time hanging out w/the cast/crew. I had an opportunity to be at several of the locations for days of filming and it was a lot of work. You don't realize what a day of filming entitles until you actually do it and I was just an extra. I was more interested in the process of the film making than being on camera so it was a great opportunity. I even got \"spoiled\" and met a lot of the cast and drove around in the SUV's that are for the main cast...fun stuff! I think over all the movie was to enjoy for fun. I think the basis of the friendships were the most important aspect of the film. That through all the craziness of men in their lives they were still there for one another. This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Good movie, Better book; This wasn't a bad movie. The acting was great (although Whitney Houston still seems mediocre). Some of the scenes were powerful and funny. However, unlike the book which also deals with the sisterhood of Black women, the movie becomes a long \"Men are pigs\" tirade that gets weary after a while. Plus it's sometimes hard to root for the characters. For instance, considering all the one-night stands Savannah has, it's hard to see why she's questioning her ability to find a good man. Overall, Waiting to Exhale, is basically a sorely-needed bonding movie for African-American women that, while a little biased, is good escapist fun. Sticky; There was nothing in the movie that made me excited. The message did not come through,  if there was one. Perhaps it is to convey the idea that men are useless,  or that relations are complicated because women make it complicated. If a comedy,  I did not laugh.  If a drama,  I did not find it dramatic. It was like drinking a cup of coffee presented to you with way too much sugar. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. Whitney ruined the great potential; Angela Basset was good as expected, but Whitney has no Range as an actress. The screenplay also neglected to portray, on film, the greatness of this novel.  Instead of promoting sisterhood, they emphasized the canine-qualities of men.  Read the book; rent Soul Food instead! Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. I wanna move to Arizona; I thought It was a great movie, although it is a lot of sleeping with other women husband that are taken, we all have to be honest, this goes on a lot in reality. it's not right, but it happens.... Overall I really enjoy the movie because it took me way back to 1995, the movie was great. great times, although I was just 11 when it came out, I remember all the hype over this movie from my mom n my aunts.... One factor that I've never notice before was the setting... It makes me wanna pack up my family an move to peaceful Arizona.. Great Movie. r.i.p. Whitney Houston I cannot believe it took me all this time to see this movie all the way through... Frustrating...; That's the word I'd use to describe the film, an adaptation of Terry McMillan's 1992 best-seller. It's not great, it's not bad, but it's frustrating to watch, and the fact that I'm of the male persuasion undoubtedly had something to do with it. Now, let me be the first to say that I did enjoy seeing a group of strong black women portrayed onscreen. To say that Hollywood has been exceedingly lax in this regard is an understatement. But it would've been nice if their collective talents hadn't been squandered on this disgustingly anti-male tirade. Especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine, who otherwise shine in everything their names are attached to. Good, solid movies about sisterhood are probably needed now more than ever, but not at the cost of shortchanging the good, upright, decent brothers out there, whom this movie largely forgets about (with some notable exceptions -- Gregory Hines, for example.) And the frustration doesn't end there. Both Savannah and Robin manage to find themselves involved with the most shady characters (a married man and a dope fiend, respectively), yet they complain about the lack of good men out there. I suppose it would be silly to question just where they've been looking, even though it might hold the answer. The sad thing is that there are fellas out there who have little to no regard for women (\"the scum of the f__king earth\", to quote Savannah), and women who fall for fellas like that for the most silly, shallow reasons. If it wasn't for Bassett, Devine, and Babyface's score, this movie would barely be watchable. As it is, it's a moderately entertaining diversion, albeit a frustrating one. A 3 is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. great touching story; While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life's mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Great female flick of the '90s!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track 6: This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! A real disaster!; This movie is awful! The caracters are shallow and almost ridiculous, especially Lela Rochon. It's a very, very, very bad soap opera. I was watching this movie with my wife and we were laughing almost all the time. It is much too long, with no rhythm with absolutely no emotions. It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one cliché after another. Skip it, it's a waste of time! The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" My favorite movie ever !; I'm so surprised by the comments i read here. Since i saw that movie maybe 10 years ago now, it's one of my favorite movie ever along with boomerang.Maybe it's because i was fairly young when i watched those movies.. but i find them extremely good. I watched the movie before i read the book and it may be the reason why i loved the movie so much. Sure Whitney's acting could have been better but she managed to do a pretty decent job overall. As for the soundtrack it's a pure bliss for RnB lovers and i would say a classic now. The image of Black men in the movie is very negative but in a sens it pushed to be the exact opposite so it kinda shaped my vision and my life, and \"deepend\" my love of black women. Some parts of the movie are just so classic like the break up between Robin and troy on the balcony and the soundtrack at that moment was some kind of a symphony.. anyways great great movie .. enjoy A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about 15 or 16 and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker. 6 of 10 stars. A bit too soapy but deserves respect for being a positive film for black women; Vannah is travelling to see her friend Bernie while leaving behind all her old live to start anew.  Bernie has just been left by her husband of 13 years for a white woman.  Robin wants to be loved and happy but always makes the wrong choices.  Glo has an estranged husband and the only man in her life is her teenage son.  The four get together through their struggles in love and live as they try to put it all together again. This is very much a woman's film and, as a man, it's easy for me to criticise it for being a weepy or for being a bit of a woman love in, so I won't.  The plot is pure soap opera, the lives and loves of our 4 women, however it is still involving as the four stories all have strengths as well as weaknesses.  The mix of comedy and sentiment is a bit too much 20:80 and at times the sentiment gets too much, but the sassy characters keep the interest. The soapy sentiment isn't helped by a poor soundtrack and poor use there of. In itself I like some of the love ballad r'n'b stuff  but here it felt like it was all over every scene.  This really bogs it down. Also a down side is the whole man hating thing  only a few come off looking good.  I thought the director being a man would help redress the balance but it seemed to have no effect. Why  can someone tell me  was Houston chosen to lead this talented black cast?  Was it because she could do a cut price soundtrack?  She's a poor actress and he spoiled her scenes  she needs to stay in TVM's.  Bassett however is powerful as ever and really steals every single scene she's in.  Devine adds comedy and sauce while Rochon is perfect as the vulnerable beauty going about love the wrong way.  The male cast is great too  there are so many well known faces in this with only two criticisms of them  1  everytime I see Haysbert now all I can think of is his 24 character.  And 2  Wesley Snipes' character just don't convince me at all. Overall to criticise this for being girly or sentimental is to miss the point.  It is actually good to see a film with so many good roles for black actresses.  It's a bit too soapy for my taste but it is funny and involving with a commanding Bassett.  Only Huston, a soppy soundtrack and constant man caricatures spoil it. WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. I give this one 2 out of 10. not bad; this movie and its story are quite good on the whole..........Ms Bassett is the leading and the best actress,for sure.I get her character.she's beautiful and I guess she's blown people away with her beauty and the EASE WITH WHICH SHE FASCINATES.Ms HOUSTON IS NOT TO NEGLECT NEITHER.She looks natural in this one.And despite her little experience as far as her actress career is concerned,she is good even though her story is a bit common .Loretta is divine!Anyways,this motion picture is merely good.There's nothing amazing.And it don't stand out from all the other movies.the only thing that makes me stick to the screen is the complicity and the crude humor on men of the four ladies! Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this 1995 film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. A One-Sided Celebration of African American Feminism; Directed by Forest Whitaker and adapted from a smash best selling novel by Terry McMillan, WAITING TO EXHALE is a glossy, but one-sided look at the relationship between four strong black women and the various men in their lives. The film is one-sided because the screenplay presents most of the male characters as sexist, manipulative pigs without a redeeming characteristic in sight, but the sensitive direction and outstanding performances keep the rather lopsided story watchable. Whitney Houston made an impressive film debut as Savannah, an ambitious television executive caught in a dead-end affair with a married man (Dennis Haysbert). Angela Basset does Oscar-worthy work as Bernadine, a woman who has spent her life being the best wife and mother she knows how to be, who has her world rocked when her wealthy husband (Michael Beach) calmly announces one night before a formal dinner party that he's in love with someone else and wants a divorce. The scene where Bernadine gathers all her husband's stuff and makes a bonfire out of it in her driveway is one of the film's highlights. Lela Rochon plays Robin, a not-too-bright doormat who finds herself pregnant by a man she wants nothing to do with. Loretta Devine is fun as Gloria, a hairdresser who is divorced from her husband, who it turns out was gay, and is struggling to raise her son (Donald Faison) and tries to begin a relationship with a new neighbor (Gregory Hines). If you can accept the fact that in the world of these four women, all men are pigs, then this film can be very entertaining but the top-notch performances by the cast cannot be overlooked. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Feel Good Movie; The acting in this film is phenomenal, especially on the part of Angela Bassett who always does an amazing job (see What's Love Got To Do With It). The inter-cuts work well where they are placed, much like all of the other shots, and keep the films pace and the viewer interested. I've read other user comments and I find their opinions to be completely biased and unwarranted. If you're watching this film looking for profound insight to life you will be disappointed. This film is an adaptation of Terry McMillan's critically acclaimed novel FOR BLACK FEMALES. Waiting to Exhale explores the lives of four female friends. Each woman makes mistakes and has to deal with those consequences. But it is through being there for one another that they overcome these problems and others. For me, most of the negative user comments are from people who the film was not made for, that are only analyzing the film from the story. There is more to a film than it's narrative and when base your full opinion on that alone you are missing out. Plus, for me, it's just flat-out annoying when people who are completely not the target audience bash a film. Note: this is not to say that art cannot breach color, age or sex barriers. But be let's be realistic for a moment. If say, a heterosexual, black, 21 year old female studying Art was asking you for a good movie suggestion for a Friday night...Would you suggest The Dukes Of Hazard? I think not. Not unless you were joking. Hot Soundtrack, Terrible Character Development; Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end.  It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.  However, much of this is wasted on poor character development.  Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover.  What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies.  While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all.  For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script.  Clearly the answer is that it isn't.  Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with.  Why the director didn't see this, I don't know. Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface. 4/10 Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" WAITING TO EXHALE : Waiting To Go Somewhere, But Sadly It Never Does...; WAITING TO EXHALE Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. \"Waiting To Exhale\", Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book, had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it's star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene. \"Waiting To Exhale\" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone. It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn't know the word \"feelings\" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change. For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they've experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don't seem to learn squat. It's like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. \"Waiting To Exhale\" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose. ... D ... Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life. Please. Sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE HARD TRUTH) looked VERY beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts REALLY made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Decent; Those of you who ranted and raved about how horrible this film was really tickle my funny bone. I love to see miserable people hate a movie just because...well, they have nothing to better to do. Not saying this was the best movie I've ever seen. But I agree with others who say that Bassett and Levine are the ones to save this film from drowning with all the other horrible movies. I love Angela Bassett, I'm a huge fan of hers. The scene which depicts the morning after her husband leaves her for his secretary, which would've otherwise been too cliché for my taste had it not been for the way Bernie (Bassett) burned up that BMW! I mean that was classic. Sorry if any of you testosterone-fueled men out there will accuse me of man hating, but I love that scene and will watch it over and over again. Three cheers for Angie. And Devine's character, Gloria seems sort of weak and unable to stand up to even her teenage son, but I love how she bends a little and confesses how she feels to the late Gregory Hines' character. You'll notice Devine's Gloria and Bassett's Bernie are slightly juxtaposed but their chemistry is excellent. If you haven't seen it, check it out, if not for anything but the performance of these two gifted actors. in response to your response; I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :)  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Entertaining, but the premise has been worn thin -- it's sweet, but unnecessary.; The original \"Father of the Bride\" with Spencer Tracey is a really good comedy, the remake starring Steve Martin is a good sweet-natured, amiable enough comedy - and I don't really think a sequel was necessary at all. I mean the whole premise is basically the same - before George Banks (Martin) had to grasp the reality of his daughter being married, and now he has to come to grips with the fact that she's having a baby. A nice twist on this is that his wife (played by Diane Keaton) is ALSO pregnant, but nevertheless it's still (basically) the same as the first film in one form or another. Thankfully it doesn't seem like a total cash-in (like so many sequels of this sort do) because it has a certain charm (as did the first film) and is still remarkably entertaining, all considered. But you can tell it was made solely because of the success of the first film - even Martin Short is back with another extended cameo as Franz the wedding manager. Of course you may be wondering why he's involved with a pregnancy, since his business is weddings. Here's a hint: more $$$ for the studio. Martin is basically doing the same thing he did in the first film - the weary upper-class guy who feels overwhelmed by the state of things. Diane Keaton is still very sweet and likable as his wife. The rest of the cast (including Macaulay's little brother Kieran Culkin) range from OK to good. Martin Short, however, is yet again a stand-out and is very funny - he wasn't necessary for the plot but he is funny and a good addition to the movie regardless. Overall I'd say this is one of those sequels that didn't need to be made, but could have been a lot worse. It's sweet, it's got some good lite-comedy moments, and in general it's just an enjoyable family movie that isn't trying to be anything other than simple entertainment -- which it is. Like Cliches?; ...That weren't even funny the first time? I've seen a lot of films with Steve Martin in them, and they all made me laugh.  Until this one. Part one is worth a look..it may make you laugh a couple of times (I think I laughed once).  But I recommend avoiding this one all together. Some of Martin's best work!; First, this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2. If run back to back, they run like one beautiful story. This production is great from start to finish. Everything about it is wonderful, including the story, the acting performances and the direction. This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor. His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances. He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man. This movie is no exception. His performance is comedic, yet startlingly genuine. Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's. I love this movie. I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character; with how he feels, and what he's going through. This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum, and I love it. It's less about family, and more about life's curves; the every-day things that make us crazy, happy, sad, and ultimately stronger. It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think, consider, ponder the events which have led us to where we are now. Combined, they rate 8.6/10 from... the Fiend :. I loved it, but one thing bothered me...; I enjoyed this movie: Diane Keaton is my favourite actress, Steve Martin always makes me laugh and Martin Short is great, but I felt really sorry for Keaton having to pretend to be pregnant. She didn't seem to be enjoying it and when the Banks were at the hospital, she actually looked rather bored, because whenever she spoke from the moment George protested about the doctor's name, she almost made it sound like she was in a maths lesson. Apart from that, it was great! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching Martin, Keaton or Short in a movie or who likes to laugh. 9/10 because of the little problem, but it was great. I loved it. Not bad...but could have been better; The first time I saw Father of the Bride 2 I really liked it.  I still enjoy watching some parts of it but I thought some realistic parts in the movie were not necessary.  First of all, the mother and daughter pregnant together.  This could happen but probably when the mother is not older than 40.  Nina had to be at least 47.  Is it likely that the mother would be pregnant at that age? I don't think so.  Secondly, I could not understand why George and Nina wanted the baby to have two last names.  Children always go by their father's last name and I thought Brian's father made a good observation when he said that George and Nina already had Matt to carry on the Banks name.  So why they thought the baby should have two last names is beyond me.  In conclusion, Father of the Bride 2 is still cute and fun to watch in some parts but I thought the first one was much better Not bad, but inferior to the first; I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the first movie. It was not without sentiment and it was hardly original, but it was still beautifully filmed, well acted, charming and funny. This sequel is not as good as the first I agree, but I still quite enjoyed it. The story is predictable, and there are some so-so parts in the script. Eugene Levy, who I do like by the way, is okay here but his character felt somewhat unnecessary and felt like he was there as an additional character and to give the film a longer length. And I also would have liked to have seen more of Kimberley Williams, she is so beautiful and quite a good actress, but I actually do agree that a little too much time is spent between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. However, it is beautifully filmed, has a nice soundtrack, decent pacing and good direction. And the acting is fine too, Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are still very likable, and while as I've said I would have liked to have seen more of her Kimberley Williams was lovely. And I loved Martin Short here too, he was one of the main merits of the first film, so to see him in his wonderfully fluffy turn again was a very nice surprise. Overall, not bad at all, could have been better, but I liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox Funny Sequel; Geogre Banks is getting used to life without his precious daughter Anne. Now he is thinking about all the free time he will have when his son is out of the house.That`s when Anne announces that she is going to have a baby.Geogre is shocked but he becomes even more shocked when he finds out his wife is going to have baby as well.Now he has to deal Franck helping out with the two pregnant women.Can Geogre ever get a break? This is my second favorite movie.My first is Father of the bride part I.This is a good movie.See it it is a great sequel.It is almost as good as the first one. Steve Martin steals the screen. Loved it!!; I thought the sequel to the first Father of the Bride just showed what a great chemistry Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, George Newbern, and Kieran Culkin, along with all the other supporting actors have together. I would actually love to see a Father of the Bride Part III and I usually hate more and more sequels. I really do enjoy this sequel and I think it is better than the first one. I would reccommend any and everyone seeing this movie (but not without seeing the first one). No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. This is my favorite movie; ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is my favorite movie.  I think it is funny, sweet, and truly touches the heart.  In the sequel to the previous, Father of the Bride, George Banks (Steve Martin) is finally getting over the fact that his beloved daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams)has gotten married.  But then she shocks him with the news that she is pregnant.  Everyone else is thrilled, but George is not.  He believes that he is too young to be a grandfather.  He tries to become young, but doesn't succeed.  Then, both he and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton) are shocked to find out that Nina is also pregnant.  George now thinks he is too old to be a father.  They have one other child other then Annie, Matty (Kieren Culkin.)  Through the chaotic turns of pregnancy, George learns to except the fact that his daughter has grown up and moved on, even though it is hard.  They also have to deal with Fronk (Martin Short,) the goofy wedding coordinator from the first movie, who is now designing the new baby's room.  They then discover that Annie has been given the opportunity to design a museaum in Boston, far away from their own, San Marino, California.  George now realizes that he will miss his daughter more then ever, but he learns to get along.  In the end, he enjoys being a grandfather to baby George, and a father again, to Megan, named after the doctor who delievered her.  In this funny and heartwarming sequel, everyone puts out fantastic performences once again.  Even though I very much enjoy Father of the Bride, I enjoy this much more. Very Warm and Funny.; This movie is a very warm and funny family film. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the Sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny. The only thing I didn't like was Eugene Levy's character, I found that his part was just put there to extend the movie a bit. I also didn't like how they used him in the second one when he was clearly the one who auditioned to be the wedding singer in the first one. All in all this is a great family film where many will enjoy and watch together. One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. Worthy second installment.; Mild SPOILERS are contained in the following comments. However, I believe everyone knows the story and how it turns out. The fun of the movie is seeing the actors, especially Martin. Steve Martin is back as George Banks, having just lost his daughter and basketball partner (Kimberly Williams as Annie ) to marriage, and now she is back home with her husband and a big announcement. She is pregnant. Of course everyone is happy, and the joy is doubled when Nina Banks (Diane Keaton as Annie's mom) finds out she is pregnant too. Poor George doesn't know if he can handle all this. After all, he is about to be a grandfather, he's not prepared to be a new father also. Martin Short is back as Franck Eggelhoffer, the unintelligible wedding planner. All ends well as both mom and daughter deliver their babies at the same time, in separate hospital rooms, so George has to go back and forth. The movie ends a few months later, and as Annie and her new baby are leaving, she gives dad a miniature basketball, a reminder to George that he can raise another basketball partner. Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. Better than the original; This one is definitely better than the original, funnier, smoother pace, and in some places, better acting! Plus Martin Short has more screen time. Great! This is a great movie for anyone who like good clean comedy. Awesome! Five out of Five Moose Stars! great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a 10, i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Deja Vu; I found this sequel to be both charming and entertaining. What I learned tonight is that this movie is actually a remake of the 1951 movie \"Father's Little Dividend\", which in turn was the sequel to the original \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and with the same great cast: Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Bennett, et al.  They both share the same broad comedy and story line (only one pregnancy in the earlier version though), and in their own ways are equally entertaining.  Old or new incarnations, however, be sure to see parts one and two in sequence. Average comedy sequel; There's been better, and there's been worse. \"Father of the Bride Part II\" falls right in between when it comes to sequels of comedies. The plot was easily predictable and the movie didn't have as many Steve Martin funny moments as the original. There were some good moments that made me laugh though, most being scenes with Martin Short. It did seem like sort of a stretch, though that all of the sudden \"Frank\" was an interior designer as well as a wedding/baby shower coordinator. I guess they just needed a way to keep him in the movie longer. I was hoping for a lot more when I rented this. My advice: stick to the original. Touching even in its weak state.; Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, and kimberly Williams Paisley return in Father of the Bride Part 2. The film as a sequel was slightly disappointing, but on the whole, likeable. George and Nina Banks are in for the surprise of their lives when they find themselves middleaged and expecting their third child.  The timing is impeccable as Annie Banks-MAckenzie also realizes that she is expecting. Thus Steve MArtin embarks on a nine month journey that will consist of him building a new room for the baby, watching his daughter become a woman and overdosing on sleeping pills.  Honestly, the film made me laugh hysterically and i shed a few tears at the bittersweet ending. 3 and 1/2 stars out of five. Pretty much just a rehash of the first; As this movie started, it reminded me a lot of the first. Various scenes were reenacted, only a little wackier, sort of like it was trying to be a shade more funny than the first; I guess that is the usual stuff for this type of sequels, but I think it failed at that. Apart from that, the movie pretty much succeeds in being a good sequel to the first. The story is also somewhat reminiscent of the first one. All the same actors return as well, and they are pretty much the same, just a shade more wacky. The story is also told by Steve Martins character, George Banks, like in the first. Pretty much everything in the movie is a takeoff of the first; this doesn't make it bad though, if you liked the first, liked the characters, you'll want to see this too, if nothing else, to see the characters again. It is about as funny and as sentimental as the first was, and as enjoyable. Fans of the first one, or of Steve Martin will most likely enjoy at least some part of it, as this is the typical for both the first movie and Steve Martin. 7/10 Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie. A (Rare) Good Sequel; The first \"Father of the Bride\" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin's great comedic \"Dad\" character with the emotions of marrying off his \"only\" (to that point!) daughter. However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor. Thankfully, \"Father of the Bride II\" does not fall into this trap. With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather. Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton). Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women! Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments. Whereas the first film captured George's equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George's identity crisis. With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family. Overall, this film is just as good as the original. The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare. Let's just say that if a \"Grandfather of the Bride\" were in the works, I would be first in line. My comments are going to be very positive.; Hi! I think that Father of the Bride Part 2 was a great film and very hilarious. I think that the mother and daughter could have been pregnant at the same time!  It was a great movie and I recommend it to all people who want a warm-your-heart comedy! It's a great film! Thanks! I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. I really found this film quite annoying; My basic opinion of this movie is that it is a crappy American feel good comedy. It is simply about a man who is going through another mid-life crisis as his daughter, who was married in the first movie, has a baby in this one. The catch is that his wife is also pregnant and with the irony really dripping, both of them have their babies within minutes of each other. As such the kid's auntie is exactly the same age as him (it won't happen to me, though it is possible). When I watch this movie I think to myself, this guy really doesn't have problems. There are people out there that have much more serious problems than he does. He admits to having a beautiful wife who loves him, owns his own home (or did), has a great job and great kids - and he thinks he has problems. Maybe the whole comedy is in the fact that he is worrying about absolutely nothing, but seriously, when I watch this movie, I simply shake my head and think that the guy is a loser. I really don't think it is all that funny. In fact, the guy has much more serious problems. He seems to be spending an awful lot of money, and is going to find himself in a huge amount of debt, and he doesn't seem to ever be at work. My question is not only where he gets his money, but where he gets the collateral for all of the purchases he is making. He buys back his house for an extra $100,000 on top of what he sold it for, and really, how can he seriously afford it. Okay, it wasn't all that bad. As a movie is was made well, and I did chuckle a few times. But in reality, this guy is a serious loser because he has more than anybody could possibly ask for, and he is worried about growing old. Hell, we all grow old, but he has experience more than what a lot of us have already had. Instead of worrying about growing old, the twit should look back on his life and be thankful for the blessings that God has already given him as opposed to forgetting all of that and winging about his age. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late '40's)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... The Best Movie of All Time; let me tell you.. anyone who does not like the movie is just a little close minded.. i read comments that thought the movie was too unrealistic but thats what makes it so great! i mean look at other movies such as lord of the rings or star wars neither or them contain true reality.. this is why its a movie. Anyway, i loved Steve martin in this movie. he does a magnificent job of playing the character for an over protective dramatic father. he was the best actor. who could have played the part of Nina as well as Diane Keaton. she makes the part of the mom annoyingly overwhelming mother, which is exactly what the point of us as the audience to think of her. martin short is the best of all \"fra'nk's\". the way he seeks George banks's approval is perfect. and lastly Kimberly Williams is the gorgeous daughter we are all expecting her to be.. i watch this movie every night before bed and i can recite every word to this movie. because of father of the bride II i have dreamed to meet Steve martin.. \"hes my hero!!\" hopefully you fall in love with it too. and dream to be pregnant with your mother as did Annie banks. Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. 5/10 And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW2, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. daughter gets married; In the sequel to Father of the Bride we have the daughter getting married and moving away from home, this presents a big dilemma to the father played of course by Steve Martin. Maybe not quite as funny as the first one,, or as good,, but definitely above average,, it's always a pleasure watching Steve Martin work at his craft. The movie is basically about how the family,, especially the parents deal with their young daughter growing up,, getting married, and eventually moving away from the nest.. the cameo from Eugene Levy is just wonderful,, as a real estate agent who is trying to sell the very home where our main character lives.. all in all a very family friendly movie,, that I would recommend. Not as good as the first, but still great fun.; In the sequel to the brilliant Father Of The Bride, Nina Banks and her daughter Annie are both pregnant and George Banks, being his usual nervous self has to learn to get used to the idea that he's going to be a father again AND a grandfather. The whole cast including, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams and Martin Short are all back here giving good performances. Even though Father Of The Bride Part II is not as good as the first Father Of The Bride, this is still a great movie which is enjoyable and fun all the way through and that's why I'm going to give this good sequel a 10/10.  Heartwarming & Hilarious; Steve Martin does it again in this touching and funny sequel to 1991's Father Of The Bride the rest of the cast returns in a new story dealing with the joys of parenthood. I loved Father Of The Bride II not only because it was funny, mostly it was due to the comic antics of a man dealing with two pregnancies at once. He's a great comedian as well as an on screen father, my favorite scene is when both babies arrive at the same time. A year has passed since George Banks (Martin) watched his only daughter Annie (Williams) get married and has accepted her transformation from daughter to wife. She comes home with her husband Brian (Newbern) to announce the wonderful news to her parents, brother Matty (Culkin) and in-laws that she's pregnant. Everyone is thrilled and excited except for George who thinks he's too young to be a grandpa, from then on he tries to act young by dying his hair and exercising. But things are about to get a little crazy when his loving wife Nina (Keaton)discovers she's pregnant too now George must deal with the impending arrival of both his grandchild and his own child. Thrown into the chaos is Franck Eggelhoffer (Short) the wedding coordinator who helps to design a room for the new addition to the Banks family. This movie is not only sweet but it's charming entertainment for fans of all ages. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the 1951 sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of 50. This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! Father of the Bride Part II; The first film was the remake of the original version starring Spencer Tracy and Dame Elizabeth Taylor, and it became very popular, so naturally they felt like a sequel was needed to continue the story. Basically George Banks (Golden Globe nominated Steve Martin) is getting used to the fact that his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) has become the bride now wife and got married to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), and more surprisingly a mother when she reveals she is pregnant. With this revelation comes out George has a small midlife crisis, and he tries to recapture his youth, including dying his hair, but he does eventually settle somewhat and get used to the idea that he will be a grandfather. But then he is shocked to find out he will be a father again as well when his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) reveals that she is also pregnant, and it may appear that both her and Annie's baby will be born on the same day. With these things happening, and the house having leaks and termites there is the opportunity to change things by selling the house to Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy), but he changes his mind later. When George manages to get the house back, despite a higher price, he gets the help of camp wedding planner/coordinator, now interior designer, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) to make the baby rooms and get things ready for the arrival of children. There are a couple of false alarms from Annie where she thinks the baby is coming, but eventually it comes to the real thing, and they rush to hospital, and of course Nina goes in to labour as well. In the end George is very happy to be holding both his new baby son and his new baby granddaughter is his arms, before his daughter and her husband move away to their own new home. Also starring Kieran Culkin as Matty Banks, B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein, Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie and Jane Adams as Dr. Megan Eisenberg. I can see what the critics mean by giving it two out of five stars in certain places, it certainly isn't as funny as the original film, it concentrates more on the sentimental material, but that's not a bad thing for this comedy drama. Okay! A really likable comedy.; I enjoyed this film. I found that it was easy to relate to Steve Martin's character George Banks as a parent. The relationship between him and his daughter Annie, played by Kimberly Williams, was an honest father daughter relationship. I recommend this one for parents in general and empty nesters in particular. The idea of a mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time is plausible and amusing. like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $15k bonus to move out in 10 days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $100k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. Father of the Bride II; Likable, but not as impressive a follow up to the 1991 hit with Martin now dealing with his daughter being pregnant...And, oh yeah...his wife is pregnant again too. good, but a mistake; this movie rocks. but there is one thing weird. okay, so in the beginning Annie says, \"i have lived here since i was 5!\" and then later right when they are selling the house and playing basketball Annie and George(her dad) and her dad says \"i remember the first time we played out here, you were 4.\" wait...so was she 4 or 5 when they moved in??????????? other than that this movie makes me laugh, cry(because i laugh so much), and..........uh.....what was that other thing people say when they say that? i don't really remember. i just love how Steve martin always is so cheap. I am forced to say more so i will say i love that this movie is always on HBO! And i realized something, Steve martin has had white hair like forever! Not as good as the first, but good family fun; This movie is as thin as you can get. Its' emotions are easily played. There are no surprises. It is very predictable. And I say...so what? What is wrong with that? This is an American Dream movie. Everything goes perfectly and everyone is as happy as can be. Why should it be a complicated character study? It deals with the birth of babies. There's no complex feelings that need to be dealt with in this situation. A life is being created. A family is being blessed. A baby's birth is a time for love and hope. This movie has both in spades. It's a very positive movie that shows the joy a new baby brings. Every parent-to-be should watch it. A child's birth is an emotional event with no equal. This movie knows it and milks it for all its' worth. My only complaint is it should have been called Parents of the Bride. Way too much time is spent with the relationship between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. There should have been more attention paid to Kimberly Williams. Not only were the scenes between her and Martin the best scenes in this and the original, but Kimberly Williams is the most beautiful actress to come out of Hollywood in many years. Forget all the blond, silicone filled, bimbos that every teenage boy raves about. Ms. Williams is a natural beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****. Better than the first one!; I love Steve Martin, but I was disappointed by the first movie, so I wasn't expecting as much from this one.  But to my surprise, this one was even better! It's constantly funny, just like one should expect from Steve Martin; it's not preoccupied with corny emotion, like the first movie was. It's Steve Martin in his best performance since \"My Blue Heaven.\" Sometimes sequels can be surprisingly good.  This one is better.  It has all the comedic elements that were stagnant in the first movie.  It's everything the first movie should have been, and more! As I understand it, there were accusations of anti-Arab stereotyping?; \"Father of the Bride II\" may seem to some people like a lesser Steve Martin movie, with him as the patriarch from the previous movie now having to deal with his daughter's and wife's pregnancies. Unpretentiously silly. But one interesting thing is that apparently, some Arab groups claimed that the movie was making anti-Arab stereotypes, as a Middle Eastern man buys their house with plans to demolish it. I wouldn't have interpreted that as anti-Arab; I mean, it's not like they're portraying him as a terrorist. Oh well, life goes on. The movie's a nice, goofy way to pass time. I really liked the scene where they bring Steve Martin into the hospital (that would've sure been an embarrassment!). Also starring Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, B.D. Wong and Eugene Levy. Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video Good, but first one was better; This film is good but you have to suspend disbelief quite a few times. All the performances are fine, with Steve Martin a scream again, and Diane Keaton glowing from start to finish (she has a lot more to do here than in FOTB1). The best scenes are: George trying to get buff in the gym, asking which famous men he's younger than, pointing to his wedding ring at the lady in the car next to him, and seeing all the misbehaving children out the window in his car while his wife sees all the happy kids and their parents out her window. And of course, when George holds his child and grandchild outside the delivery room. My favorite line: \"Now going to the movies will be economical: one child, two seniors, thanks!\" Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Good; This is well worth seeing. Everything goes perfectly. Ain't no such thing as too much Steve Martin, baby. Here Martin carries weak material, but it's a positive movie that shows the joy a new child brings. You will laugh, cry and cheer. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Some of the dialog is a bit lost on US audiences, but still some hilarious lines. The music is amazing throughout. Also the scenery is incredible. I saw the cast had a lot of great comedians, so I thought there would at least be a few laughs. Instead, I was surprised to see a very touching movie, absolutely great script. I give it 7 out of 10. AWESOME!; This movie is great!  I think it's one of the best movies ever made!  I love both Father of the Bride I and II!  I think that it is cute how they have the mother and daughter pregnant at the same time!  I hope that they come out with a Father of the Bride Part III, that would be awesome! :-) Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. 2.5 out of 5 stars. Good, so long as you don't try to think too much; It was a fun movie, but it had no particular substance. I mostly watched it because I'd seen the first one. And because it was free on my cable. Or at least, I wasn't paying only to see it. Now, I have done that before and been pleasantly surprised, but this just wasn't one of those movies. Most of what was in this movie has been done already in the first film, and then it was in a much better way. Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, I'm just glad that I got to watch it free. Sure, Steve Martin's always fun to watch, particularly when he's acting dopey for whatever reason, but that didn't make it a great film. Just mediocre. Still, it's fun for a laugh. A Well-Done Sequel!; A sequel to immensely likable Father of the Bride, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is A Well-Done Sequel! Its enjoyable as well as emotional! 'Father of the Bride Part II' Synopsis: George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. 'Father of the Bride Part II' is worthy sequel of a wonderful prequel. The characters still appeal, the humor works & the emotional moments are heartfelt as well. Nancy Meyers & Charles Shyer's Screenplay is genuinely well-done. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography & Editing are fair. Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains. On the whole, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is a satisfying sequel. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the 1951 movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the 1950 classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the 4 year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. A so so sequel; 'Father of the bride' was a good film and probably didn't need a sequel. But this is Hollywood, everything needs a sequel. While it is clear that a lot of effort has gone into making this sequel work, the central idea stretches credibility and every idea the writer had seems to have been thrown at the wall in a desperate attempt to get laughs. There are moments that remind you of the heart and humour that the preceding film had, but it's a load of nothing really. I went into this film dubious about how good it could be, and I didn't finish watching it any more convinced that the original needed a sequel. \"Father 2\" : Born again.; Okay,now the sequel \"Father Of The Bride 2\",which was surprisingly better than expected. Like anyone who sees a sequel,you expect almost a carbon copy of the first. It does start similar to the first movie,with George sitting in a chair addressing us,the audience. It also does an unfortunate repeat of the fight between Annie & Bryan,again like the first movie,I saw it coming. The baby shower party is not played big,like the first after wedding party but I laughed when actual storks carrying little bundles showed up. I was kind of \"iffy\" on the sub-plot of George selling the house,having to leave in ten days and then blowing a bundle to get it back again. I'm not questioning the probability (we know in reality that'd be impossible),I just found it kind of unnecessary. I did however like his dyed hair and new look,that was hilarious and he should have kept it until the end of the movie. Some may say the idea of a mother & daughter being pregnant at the same time,is impossible. Yet,somehow it works here. It's not just the obvious next step for Annie but for George and his wife too,who thought having babies was way behind them. I love Steve Martin's warped expression when Bryan calls him a \"Grandfather\"! I liked that a woman having a baby in her 40's was taken very seriously,since it's a fact that women who have babies later in life have a more difficult time. It makes for a good piece of drama in a film that's otherwise a family comedy. The comedy is helped once again by the presence of Martin Short and I like that he becomes more involved with the family. Especially helping George out the front door on his back. This after giving him sleeping pills for rest. Once the babies are born and Bryan & Annie head to Boston for a new life,the film gets a very touching ending with George and his new baby girl. 8 out of 10 for the expected repeat of ideas,otherwise a very well made sequel. (END) Fantastic; Both the first movie and this sequel are fantastic. I loved the first movie, so I thought I would give the second one a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised!! The acting from all the characters is amazing, from Steve Martin to Diane Keaton to Kimberly Williams-Paisley. 16 years after its release this movie is still a gem. When I'm feeling down or just need a go-to comedy for a night in, these two movies are the best. For those who say that a 40-something woman is too old to have a baby--that's just not true. Do your research. I bet more people have been in that situation than you think. Anyway, this is a feel-good movie for some great laughs and a few happy tears! Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in 1995. It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. not bad for a sequel; as sequels go,this is film isn't too bad.i didn't think ti was quite as good as the first one,but it's not a bad effort.i didn't find it as funny,and some of Steve Martin's histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me.really,this one doesn't quite have the same sincerity as the first.through much of this movie,i was all too aware i was watching a movie,whereas with firs tone,i was drawn in,and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting.having said that,there are some bright spots.for,one,this movie is just as touching as the first.and Eugene levy has a great cameo.and there is still some fun to be had.even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above,i still think Father of the Bride II is a 7/10 Not exactly the most innovative of films, but still great fun!; This is an excellent, funny, warming film. Although a lot of the \"same kind of thing\" was done in the first movie, it's still entertaining. Steve Martin's character was good, although at times his behaviour is quite pathetic and Martin Short is again entertaining. (Particularly his pronunciation of the word 'pregnant).' Although it's highly predictable and not the most intellectually stimulating of films it is still well worth watching and the vast majority of people would enjoy this film. What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Father of the Bride Part II; The 1991 Steve Martin comedy proved out to be popular enough to earn a sequel, much like the original Father of the Bride of 1950. All of the main cast of the first film returns in a story where the eponymous father George Banks (Martin) has gotten over the stressful wedding of his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) and her fiancé Bryan (George Newbern). However, when she breaks the big news about her pregnancy to the family, the grandpa-to-be becomes anxious about getting older and starts proving his youthfulness in various ways, such as selling the family's beloved house to a greedy real estate developer Habib (Eugene Levy). Life has more in store for George and his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) though, as it soon turns out that Annie's is not the only pregnancy in the family. Again, the humour is best when it relies on Steve Martin's comical talent and charisma instead of craziness and exaggeration. Unfortunately, adhering to the rule of always making sequels bigger and louder, the writers have given more screen time to the unbelievably annoying wedding planner Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) whose noisy and flamboyant scenes are certainly the weakest parts of the whole movie. The fussy bumbling caused by the impending childbirths at the end is also rather annoying and unimaginative. I think the movie works best during the more subtle scenes, such as Martin making uncomfortable faces while hiding his nervousness or arguing about the baby's surname with the overjoyed family during a dinner. Besides the run-of-the-mill jokes, the movie also shamelessly wallows in impenetrable sentimentalism of the newborns' adorability. Especially the music is so unbelievably schmaltzy that it was really getting on my nerves while watching; can't the filmmakers just trust their material's appeal without burying it under a sweety-tweety sugar mountain? Nevertheless, despite the predictability of the plot and the not-so-hilarious jokes, George Banks is a very likable character and Steve Martin is at home in the role, so those who enjoyed the first movie will probably like this one too  the basic building blocks of the story have not been changed at all.

But if you have not watched a movie by Pixar yet, you are in for a treat. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy the movies they do. But they work as family movies, kids movies or just \"plain\" movies. It is only a matter of time until Pixar will win an Oscar. Not for animated picture (they've done that and will be doing it for many years to come), but for Best Picture (period)! Toy Story is a ... well story-fantasy that many kids have while they grow up. And to see that come to life (no pun intended), is just great. Especially because Pixar equally has treats for kids and grown-ups alike. You'd have to be a cynic to not like it, I guess. But if you do not have an aversion against animated pictures, you have to check this one out Came at a time when cgi was not doing well and changed the film industry; The plot is Woody, Hanks, a cowboy toy who is Andy's favorite toy but when Andy goes away, the toys come alive and are concerned because Andy's birthday is coming up and they are wondering who will be replaced. Woody is there to calm everyone down because he is Andy's favorite. Until a new toy called Buzz, Allen, shows up with all the latest in toy technology. Woody tries to fight for attention but thanks to this, they both get lost. The rest of the film is them trying to get back to Andy before he moves. The strength of this movie is the writing and these characters are amazingly written and are put in a great concept. There is only jealousy as the villain and this leads to great comedy. In my opinion, some of the best forms of comedy are made from competition and seeing these two characters trying to do the right thing and just being consumed by jealousy is great to watch. It was also clever and interesting. The film doesn't really have a villain. OK, maybe Sid, who loves to blow up toys, and you either knew this kid or was this kid when growing up. However, even Sid is just trying to have fun. So, he can't really be called a villain. That is why the writers are so good. They make everyone identifiable. The idea of toys coming to life is nothing new, we have seen it before but they put this wonderful little spin on it which just works. The CGI holds up pretty well. Sometimes. The plastic texture make it seem pretty decent but they needed to put more time into the humans because they look more plastic than the toys. That is just nitpicking. The film is still unbelievably good. The throw all their talent and all their effort into this movie. Especially in the writing and the characters, thus making it an animated classic. One that films try to copy even to this day. But this would be the first great success for pixar and the animated CG revolution had just begun. Wonderful Film One of Pixar's Best; I love animated Disney films, although I must say I usually prefer the original classic hand drawn Disney films, at some point we have to accept change, and what better way to accept this change with a wonderful superb film. (I mean common they booked Toy Story 4 already). Toy's come to life when their owner is asleep, and its all about the battle for who is the best and most popular toy. Whenever Christmas or the little boy's birthday come around the toys get nervous that they will be abandoned or replaced. When a new toy arrives they are determined to hate him and ignore him, but they end up becoming friends. Greatest animation film ever; Toy Story was the first full-length children's feature made entirely with computer-generated animation, and it was released in 1995. This film has an amazing plot, with great characters and actress which makes Toy Story the greatest animation film ever. Toy story is a buddy movie/adventure tale with an understated lesson about the value of friendship. \"You can count on me!\" Toy Story was about two toys, an old, beloved cowboy named woody (voice of Tom Hanks) and new beloved space ranger, named Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen). Both of these toys try and compete for the love of the human boy named Andy Davis (voice of John Morris) who plays with them, not knowing that they come alive when he lives the room. Toy Story takes place in Andy's bedroom where Woody is always placed on the bed and the rest of the toys are placed in the chest or on the shelves. One day the toys found out that Andy was having a birthday party and became scared that they might be replaced with newer toys. Woody the leader of the toys, calms the other toys down and sends a team of toy soldiers down stairs to scope out the new coming toys. As Andy is opening his gifts the most alarming arrival was brought to the scene when the new comer Buzz Lightyear was opened. Andy fell in love with Buzz Lightyear and ran up stairs and threw Woody off of the bed and replaced Buzz Lightyear in Woody's place. In the first half of the movie Woody and Buzz didn't get along and fought for the love of Andy and the other toys. As the plot takes a different direction when the family decides to move, Woody and Buzz find themselves stuck at the gas station with no idea on how to get home. This is where the theme of friendship takes over in the film. As Woody and Buzz starts to work together to find their way home Sin, Andy's next door neighbor picks them up. As the toys are placed in Sin's room they see Sin feed other toys to his dog. This is when Woody and Buzz join forces and try to escape the house before Sin feeds them to his the dog. Toy Story remains me of Avatar with the use of the computer- generated imagery. Like Toy Story, Avatar brought the characters to life with the use of all the different colors schemes, lighting and angles. Both of these films characters looked very human like and real and both won rewards for their use of animation. Sparkling family entertainment; Disney/Pixar initiated a new sophisticated form of animation with the 1995 box office smash Toy Story, a richly entertaining and imaginative animated adventure that not only spawned two sequels, but became a merchandising dream. The film opens in the bedroom of a little boy named Andy who is moving in a couple of days. The central characters are Andy's toys, who are led by a cowboy action figure named Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), who is apparently Andy's favorite toy. Woody and the other toys feel seriously threatened when Andy receives a space action figure called Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) for his birthday. Immediate antagonism materializes between Woody and Buzz when Woody feels he might be replaced in Andy's heart, but Woody and Buzz are forced to bond and actually become friends when they become prisoners of Andy's next door neighbor, Sid, a sadistic little kid who likes to torture toys. This deliciously imaginative story works thanks to a brilliant screenplay that brings vivid and believable emotions to toys, effectively showcasing the world from a toy's point of view. The jealousy and resentment between Woody and Buzz rings completely true and is actually the glue that keeps this story moving. Though the story provides consistent laughs, there are a couple of poignant moments as well...watch when Andy stops sleeping with Woody, who gets demoted from Andy's bed to the toy box or watch when Buzz sees a commercial for himself and finally realizes that he is a toy and is not real. As always with Disney animated films, the voice casting is perfection, with standout work from Hanks, whose work here rivals the voice work of Robin Williams in Aladdin...he makes us love and care for Woody and puts us in his corner from jump. Mention should also be made of Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Jim Varney as the Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as a very insecure toy dinosaur, John Ratzenberger as a piggy bank named Ham, and R. Lee Ermey as a toy soldier. Really liked Annie Potts as a Little Bo Peep doll too, though I just couldn't get past my trouble with the fact that a little boy would own a Little Bo Peep doll, but I did not allow this to deter my enjoyment here. Randy Newman contributed a couple of nice songs to the film, one of which, \"You've Got a Friend\", received an Oscar nomination. John Lasseter's direction and his contribution to the Oscar nominated screenplay are the final touches to this entertaining adventure that actually conjured up images of Spielberg work like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future, and though the story does have a couple of extra endings, it is a richly entertaining fantasy adventure that had me laughing and smiling throughout the entire running time. It was a beautiful movie!; I bought a 10th anniversary special edition of Toy Story a few years back when I was 8 or 9 years old. That was how I was first introduced to Toy Story. The movie was very touching and emotional. Listening to the developers' talking about how they made the movie and hearing the various reviews from many people about Toy Story was nice. I loved how Andy (and don't forget Buzz) never gave up throughout the movie, acting like most people in the world generally do (showing that toys are much like us), whether for the good or bad. I liked how the both helped each other and worked together in the movie. It was a great experience and I recommend that you who haven't watched it should. In the end, both realized their mistakes, admitted them and changed to become better persons. Sorry, toys. Good and groundbreaking; Good and groundbreaking computer animation graphics movie that delivers but does not reach a higher level due to the animation itself not having the \"warmth\" of the drawing style classic Disney animations.Still,the computer style here is very promising and quite impressive.Good story and script.A good solid start in a new trend in animation production.Very good voice acting.Only for fans of kids movies..... The greatest animation ever made.; This film amazed me it has one of the greatest scripts ever made it's lines are among the most memorable even though the two stars never met each other while filming was taking place and it brings together a fantastic cast including Tim Allen and Tom Hanks and an amazing supporting cast. The animation is completely perfect and the fact that it doesn't let itself be rolled into Disney Schmaltz too bad is another plus. a fantastic film with an unbelievably great script a real masterpiece and a great role model for other films too follow and a fantastic start for that studios career which has also continued with Monsters Inc and A bugs life if you haven't already got it go out and buy it. 5 out of 5 stars One of the Top Ten Movies of the 1990s; If there's any justice in this crazy world of ours, \"Toy Story\" will become a classic in the mode of \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Snow White.\" I look forward to its appearing every year on television, as a much anticipated \"event.\" It certainly is groundbreaking, what with imagery that must've taken a computer system dwarfing the pentagon's to do. But I love how well-thought-out this movie is. The plot works from beginning to end. The performances are terrific--Tom Hanks and Tim Allen don't just blather their lines onto the soundtrack, leaving it for the animators to do all the work. No, rather, they're really *acting* here, imbuing their characters with as much depth and breadth as if they'd been playing flesh-and-blood people. Keep a sharp eye, movie lovers, inside gags abound: When Woody runs from an escaped globe, you'll think it looks just like the giant ball sequence from \"Raiders,\" and you'll be right! When Buzz walks amid a sea of tiny alien squeak-toys, Richard Dreyfuss' close encounter \"...of the Third Kind,\" of course, should echo in your mind. The look of the movie *is* stunning--and, IMO, it \"works\" in every instance but one: Syd's dog. Instead of looking canine, he looks instead like a fur-covered football. I wish Pixar had spent a few more pixels refining his \"look.\" But all that's quibbling. Here's a movie for every kid who whiled away an afternoon while sprawled in front of a toy box and for every adult who ever wondered what happens to those Little Tykes people once you turn off the lights and go to bed... A resounding success; Pixar knocks it out of the park with its first feature film, about friendship, jealousy and the capriciousness of privileged white kids in a society of disposability. A clever, sharp and imaginative screenplay expertly voiced by a stellar cast (I would give this 5/10 just for casting Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head) keeps the swiftly moving story engaging throughout, flagging only a bit when self- deluded toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is briefly depressed. The film hops from one great set-piece to the next with head-spinning speed that leaves me marveling at how simple director John Lasseter and the team of animators make it look to bring these toys to life with just a few touches of individuality. Every viewer will probably have their favorite parts. Back when I first saw the movie upon its initial release, mine was the new-age toys who worship the Claw; upon recent viewing, I think it is \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" rendition of evil neighbor Sid's bedroom. It's hard to remember now that Pixar has proved so successful that there was real doubt about whether its style of computer-graphics animation would be embraced by audiences -- kudos to Pixar for proving the doubters wrong. Toy Story 1; I have to give Toy Story 1 an 8 b/c even though I am a grown adult, I love all types of Disney movies but this one nearly tops the charts. Toy Story 2 on the other hand gets a 2, it was the most boring movie there ever was... actually kind of depressing to. Granted Toy Story 1 was extremely good it's just not a movie they should have came out with a sequel to. I am currently searching for pictures (scenes) from the movie because of my screen name I would like to find pictures of buzz with the pink hat on portraying Misses Nesbit. If anyone has these pictures could you please reply? I also believe that Toy Story 1 was the best movie because of the cool graphic's. I think that Disney done an exceptional job on the movie in parts where the Pizza Planet scene was taken because of the reality of the crane machine and the little green aliens. Also the kids in the scenes looked very real to, even though I think the mother of Andy had way to much animation in it. fun; I love the movie toy story because it is fun and a good movie. I love the movie because woody found out there was going to be another toy for Andy and he was getting jealous. When woody saw the new toy he was really jealous because the other toys likes buzz and not woody. Woody wanted to get rid of buzz but getting to the end he regrets what he did to buzz and he went to save buzz and wanted to be friends with him. When the other toys ask for buzz woody always had an excuse and his friends found out that he wanted to rid of buzz so all his friends was really mad at buzz. His friends tried to find buzz. They found buzz in a pizza place where they had arcades and other stuff. When they found buzz woody apologized buzz and he wanted to be friends and be OK with everything. This Movie is Great!!; Toy Story was the best Pixar movie i ever watched! It has a good start where Andy has a birthday with his favourite toy: Woody. And Andy's Mom says \"Go Get Molly, the party is about to start!\" So Andy runs to his Room to get Molly. Woody realized he was not Andy's favourite toy anymore, So Woody wants to be Andy's favourite toy again! Woody had to find a way to knock Buzz out of the house, And Andy bringing Woody to Pizza Planet! So Woody was fighting Buzz, He realized he was a lost toy. So Woody Found A Pizza Car with a Spaceship on the top! So Buzz finds a Spaceship Claw Machine. Buzz found Alien toys in the Machine! The Aliens found The Claw! So Sid tries to get Buzz, But he got double prizes!! The Ending was great!! The ending had Andy moving in a new house, Then getting new stuff for Christmas, Then Woody And Buzz seemed happy at each other! rather clever; Great Pixar movie. I love the idea and the point to this animated feature. It's so good in so many ways. I remember it came out in theaters when I was three and wanted to see it so badly I couldn't sleep for weeks. This movie has been out for over ten years and I still enjoy it today as a teenager. It's great for all ages and brings so many laughs to a lot of young and older people. I especially love the part when Buzz Lightyear is in denial and thinks he is Mrs. Nizbet. That was SOOOOOOOOO funny!!!!!!!!! LMAO!!!!!!!!!! This movie is always going to be remembered for so long. Even the sequel was really good. I'm gonna have to post a comment on that on too. Anyways great movie. Loud laughs for everyone. My Favorite Animated Film EVER; I love Toy Story. Plain and simple, it's a phenomenal film. Not only is it one of the most well-made animated films ever made, it's also one of my favorite films in general. It's incredibly appealing story, the voice acting is perfect, the characters are very likable and fun to watch on screen, and the animation is stellar for it's time. The basic premise of TOY STORY is life seen through the eyes of a toy. The film centers around the toys belonging to a boy named Andy, particularly following his favorite toy, a stuffed cowboy doll named Woody. Woody is primarily the one in charge of Andy's room, but his authority is threatened when Andy gets a new spaceman toy named Buzz Lightyear. The only problem is that Buzz doesn't know he's a toy. He genuinely thinks that he is a real space ranger. Tom Hanks voices Woody and Tim Allen voices Buzz, and both do a stellar job. I couldn't ever imagine anybody voicing these two characters besides Hanks and Allen. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well, such as Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, and others. The characters are so fun to watch, and you truly care about them as you watch Woody and Buzz form a friendship. At it's heart, Toy Story is a buddy movie, and one of the best made at that. While the animation seems somewhat dated today when compared to PIXAR's more recent films, the film does still look very nice. Looking back at the film, it truly is a technological achievement as well as a film-making achievement in general. Being the first animated film done entirely through computers, Toy Story had a lot of expectations to meet. And not only does it meet expectations, it surpasses them to infinity and beyond. This Is A Great Family Movie; Imagine a world where whenever your back is turned or whenever you leave a room your toys come to life and communicate with each other like we do. Woody is the toy cowboy doll of a boy called Andy. Woody is Andys favorite toy until one day Andys birthday comes around and he gets a new toy which quickly becomes Andys favourite toy ahead of Woody. Woody quickly becomes jealous because not only has Andy pushed him aside but his fellow toy friends have chosen the new toy Buzz Lightyear ahead of Woody so now Woody plots a way to get Buzz out of the way for good with disastrous consequences. I will say no more about the movie as i feel if you haven't seen it then most of this film should be a surprise to you. All i do have to say however is Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz are superb choices as the voices of the main characters. This is an incredibly warm hearted and fun family film that a child of any age would love. Wonderful animated feature...; TOY STORY is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. It goes along with TOY STORY 2, TARZAN, A BUG'S LIFE, THE LION KING and CHICKEN RUN as some of my favorite animated features. Tom Hank s voices Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll owned by a boy named Andy who is the most-played toy until a space ranger, Buzz (Tim Allen) comes along and Woody is not good friends with them. But one day later, a mean toy-hating man who owns a collection of mutant toys and tries to threaten Buzz, and it is up to Woody to save Buzz with the help of the mutants before it's too late to escape to Andy's new house. The sequel is better than the original, but TOY STORY is a good movie. **** Cool A MUST see; I saw this movie when i was 5 years old a long time ago and I was so obsessed with Buzz Lightyear! I had toys of buzz Lightyear and carried them around anywhere i went.I saw this movie yesterday again and it was fabulous! plain fabulous. The story was amazing and the characters were well made! Nice job Pixar, You done it again! Tom Hanks did well doing a voice of Woody and same with Tim Allen with Buzz. I didn't really like Wall.E i almost fell asleep but this movie kept me awake the whole time with excitement! I recommend this movie to anyone no matter what age you are because this movie Just Beautiful! An fantastic awesome 10/10 The recent 3-D version of Toy Story just adds to a great experience!; When this initial computer animated movie first came out in November of 1995, I was stoked to watch this especially after watching a little behind the scenes short about it at Walt Disney World and besides, my birthday was near. What a wonderful experience what with the funny moments as well as touching ones and some intense ones concerning that sadistic kid Sid. And the use of many established comic talents like Don Rickles, Annie Potts, John Ratzenberger (who would become a regular Pixar voice), the late Jim Varney, and especially, Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. And as with previous Disney animated features, Randy Newman provides such an enjoyably compelling music score as well as several enjoyable songs with a great theme song in \"You've Got a Friend in Me\" that he warbled with Lyle Lovett. And the recent 3-D version just adds to the experience! So while this and Toy Story 2 is still (in its fourth week) playing as a double feature in theatres (with an entertaining 10-minute intermission of trivia and many other extras), I recommend you rush to the next showing as soon as you can! Greatest childhood memory; This movie reminds me of my childhood. I used to watch this movie almost everyday. This is great for kids and adults as well. I remember my whole family watching this movie. We used to sit together by the t.v. and have some quality family time. That was around the time when everyone seemed so busy with their lives. But this movie brought us all together. We were able to let go of everything and watch this movie. I show this to my baby brother and he loves this series. Whenever I hear the theme song I am brought back to the time of family bonding. When everybody had time for this particular movie. I still enjoy watching this movie at this age. I gave it a ten because it has helped me through so many times, it has been there through so many problems. I loved this movie and would recommend this movie to everyone. This review is to honor the movie the way it deserves to be honored. *This review has been stretched and has been dramatized to make the 10 line requirement. Just know that I really love the movie. That's about it* One of the best children's (and adult!) Disney animation ever created.; Toy Story is and will always be one of the best children's and adult's Disney animation ever created. As a parent, you dread seeing the same animated movies over and over again (kids never get bored seeing the same movie many times), but this one is different. I've lost track how many times I've seen it and it's just as enjoyable as the first time I saw it. Tom Hanks' voice is perfect for Woody, as is Tim Allen's as Buzz Lightyear and Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head. Love this movie and I don't think I will ever get bored seeing it. It's a perfect 10/10 from me. One of the Best Animated Films Ever!; Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen.  The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer.  The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen.  The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year).  Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with. The masterpiece that started it all; I remember seeing Toy Story opening night in 1995. 5 years have passed since then, and this movie is still awesome. I have matured in those years, but this film has not lost it's impact. It's so addictive to watch and so much fun. It has a wonderful voice cast, great animation, and an overall great story. It's a film I will watch for years, and it's one of my favorite modern animation films When toys attack.. or have fun.. or escape..; A classic. I enjoyed this, and the actual toys of Buzz when I was younger, and now I just rewatched the movie and I'm very glad that I did. Weird, it's almost Halloween, and this is far from horror. Anywho, this is one of the films that got people to know, There's a company named Pixar and they're going to rock the world of film and animation as you know it. This movie could be one of Pixar's best. Andy is moving and his toys are coming with him. But he gets a new toy for his birthday, but a week before since he wants to have his party before he move. His new toy.. Buzz Lightyear! And Woody is jealous because he could not be the favorite toy. But before you know it, Woody is lost on the way to a Pizza place when he was supposed to be going with Andy, and Buzz is joining on the ride. Now they must get to Andy before he moves.. or while he's moving. Oops, spoiled. A great animation. Really shows you why some choose 3d animation over traditional animation. Hey, you wouldn't want to see toy story as a 2d cartoon? Do you?  This movie was one of the best 3d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an 8.5.(I gave it an 8) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of 3d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! One of the most watchable(&amp; re-watchable) movies ever.; This movie has it all. Simple enough for children to enjoy, and yet with enough subtle humour for adults to enjoy as well. In fact, this film was made more for adults than for children I suspect-much of the humour is subtle and adult oriented, and as the makers admit, many of the toys are ones they played with in their childhoods. The toys in the film are actually better actors, and convey more emotion, than most \"actors\" in films today. Kudos to Pixar for an excellent job. A must-see film, it has something for everyone, and loses nothing on repeated viewing. I saw it 3 times at the cinema, and then bought it on video, and have probably seen it 50 or so times at home, and yet it is still funny, and I will happily watch it again.  My childhood!; I love this film. It has a few flaws. It doesn't look nearly as well as it did upon release. But I'll never forget watching this classic in the cinema. Pixar had a solid group of films dating over a decade (Cars not included), but I can always re-visit. Thanks Pixar for this brilliant premiere of a gem and for: - A Bug's Life - Monsters, Inc. - Toy Story 2 - Finding Nemo - The Incredibles - Ratatouille - WALL-e - Up - Toy Story 3 Yep! a wonderfully innovative movie; truly a delight; Clever, heartwarming story centers around a group of living toys and their perspectives on the world they inhabit, one in which attention from their owner is the essence of their very existence. An old-fashioned cowboy doll and longtime favorite of his child owner is threatened by the arrival of a sophisticated, high-tech space ranger. Despite their differences, they eventually realize that they need each other in order to overcome a dangerous predicament. On the surface it's the first film ever done completely with computer animation, but at its heart is a compelling story of friendship, love, and acceptance. Terrific songs, remarkable animation, and a perfect cast of voices make this an engaging experience for all ages. A family film and so much more. ***½ Toy Story 9/10, Toy Story 3-D 5/10- rip off; Let me explain. I love films. Toy Story is beyond excellent. Toy Story 3-D is perhaps the biggest con since Keyser Soze convinced the world he didn't exist. There is ONE SCENE in the whole film where you actually get the sense of 3-D and that is right at the end during a snow scene. If you have Toy Story on DVD or have seen it before, stay at home because you are seeing nothing new here. The thing that annoys me is that in addition to paying to see the same film that I own on DVD, I paid extra for 3-D glasses!! unbelievable!! it should've been a highway mans mask and a club. I implore you to stay away from this and Toy Story 2 3-D when it is out as I am sure they will just do the same again. Hands Down My Favorite Disney FIlm.; I just recently saw the Toy Story, Toy Story 2 double feature and it was amazing seeing this movie on the big screen after all this time. In my opinion this is the best movie Pixar has made so far, and it will be hard to top it. The animation is flawless and all of the characters are so lovable, you actually forgot that they are toys and not real people. The plot is actually really inventive and the idea of toys being jealous of one another is really fun. I think this movie is perfect for people of any age because the humor can be enjoyed by anyone. Obviously it's the perfect movie for kids, but it's great for adults too. Tim Allen and Tom Hanks lend their voices as the main characters in this film, and they are perfect in it. Overall, this movie is genuine animated classic! Created a decade ago, but still stunning; I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago. The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their \"leader\" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other... When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10. Hanks and Allen are hilarious even animated!; As if Tom Hanks wasn't talented enough...someone had the brilliant idea to animate him! Not to mention pair Hanks great sense of humor with comedic genius Tim Allen! Together, these two keep the giggles and laughs coming in this cute and successful Disney Pixar flick that spawned an even cuter sequal! Best Animated Film Ever!!!!; This is one of the best animated films I ever seen! It will always be better than the other two Toy Story films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are so good in the Toy Story franchise. Woody's sarcasm is the best part of the film as well as Buzz not knowing he's a toy. The story of this film is just something you wouldn't expect but then it is about toys, so it all makes sense. I will always recommend this film and the rest of the franchise to friends and family. To Infinity and Beyond! My favorite film as a kid and remains a classic today; As a kid, I remember watching the first two Toy Story films frequently and collecting all the characters from the movie. I found out that it was the very first computer-animated film about two years ago and assumed that's why the movie is still so popular. Woody and Buzz are what made the film what it was then and today and were my favorite characters. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is where Woody and Buzz are launched in the air from the rocket and Buzz frees himself to fly into Andy's toy box. The film remains a classic and always will be to me. I also cannot wait for the third movie to come out June 18, 2010 because I'll be the first in line. The film of a child's dream; All I can say is that I started my childhood with this film. And I can remember that my hole day i was thinking of the film in the clouds I could picture the film, in my dream i kept thinking of it. I say that this film completed a kids dream. And in the future I will surly show this film to my kids and if they didn't like it ..... well they must like it!!!! I started to learn English after I sow this film. And every time I remember my childhood and this film I could cry. So I am asking you to watch this movie and please make your kids watch it with you. And I really want a third film for toy story. And thanks for the producers for doing two parts of this film. If ever a movie was perfect, this is it.; Never mind that it's a kiddie movie.  It's a pioneer film from Walt Disney and worth seeing just on that merit alone.  The whole concept of the toys lends itself perfectly to the new medium of computer animation, not to mention the incredible marketing of it's toys. The plot and the dialogue keep producing laughter faster than Disney's releases of re-releases.  The end sequence ties in perfect with the open sequence, opening presents.  In fact, the whole concept was so solid, that the movie would have been just as successful if no big names had been cast.  Not that I'm complaining, I'm a fan of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, too.  But when you look  back at all the hoopla of the film, you kind of forget them.  You won't forget Buzz and Woody! Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition); Tom Hanks is an amazing animated movie with a well written script that is about the secret life of toys. The centers around Andy and his toys. Andy has a long time favorite toy named woody. Woody likes his situation till Andy gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear and Woodys situation changes forever, or so it seems to Woody. The animation is astounding considering that it was done over ten years ago (1995). I highly recommend this movie and I consider it one of the best animated made ever. The songs are a bit sappy but perfect for animated movies and the music is right on par. I definitely without a doubt give this movie 5 stars. Toy Story is the greatest Disney movie ever in my opinion! Looking forward to Toy Story 3 in two years!; There is absolutely no question about it, Disney/Pixar's 1995 hit film, Toy Story, is their absolutely best film in my opinion. Pixar, the visual effects studio based in Northern California, was best known for making short films with three dimensional technology, including some Oscar winning shorts. In 1992 a script called Toy Story was completed and Pixar decided to take on the challenge of creating the world's first fully computer animated motion picture. In 1995, that script came to life, and the rest is history. Not only was Toy Story a gigantic hit for Disney and Pixar, it started series of films that continues to amaze and bewilder children and adults of all ages. The animation was state of the art, and continues to look amazing to this day. The characters, Woody, and Buzz Lightyear, to the humor were all amazing. Pixar won a special Oscar for making the first computer animated film, and it led to many more films of it's type to this day. Pixar, don't make us wait, please give millions of children around the world what we desperately need, more adventures of Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Here's to many more Toy Story films in the future, including the upcoming Toy Story 3 coming in three years, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen returning as Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Bona Fide Genius; What can I say that has not been said about this superb piece of work? Pixar have redefined what animation is all about. The concept, the story, the writing and the voice-overs could hardly be bettered. The toys are real individual characters brought to believable life by the actors who voice them. Special mention for Tom Hanks as you really cannot separate his voice from Woody's character. It works on every level. Kids love it, as do teenagers, young adults and pensioners like me too. The songs by Randy Newman are not too intrusive and actually enhance the story and move it on too. The amount of work that must have gone into the brainstorming before production started must have been amazing. It would have been great to have an insight into all that. Everyone should be made to watch this - it has a lot to say about life and relationships. Best computer animated movie of it's time!; This is an all time classic movie. The characters can really hold the your attention. The bright colors are wonderful. There is never a dull moment in this film especially with Woody. The toy characters are so great an funny. I love the banter between Mr &amp; Mrs Potato Head. Buzz Lightyear is also an awesome character who is very courageous! This is a fantastic film I am a really big fan of Tom Hanks! A Toy in the making of another and more toys; Excellent voice match to character in movie. Could have more art and less same images repeat. Pixar is now faster than ever; 1995 a slower speed for animated film. Will watch again, but not over and over again, consecutively. Liked it on Facebook, happy go lucky and not afraid to be bold. Don't understand the likes and dislikes but willing to accept all criticism. My own personal review may be liked or may be disliked. The clearness and accurate manner for beautiful taste in dual role models for example Sid the evil kid whom abuses toys and Andy the kid who doesn't like to play rough. However, Sid's sister is quite an opposite to Sid as well; she being a girl and has a love for tea parties with her closest doll Friends. The jokes and laughter in \"Toy Story\" is what made this turn of a century animated film a door-buster into the the first \"digital\" animated films in history. Of course, one does grow old and the story is great passed on to your children in just about any house hold! this movie is awesome!the humor never bores!; i remember when this movie came out in 1995. i was seven at the time. i have loved it since day 1. actors such as tom hanks and tim allen bring sparkle to the show. they are both hillarious as woody and buzz. this movie is directed at both kids and adults. the humor never goes flat and it is never cheesy or corny. if you are a fan of tom hanks and tim allen or you just want a good laugh, than you shoud definitely watch this movie. you will not regret it. ********** out of **********. Not to be missed!!!!; This is probably the best effort Disney has ever put into a movie and it shows! The animation can not be faulted (I even noticed reflections in polished wood tables when the toys walk across them!) the attention to detail in this digital world was brilliant. The characters were hilarious and I still laugh in all the same places after multiple viewings. It's a movie about friendship and doing the right thing after you make a mistake. A valuable lesson for young children. The jokes for adults are spot on aswell such as the quick \"Blink and you'll miss it\" scene where Mr Potatohead mocks another toy by taking his mouth off and patting his rear end with it. The word \"A##kisser!\" immediately came to mind and I laughed for ages at that alone! It was also subtle enough for young children watching to miss it altogether which shows how cleverly this movie was put together. Can't wait for the sequel! 10/10 even better than Bug's Life (another Disney / Pixar collaboration) and that's high praise indeed!  The one that started it all; Toy Story is a gem of a movie from Pixar that is still as visually impressive today as it was when it was originally released over a decade ago. Computer animation was a new thing at the time but Toy Story proved that the medium was more than a novelty act and was going to be around for a while. Woody (Tom Hanks) is Andy's favorite toy until Buzz Lightyear, a spaceman voiced by Tim Allen, arrives on the scene. To quote Randy Newman's song from the film, strange things begin to happen to Woody when he loses popularity with the other toys and is accused of trying to kill Buzz out of jealousy. Soon things go awry for the toys when Sid, Andy's sadistic neighbor, gets a hold of Woody and Buzz. The toys have to learn to work together and forge an alliance in order to survive. Great story and voice acting all around makes Toy Story a classic. 9 out of 10. Mesmerized..; When I first watched the film, I was in love with movies. This is one of those films that one can watch again and again. All things apart, the most dazzling part of the film are its story. And when you mix it with mind blowing dialog delivery (voice over), then you serve an exceptional beauty for anime lovers. The voice over of woody by Tom hanks is the best that I have ever heard in any animation film. The story is the best in so many of the animation films till today. There is nothing in the film that you might dislike. The toy story series serves the true purpose of films which is to make people forget about their day to day worries. The characters in the film are an absolute delight to watch. Each and every character is designed so nicely with their respective roles that I am in love with the series. The essence of the film is simple and has been conveyed in an easy way. Looking forward for more films like these. \"A must watch for everyone, and especially kids.\" a movie that you will be talking about; this is a movie that you will be talking about i never saw a movie like this ever Toy Story is one amazing movie this is a movie that everyone will be talking about if you like Toy Story 2 and 3 than you you will like the first one it is a laugh out laud movie i never saw a movie like this ever it is outstanding it is a sweet movie go see this amazing movie today i never saw a movie quite like this ever it is like a dream come true this is the perfect family film it is a great movie for the kids to enjoy even if your kids are 13 14 15 16 17 18 or 19 they will still enjoy this amazing movie go see this 4 out of 4 star movie and a two thumbs up movie it is that good of a movie you have to go see Toy Story it is a must see for everyone it is a hoot there is nothing like this movie i am serious there is nothing like this movie it is one of a kind it is the best movie ever created i think so it is hilarious i laugh so hard it was that funny it should be called the number 1 movie in the world have a great day everyone Scmaltz-tastic 3D adventure ride falls a little flat over the years; I just watched Toy Story for only the 3rd time since it was first in the theaters, and as much as I liked a lot of the movie, it fizzles out over time for me. It's a very cute movie, mainly for kids, but it has a few chuckles thrown in for adults. The human characters in the movie didn't seem very realistic; their happy-go-lucky, suburban lifestyle just made them very flat and barely likable, especially if you grew up in a family unable to afford multiple toys. The voice actors were delightful, and their moods were directed very well, even for the plastic Army-men who don't show much emotion. The \"cannibal toys\" were very imaginative and creepy, so they served their purpose well. I thought the idea of the claw machine that housed the little green aliens was cute, how \"The Claw\" was their Messiah of sorts. The coloring in the film was vivid and incorporated some awesome day-glow tones that I had forgotten about over time. The ultimate reason to watch the movie is to witness Pixar's astounding use of 3D imagery, especially when they incorporate real-life effects onto the screen (i.e. The magnifying lens over Woody's face). There were some aspects of the film I didn't care for. The movie is only 77 minutes long without the prefaced, short 3D movie before it, making the story suffer and seem a little lacking. I found the music to be over-the-top schmaltzy and generic, but it is primarily for kids and the Disney crowd, so I guess it belongs here. Again, the character of Andy isn't very likable, other than the fact that he owns a lot of older toys that we made have seen commercials of as a kid. The story wasn't very mind-blowing, but from the vantage point of a toy on the run, it is imaginative enough. It's the typical Indiana Jones setting where the main characters always find a way to turn their two-steps forward into one-step back. The ending with the falling through the sunroof was very convenient and could've easily been the start of another obstacle they needed to face, for example. In the end, I like the movie for its presentation, but as a film, I was not blown away with originality or anything by its story. The messages that it sends about jealousy, envy, depression, fear, and questions about one's worthiness to another are the primary focuses throughout the movie, but it ends up just being another nicely tied-up package in the end, which is Disney for you. 5 stars. Perfect! A badge to be worn proudly by Pixar.; Of course my opinion, but truly,honestly perfect! It is an amazing standalone, kid, and Pixar film with all the great motifs of all. It teaches children good values about who are in the world, and mortality. It also appeals to all ages and has incredible animation for 1995, and also was great enough to be unforgotten all the way until now 2015, 20 years later. Buzz's realization that he is just another product to be sold in the world, is in my opinion, one of the greatest moments of movie and entertainment history. The movie gives you a lot of things to speculate on like is Woody a bad toy? Or can a movie have virtually no villain but the hero or at all? The choice is 100% yours and that is what I love most about the movie. It is absolutely timeless and unforgettable and I highly suggest watching it. Super family movie!; Toy Story is truly a pioneer of this type of movie. I don't know what it's really called but I think digital animation best describes it. From here, you have all the Shrek, etc. derivatives. Not only is the film irresistibly funny it is also has a clever story and unlike many movies of today you can watch this one over and over. The voices are done by a host of popular names that we all know and love. Some of the most popular being Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, and John Ratzenberger as Hamm. Jim Varney even lends his hilarious voice as Slinky the Dog. The story is about a boy (Andy) that gets a new toy (Buzz Lightyear) for his birthday. Andy's previous favorite toy (Woody) feels forgotten. After a series of mis-adventures the two find themselves away from the home and must learn to work together to find their way back. The film is followed by a sequel \"Toy Story 2\" and \"Toy Story 3\" which were just as awesome, if not more so than this one. 9/10 easily The cartoon that started it all.; I am not a kid but a kid at heart. Toy Story is one of the best animated movies around. This is the most creative movie for kids and adults. Toy Story 2 is better story than the first one, but equally imaginative in computer graphics. \"I'm not really from Mattel...I'm from a smaller company purchased in a leveraged buyout.\"; A kid's bedroom full of toys comes to life when humans aren't around; each toy, both new and retro-vintage, has his or her own individual personality, and they're all thrilled to meet the new member of the pack, birthday present Buzz Lightyear, who just may usurp Sheriff Woody in their pre-teen owner's heart. Disney/Pixar computer-generated cartoon has witty writing and incredible visuals to spare, though some scenes are heavy with chatter and the climactic race to catch up to a moving van is stretching things, even for a kid's picture. Still, some of the lines (which fly by at top speed) are very sharp and funny, and the star-voices (particularly Tim Allen's as Buzz) are uncanny. **1/2 from **** Entertaining for all; Cleverly crafted Disney production has plenty to laugh at for both younger and more mature audiences. The innovative idea creates a world in which children's toys come to life in their own universe; the bedroom. While the animation is not exactly state of the art any more, the pic benefits from some jovial, whole-hearted performances. Especially of note is the irrepressible Tom hanks as Woody, Andy's favourite toy (until now), and Tim Allen, hilariously deadpan as space ranger Buzz Lightyear, the new guy in town. The comedy stays fresh and lively throughout while there is always something happening to keep little eyes tuned. Infinitely watchable, as Disney often is. Tuesday, December 1, 1998 - Video Imaginative Breakthrough.; Toy Story (1995): Dir: John Lasseter / Voices: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Jim Varney: Breakthrough first fully computer animated film and what a wondrous triumphant visual thrill it is. It is a film for families that will appeal on different grounds depending on age. It regards a cowboy named Woody and the jealousy that erupts when Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear enters the room on their owner's birthday. Buzz is interesting because he doesn't realize that he is a toy. When Woody causes Buzz to fall out a window an adventure begins that eventually lands them both in nasty Sid's bedroom from next door where a dire fate awaits toys. Grand idea with imaginative filmmaking by director John Lasseter. Where the film goes wrong is its placing supporting characters as types with little purpose. The two leads carry the film with Tom Hanks voicing Woody who goes from important to jealousy to hero in an exciting climax. Tim Allen as Buzz brings much humour in his inability to accept what he is. There is a host of other toys that seem more like fillers. Don Rickles voices Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn voices T-Rex. Jim Varney of Ernest P. Worrell fame voices the loyal Slinky Dog. It contains a theme of love and friendship and for adults it addresses the future of films. Grand achievement, or as the toys put it, \"To infinity and beyond!\" Score: 9 / 10 A fantastic family film.; The plot:A wooden cowboy doll called Woody is a young boy's favourite toy, yet when his owner gets a space toy of an astronaut called Buzz Lightyear, Woody has been left out of his owner's daily live. Woody finds out that Buzz Lightyear thinks that he really is a space ranger.     Both toys are now fighting each other while being kidnaped by the next door nieghbour that hates toys and must work together to get back to their owner before they are destroyed. The view:A wonderful enchanting and nicely funny story about rivally between two toys that are animated very well, with the fact of the movie being the first that was computer animated, this movie is really for everyone that enjoys watching a film that the whole family will delight in. Great fun. **** Timeless; Here's another film I watched back-to-back every day for a couple of weeks, when I was younger. I recently picked up the DVD and was instantly pulled in again. I ended up watching it again two days later. Anyway, I must point out that watching it when you're a child and watching it when you're an adult will result in two different experiences. Watching it recently I laughed my arse off at jokes I didn't even know were jokes back then; even simple things like \"Buzz LightBeer\" can have quite an impact. Alright then, enough of that. The film is 100% perfect the way it is. The characters are so full of personality, so full of humanity, and how it perfectly expresses emotions of loneliness, rejection, and love through a couple of toys is astounding. The movie has a sort of episodic appeal to it, wherein each episode leads to one collective end. It also seems that the worst that can happen to our protagonists does happen. It makes for one unpredictable plot. There's plenty of darkness here, especially with the whole Sid scenario, or when Buzz tries to fly. Did I mention the soundtrack? Randy Newman was perfect for this job; the music has a childish aura to it, but also helps accentuate the emotions of certain scenes. Can't imagine why he wasn't asked to work on the sequel. Anyway, Toy Story has received countless awards, and it is my opinion they are deserved. The Best Kids Movie of the 90's; Despite being the first full-length computer-animated movie, the movie's strengths are its plot and characterization.  The technology is not thrust in your face and simply serves to support a truly excellent animated film. A classic. Proof that Pixar not only cares about the quality of their work,they care about our kids.; Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library. my Personal Favorite of Pixar's Work; I remember seeing this film at the ripe age of seven, and I was totally entranced by it. What kid would not have been attracted to that sweet of a premise? Released way back in 1999, it was totally different from the usual hand drawn animation, and yet still as vibrant, if not more so. Even now as an 18 year old dude I find it so amazing. Attention to detail has always been Lasseter's strong suit, among many I might add. But the greatest thing about this film was the life evoked into its unique and untouchable characters. With the voice talents of Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, as well as the hilarious Don Rickles, and the late Jim Varney, the voice acting was perfect and the dialogue was surprisingly intelligent throughout. What could be perceived more or less as a simple story is told with heart and humor, one that hasn't aged a bit since that first viewing. I still own my original VHS copy in fact, but perhaps it's time I buy it on Blu-ray or DVD. Cynical and disturbing; This is one film that left me with a very sour aftertaste.  Yes, it's animated with character and vigour, and there are some fine -- if over the top -- voice performances.  However, there are some very disturbing aspects to the film.  The first is that it's like nothing so much as watching a 90 minute advert.  Even if merchandising hadn't been released to support the film, all the supporting cast could already by bought in your local toy shop.  I'm sure I wasn't the only viewer who found this more than a little suspect. Possible spoiler: The second, perhaps larger, point against the film lies in the characterisation of the two boys, Andy and Sid.  Andy is the \"good\" boy. He plays safely and passively with his toys, they don't do anything toys wouldn't do.  Sid, the \"bad\" boy is more creative.  He adapts toys to fit his own vision, he's an innovator, a creator.  It's this very creativity of his that is portrayed as a bad thing.  Sid isn't the ideal target audience for this film: he wouldn't be satisfied with row after row of identical shop-bought toys, he would much rather make his own.  I guess this review is being written for all the Sids out there, who are demonised and vilified by this ultra-corporate nightmare of a film. You've got a friend in me; \"Reach for the sky\"! The opening statement of Woody (Hanks) a toy cowboy during a boys playtime. A statement that proves to be ironic when he later looks up at a toy from space, Buzz Lightyear (Allen). Woody's owner is growing older and Woody struggles to accept the change as Buzz becomes Andy's new favourite toy. Leading from the once strong leader into a bout of jealousy and even malice as he tries to take Buzz out of the picture. Woody is then separated from Andy via a fight with Buzz and has to find a way home. Further change occurs as Woody is forced to align with Buzz to escape the toy antagonist Sid. It takes 3/4 of the movie for Woody to finally change his ways, and work with Buzz for the final great escape. Woody's journey from leader to outcast to redemption is intriguing to watch unfold. His final monologue with Sid was beautifully written as the toy out wits the boy. The whole irony of his story is that a child's mind is fleeting and 10 minutes of playing with Buzz and Woody would have been in the game again. For me it is Buzz that follows the greater path of change. Noble and confident throughout mostly due to being under the illusion he is an actual space ranger. Kudos to the writer who decided to take a toy from this world and make him believe he is real! Simple but incredibly compelling. Buzz's final realisation that he is a toy is arm breaking for him but heartbreaking for us. For a family movie Buzz's breakdown is surprising and well delivered and the journey back to being he hero has Buzz literally \"Reaching for the sky\". With us the viewers figuratively as we are up there with them cheering the final events. Woody and Buzz's journey home is supported by a cast of toys, each with a filled out personality. Loyal Slinky being one of my favourites, always reluctant to turn on his buddy Woody like the others. It's the direction of John Lasseter that puts us into this world. When Woody shouts \"You are a toy\". It's John speaking to us. From the beginning the camera is at ground level. We are not supposed to be a child watching his toys come to life but an actual toy, low level shots panning up throughout give a feel to the vastness of a toys world. We are right there through each playtime, adventure, triumph and failure and by the end Buzz may be flying but we are falling for these toys, in style. The story and characters are a success but the triumph is the medium in which the story is told. Through 3d animation, never before seen feature length. The Pixar animators made a bedroom and a pizza planet truly realistic. They brought toys to life in movement and texture. But most astonishing of all, they made us care for a bunch of 3d shapes put together through countless hours of rendering in a computer. The result is a metaphor for change, not just in the story itself and it's characters but in the medium it is told. The great change from 2d to 3d animation which is now common place for feature animation. This movie is a game changer for cinema and animation alike. Walt Disney and co did it in 1938. 54 years later John Lasseter and co did it again. The possibilities for 3d animation in film are Infinite, and Beyond...? Another Childhood Favorite!!!; I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since. It has a great storyline. Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, and many more. On Andy's Birthday, he receives a Buzz Lightyear action hero, and Woody becomes jealous because he isn't Andy's favorite anymore. When Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, his friends want nothing to do with him. On the way to Pizza Planet, Buzz confronts him in the family van, and knocks him outside and the family drive off without them. They go through a lot trying to get back to Andy before they move. When they end up in Sid's room, the kid who tortures toys, Woody and Buzz must work together in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TOY STORY!!! On it's 20th Birthday, Toy Story still soars To Infinity and Beyond!; In 1989, Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help. They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as \"Toy Story\", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about. First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the \"I'm Mrs Nesbitt\" sequence and the \"You Are A Toy\" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies \"You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic \"To Infinity and Beyond\" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history. There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's 81 minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" and \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" hit the right notes by being memorable songs. Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school. Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late 2000s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy 20th Birthday. Absolute perfection!; Hard to believe it but this, one of my all-time favorite movies, is already five years old.  And you know what, it's aged beautifully. Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest animated films of all time.  And not only that but it's also one of the funniest comedies (animated or otherwise) ever written.  I remember when this first came to theaters and everyone came to see the animation.  Don't get me wrong, \"Toy Story\" would still get a solid ten (if only the ratings went to 11) on eye-candy value alone.  However, the thing that gets me watching it over and over is the script. In short, this is the one animated movie that's *almost* more quotable than \"the Breakfast Club\". I can't imagine that there are people out there that haven't yet seen \"Toy Story\", even though I've met a few.  Go watch it, already!  You can thank me later. This movie is *perfect*. Instant Classic; Every company has that one movie that puts them on the map. That is what Toy Story did for Pixar. Toy Story is a cartoon about a little boy's toy collection that is alive when the little boy is not around. His name is Andy and he loves his toys, and they love him back. Woody is a cowboy and is Andy's favorite toy. The toys always get worried every Christmas and birthday because they fear they will be replaced by a bigger and better toy. The story starts off with Andy's birthday party and all of the toys are on edge. It turns out that a new toy by the name of Buzz Lightyear challenges Woody as the favorite toy. Buzz comes along, steals a little bit of the spotlight and Woody gets incredibly jealous. Eventually Woody and Buzz get lost and must find their way home and back to Andy before he and his family move away forever. Let's start with the toys. I loved these toys. Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Little Bow Peep, Woody, Buzz, Slink, Ham, and even Etch-a-Sketch are the main toys and each are lovable and different. Rex is hilarious because he is ironic. He is a dinosaur but he is a wimp, and he is my favorite of the toys. I remember watching as a little kid and I was always excited to see Rex on screen. Each character has their individual role. There are also toys every kid can relate with and that make the movie special. For example, the barrel of monkeys, the small soldiers, the etch-a-sketch, and Mr. Potato Head are toys every kid used to play with. The smaller toys aren't really relevant for long but when they are seen in the beginning and end of the movie their impact is huge. One of the major themes in the story is jealousy and the relationship between Woody and Buzz. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the favorite toy. Woody is a cowboy with a pull string that says some catch phrases. The other toys look up to him, he is a hero, and Andy loved him with all his heart. Andy dresses up like a cowboy, has Woody posters, and is obsessed with this toy. Woody embraces the love; it defines him, gives him confidence, and confirms that he is the leader. Then Buzz Lightyear comes into the picture with his better quality of a toy. He doesn't have a pull string, but a button Andy presses to have a better sound quality voice box will speak catch phrases. He is made of plastic, which is more durable and he has wings pop out which can simulate flight. Woody becomes incredibly jealous of Buzz and fights for Andy's love. He eventually knocks him out the window. Toy Story may be a kid's movie but it has an interesting and entertaining premise, especially with its characterization. Woody and Buzz both develop into better and stronger characters. Woody goes from a pompous, jealous, selfish, toy, into a respectable and lovable character. He and Buzz become best friends and inseparable, a little cliché, but it's a movie for families so it's perfect. When Buzz first appeared he thought he was a real \"space ranger.\" He was convinced that he was not a toy, he could really fly, and he had a dangerous \"laser\" which was really a blinking light bulb. He develops and he eventually accepts the fact that he is a toy but he is a \"cool toy.\" He is \"Andy's toy.\" Woody admits his jealousy to Buzz and that becomes a turning point in their relationship. We have our villain in the movie, Sid. This kid is just evil. He is a spoiled kid who \"terrorizes toys, just for fun.\" One scene we the toys in Andy's room watch him as he straps firecrackers to a Commander Carl and it explodes. First of all, what kind of nine or ten year old kid plays with explosives? If he isn't nine or ten, what is he doing playing with kid toys? He may tear them apart and put different parts on them, making them scary and horrific for children to even see on screen, that just doesn't make sense. His character fits for a children's movie but in reality a kid like this would never exist in real life. Sid is really my only problem with the movie, but still a character needed for the film. Overall, Toy Story is a classic and put Pixar on the map and was the beginning of a highly successful company. It came out in the 1995 and families everywhere fell in love, including me. It is a movie that can be watched again and again no matter what age. It is a movie kids will show their children when they are older. Teenagers lined up to see Toy Story 3 years later because it meant so much to them back when they were little. Toy Story and its characters left a rare imprint on the hearts of people all over the world. Without a doubt, Toy Story gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and goes down as one of my personal all time favorite animation movies. Toy Story; The story is about toys. The boy who named Andy has toys and enjoys playing with them. To be surprised, their toys can talk and act freely. Nobody of human know the fact. Woody who is Andy's cowboy toy spends a good time, however, Andy's new toy appear for Woddy. The toy's name is Buzz Lightyear. Woody and Buzz fight all the time and loses sight of their family and toys. They tries a lot of ways to meet their family and toys. The film is a long film by Pixar Animation Studious. The genre of the movie is animation, comedy and fantasy. It has dialogue and colors. It has sound effect and it is good to use the way of music. I like the scene that Woody and Buzz success in getting into a car that Andy rides. The film can be enjoyed by only children but also adults. cute; The movie is so cute. The story is about toys. A lot of people had a lot of toys when they were young or they may still have some toys yet. Also, a lot of children have a lot of toys now. Therefore a lot of people can enjoy watching this movie. Not only children but also adult and elder people are interested in the story. There are always a lot of toys around us, so we don't think about toys a lot. \"Toy Story\" indicates toys' feeling. If we use our toys rough, toys may be sad. If we cherish our toys, toys may be happy. By watching this movie, the audience can understand about toys. It is good movie. Children in the movie is young, so people who go to kindergarten or elementary school know how to treat their toys by watching the movie. After watching this movie, I love my toys and I notice that it is important for me. Best Disney ever; Finally a Disney movie which isn't moralistic but just fun to watch. Also it doesn't have the boring \"sing-along-songs\" so this movie is also a perfect movie for anybody about 10 years and (much) older. I really liked the computer-generated graphics because the characters moved very smoothly, something which can't be done the original way. More of these masterpieces in the future please and I will really like Disney at last, but dont't make it to moralistic and musical. That this movie is above all the other Disney -movies in the IMDB top 250 is proof of that. Good, Creative charm for kids and adults!; I'm not a huge fan of animated films, so coming into Toy Story I had very low expectations. At first, I thought it was Meh. Then, as the movie progressed it got better and better. Buzz is funny, Woody is a good cowboy, Sid is awesomely evil. Toy Story has an amazing cast as well. I mean, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, AND the Amazing Don RICKLES as Mr. Potato Head! Toy Story keeps kids and adults on their feet and I'm praising it so much because I have never seen any ANIMATED film as good as Toy Story so far. Disney really worked their magic into this classic. Toy Story FTW. I'm going to go rent Toy Story 2, and see if this film series has advanced even further. Pixar kick ass!; Yap. Those talented people at Pixar shows us that computer animation can be just as alive and creative as drawn animation. People think that the computer \"does all the hard work\", but that's not true. 3D animation can be just as difficult, if not more. The voice talent people are great and the animated characters clicked well with the pre-recorded voices. Everything from the toys' facial expressions to body postures is done well, but the real success of the movie comes from a perfect script. As long as the same creative team sticks around, I wouldn't mind ENDLESS sequels to TOY STORY. Cute Family Movie; Toy Story is a great movie for children and adults. Children will enjoy it simply because it is a cartoon. They will find it exciting because it shows toys coming to life which is something every child pretends with their toys. It's a good movie for children because it teaches them about jealousy, friendship, and teamwork. Adults will appreciate the animation and the accuracy of the details in the toys. Most of the toys used in this film were ones most people had as children. Such as, Mr. Potato head, the slinky dog, etch-a-sketch, and the army men. The theme of Toy Story is friendship. The movies theme song was titled \"You've Got a Friend in Me\". The friendship in this movie is about overlooking insecurities and finding a true friend in someone that you think would be your biggest enemy. A 2001 movie called Monsters Inc. is directed around this same theme. A little girl named Boo should be afraid of the monsters as much as the monsters are afraid of her but they form a friendship that overcomes their differences. Toy Story is about the lives of toys owned by a boy named Andy. Andy is having a birthday and he gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear. Andy's toys worry about him getting new toys because they are afraid they will get lost or donated. With the arrival of Buzz, Woody fills that Andy will like Buzz better. He tries to lose Buzz but instead he accidentally knocks him out of a window. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were brilliantly matched for being the voices of Woody and Buzz Lightyear. The personalities of the actors and characters seemed to be a perfect fit. The other toys in the movie, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky dog (Jim Varney), Pig named Ham(John Ratzenberger), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), and Bo Peep(Annie Potts), feel like Woody did this on purpose because he was jealous of the attention Buzz was getting from Andy. In order to make things right Woody realizes he needs to get Buzz back. Woody and Buzz both wind up separated from Andy and this is where their adventure begins. From this point on they work together to get back to Andy's before his family moves. Along the way Buzz realizes that he is not a space ranger but a toy. Woody tries to help Buzz understand that he is not just a toy and that he is very important to children. Woody convinces Buzz that they must get back to Andy. At the conclusion of the movie, Buzz and Woody are helping each other make it on the moving truck. They finally make it next to Andy who is excited to see both of them. Toy Story is about the friendship that is formed between Woody and Buzz. Once Woody was able to get passed his insecurities he realized that Andy could have two favorite toys. The motif of friendship is displayed throughout the movie by the relationships between Woody and Andy, Woody and all the other toys, and between Woody and Buzz. They also form a friendship with the strange toys at Sid's house. This movie is a true example of friendship. Really Sweet Movie!; Whether you're a fan of animated Disney movies or not, this movie is brilliant! It's great for family time movies or great for the everyday average Disney fan. The characters are put together very well. After I saw it, it made me actually think about throwing out old toys. I've been a fan of this movie ever since I was born(it was really big then) and I still watch it from time to time. I would definitely recommend this to anybody. Still Entertaining after 15 Years; I saw Toy Story in theaters in 95. As a kid it was funny, and original not just in story but in presentation. After 15 years the cg doesn't hold up in all areas. The human characters look stiff and the way background looks a bit flat. This plastic look works with toys so it doesn't become a problem. The movie holds up in every other area. The plot is engaging and the characters funny and likable. Toy Story is a family film it funny for children without talking down to them and enjoyable for adults. As a twenty something year old it is just as entertaining as when I first saw the original release. Fun for all ages; Toy Story is a classic among kids and adults, a classic among animation and simply one of the highest rated movies of all time. At first thoughts I felt yeah sure it is great but then after a little more time I came to realise this is incredible, I won't say it's 100% perfect but still it just exudes this feeling of well, fun. It's the kind of movie that only after do you really understand how Woody feels and how Buzz feels, you also realise how easy it would be to watch it again because it's really a calm but also an exciting watch. It's hard to call this a kid's movie owing to the fact that all fans of this back in the day are fully grown adults now, but the fact that they still return to this and say it is a masterpiece even today, well it shows how impressive this really is as well. The story is of course about toys, and in particular a new toy arriving because Andy the toys owner got a new Space Ranger named Buzz Lightyear for his birthday. Woody the favourite toy of Andy is jealous of Buzz's new found fame among all the other toys and starts to both feel angry but also kind of obsolete as well. The story moves along at a frantic pace, the amount of things that happen though to say this has an 81 minute run time is amazing and the timing is absolutely wonderful. Another point I found only after thinking back on the movie was the humour and how is just really good, one moment in a certain pizza restaurant arcade where we see a \"Whack-a-Alien\" game in reference to \"Alien\" sums up the overly kidult tone this movie possesses. Among the voices we have Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, Don Rickles as a small potato toy, Wallace Shawn in his trademark voice as Rex the dinosaur toy and the smoky voice of Jim Varney as Slinky the well, slinky toy dog. The voices are very memorable and the voice cast are perfectly picked, none seem out of place and maybe that is because of how much this movie has dug itself into film culture. I found Hanks and Allen's voices to be at the same level as each other only because they are both so great, Buzz is made even more courageous sounding by Allen and Hanks provides a kind of cool kind of toy voice but also brings out Woody's scared side or angry side well. John Lasseter the director is among many names behind this movie who seem to all hit the right spot with this, they create the first animated feature length picture and turn it into one of the still most popular of them all. The writers hit the movie from another flank, Lasseter brings humour out from his vision but I think the writers, Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow really bring another face to the movie where the humour but also the emotion can mix really well. As animation goes it of course does not look as it maybe did back then (still isn't bad though), although it doesn't matter anyway because it is the storytelling that blows you away and the characters really grab your attention. Pixar kicked off their stellar works in animated movies in style and brought not only a new way of making a movie, but also a fine way of telling a story and not making it over the top or just for kids, this is for everyone. There isn't too much too find wrong with this I mean, maybe some of the jokes aren't great, but really they may be still good anyway, it is kind of a movie that you can easily watch again without feeling it will quickly become boring, the kind of movie that is fun for quite literally, all the family. Great Fun For Kids And Adults Alike; Toy Story is one of those rare animated movies, designed for children, that adults can enjoy. Plot In A Paragraph: Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) is 8 year old Andy's favourite toy, however his world falls apart when Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) figure for his birthday and he has to play second fiddle to the new space ranger. I loved this movie. Over the years I have watched it with both my kids and nieces and nephews and they have all enjoyed it. Watching it now, it has lost none of its charm. Tom Hanks is superb as Woody, Tim Allen (who I'm not a fan of) is delightful as the deluded Buzz Lightyear who is not aware he is an action figure, but for me the stand out voice was John Ratzenberger as Pork Chop the Piggy Bank. Excellent Viewing, Every Time!; This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too. When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides. The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as \"Woody\" and Allen as \"Buzz Armstrong,\" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc. Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed \"winner\" as is the sequel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A treat for fans of family fantasy fun.; As a child, Alan Parrish becomes trapped inside Jumanji, a magical board game he finds discovers buried in a building site. 26 years later, Judy and Peter Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce), two orphaned kids living with their aunt, discover the game in the attic of their new home and begin to play, freeing the now-grown-up Alan (Robin Williams) in the process. Unfortunately, they also release a host of dangerous animals, deadly plants, and an unstoppable bloodthirsty hunter. Their only hope of survival is to finish the game, whatever the risks. Action packed, funny, heartwarming and even a little scary in places, Jumanji is an excellent family adventure for the whole family, and one that, thankfully, doesn't rely solely on its special effects to impress (a good job, since quite a bit of the CGI is looking rather dated). The story is engaging (with a nice time-travel style twist at the end), the cast is great (with Williams managing to give one of his less irritating performances), and once again director Joe Johnston delivers a final product that, whilst not a classic, is still thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb. A walk in the memory lane; We (me and my brother) used to watch a cartoon named \"Jumanzi\" every Wednesday, back in 2000. Watching this movie talk me through a walk in my memory lane. The great Robin Williams also makes me nostalgic. 26 years, struggling and surviving, and than fighting back to get their life back. It is called human spirit. Though, every bit of it is fantasy, the plot become more human, when Robin remembered his saviors, who give him another chance in the game. Really good movie; Jumanji is a really good movie. I read the book and saw the movie and they are both really good. It got a little weird at times but only a few parts. I liked Robin Williams in this movie. The FX is cool. The monkeys don't really look real. You can tell it was computer generated. Over all it was good. It kept you on the edge of you seat. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good adventure movie for kids. Think of it as Night At The Museum meets a board game; Jumanji is based off a cartoon TV series that was made into a film in 1995 and stars funnyman Robin Williams who plays a man called Alan Parrish who as a kid played a board game called Jumanji which was been buried since 1869 with his friend Sarah(Bonnie Hunt)in the year 1969.But when Alan plays the game he gets sucked into it as his friend Sarah watched in horror as each time the player plays the game consequences occur and the only way to finish the game is to play the whole thing. Fast forward 26 years later in 1995 and two young children played by Kirsten Dunst (from the Spider-Man franchise)and Bradley Pierce who's parents died along time ago are now living with their aunt as their aunt bought Alan's old house.But when the two kids stumble across the board game as they hear the drums playing in the background in the attic,its up to them to try and finish off where the player left off and free Alan who helps them finish the game with his friend Sarah. But will they finish the game. Overall this film is really good until the very end which was sorta confusing for me. If you seen it you know what it is but it involves time travelling back to 1969 and then back to 1995 again. But still if you are a fan of Fantasy movies,Robin Williams and if you love something to keep you entertained on a lazy Sunday afternoon Jumanji is worth checking out. Outrageous fun; When young Alan Parish and his childhood friend, Sarah play a board game that Alan found buried near his fathers business, Alan is sucked into the game and left to grow up alone in the jungle. That is until two young children, Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) join the game and release him 26 years later. Every turn in the game becomes a living nightmare that endangers the lives of everyone involved, and the only way to stop it is finish the game. Alan (Robin Williams) and Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) will have to play some more if there lives are return to normality. The concept of the movie is truly original and it successfully delivers on its potential, with an excellent cast and funny script, this adventure is both hilarious and action packed, with some cool special effects thrown in. Great family entertainment 8/10 A lovely little film; This four year-old film, I would highly recommend for anyone out there in fantasy-land. Nice special effects, a very good idea behind the plot and Robin Williams all ensure a thoroughly enjoyable experience if you like action-comedies without the ubiquitous \"Good vs. Bad\" show-down. Jumanji is very different and well worth seeing. I look forward to the upcoming Jumanji 2 next year;  the cast for Jumanji 2 probably needs to include Gerard Depardieu instead of Robin Williams!!!! :-) Jumanji a great classic movie of the mid 1990's; I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was. The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done. This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too. Probably worth checking out, even today; There is a lot to like in this movie. The concept was intriguing. Robin Williams plays a basic Robin Williams character, i.e. a man-child. I never would have recognized Kirsten Dunst or Laura Bell Bradley as children without the cast list, but they both performed well. David Alan Grier did befuddlement just as well back then as he does now. Bebe Neuwirth and Bonnie Hunt did nicely, and looked very nice as well. The pace got a bit frenetic for me, though I understand that this was deliberate. The CGI animals looked fine in the distance but up close, not so much. I know we are spoiled by the unlimited effects in films today, but some of these, like the lion, looked terrible. I saw in the credits that they had Industrial Light &amp; Magic, so I doubt it could have been done any better at the time. And some of the things in the ending did not seem to totally follow from the body of the film. It's probably worth checking out though, even today. Jumanji  a timeless adventure story; There are few children's movies that I particularly enjoyed  I can recount The Borrowers, Labyrinth and The Neverending Story. Jumanji, however takes a new place among children's films  in fact, it may seem that initially, Jumanji is about simplistic story about kids playing a board game. Based on a gorgeous picture book story of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg, this movie takes a beautiful magical adventure and makes it into a thrill ride that defies all natural laws. Time travel, physical transformations, perceptual distortions and multiple universes are just a few of the things that Jumanji toys with. The most evident phenomena is that the characters run in two different and parallel universes, one where Jumanji exists, and the other where it is just a dream. The life of Judy and Peter as orphans exists in a different world from the one where Jumanji doesn't exist  in other words, Jumanji is a catalyst of fate, an evil entity that does not bring about awe as it did in Allsberg's book, but fear. The world that Allen Parrish is doomed to be incarcerated in the jungles of Jumanji is another one, but that period of time is nonexistent in the world he will eventually live in. This is the beauty of the movie; that these characters can only allow their trauma and epiphanies to cross worlds. With each roll of the dice, the characters grow and change. The ending with 'Jumanji' is mark of the end of that universe  everything that the jungle world had yielded, from the colonist-hunter Van Pelt to the roaring stampede and the monkeys had to return, to be sealed into the game and the universe. The game controls life; but it is merciful when played to the end without cheating. The mental agony and pain must have been tremendous for the Parrishes. Presumably, Alan spent his twenty six years in the jungle, but returned to his old self only to again relive his life as if it never happened. The temporal distortion must have presumably had an effect on his parents, although only Sarah seems to notice. (She was playing the game  and only those playing are directly affected, but in the game universe of Judy and Peter we see a problem in the movie's understanding of temporal change) The power of fate in deciding the endgame was critical in the film. It seems that the game was in itself a game of a game; it was all planned out and ready to go. In fact, it also seems that no matter how crazy or perilous the situation is, the characters cannot be killed. Even Van Pelt says at the Sir Sav A Lot that \"I am hunting only Alan. I won't kill you, since you didn't roll\" He too is bound to the rules of the game, no matter how much of a colonialist he is. The game instills a high level of fear without death, in order for the game to continue, all the characters must be present. So in one way, no one need be scared of anything in the game. Instead, the game builds resilience in the characters. It was natural that in the end the end was initiated by the future; or more appropriately the past. At the end, both Sarah and Alan make up for the trouble they have caused and have a life bond from the experience. The jumping between 1994 and 1964 is a critical aspect where we see that the horrors of the game have allowed Judy and Peter's parents to not die in the ski accident. They are oddly willing to put an end to their vacation when they hardly know the Parrishes \"In the jungle, you must wait, until you roll a five or eight\"  Jumanji \"Roll a two, roll a four, but never ask for more\"  Gautam RATING: 10/10 (amazing) An entertaining, chaotic adventure, one which impressed me as a kid and still does now; I first heard of this successful family adventure movie at school in the late primary grades. It must have been new to the VHS format at the time (meaning I missed its successful theatrical run), and a student in my class brought a copy in for show and tell. I think I was interested in seeing it for months before I finally did. I remember watching it more than once on video in the summer of 1996. After those months of anticipation, I don't think I was let down, even if it did seem weird and scary the first time, with all the chaos. I guess I wasn't used to seeing that in films at the time. I've watched it again twice in recent years, after growing up, and both times, I found that it was still entertaining, unlike some movies I enjoyed in my childhood. In 1969, Alan Parrish is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Brantford, New Hampshire, with an upper class family. One day, after being ambushed by a group of bullies, he hears a mysterious sound of drums coming from a construction site! At the site, he digs up a box, where the sound is coming from, a box which was buried there 100 years earlier! Inside, he finds a board game called Jumanji, and takes it home. When Alan is at home by himself after a falling out with his father, his friend, Sarah Whittle, comes over, and he shows her the game. They begin to play it, not realizing how powerful and dangerous it is! Alan is sucked inside, and Sarah is chased off by bats that come out of the game! 26 years later, two kids, Judy and Peter Shepherd, whose parents have died, move into the old Parrish house with their aunt Nora. The siblings hear the drumming of Jumanji from up in the attic, and find the game. They start playing the game without a clue, just like Alan and Sarah did, and dangerous animals begin to come out of it! Also, Alan is finally released after being trapped in the jungle for 26 years! He learns that the year is 1995, and sadly, his parents have passed away. He must now continue the game with Judy and Peter, and reunite with Sarah. The four of them are all players now, and they must finish the game if things are ever going to go back to normal, which will obviously be very risky! The film starts well with the spooky 1869 sequence, when the box is buried out in the dark. After that, it's usually pretty good around the beginning. During the first of my two latest viewings, I remember finding most of the movie dull before Robin Williams comes in, but with my last viewing, I didn't find that to be the case. There isn't much humour during this part of this film, but there is some suspense. When Williams does make his boisterous entry, that's when the humour starts. After that, there's both excitement, with all the action and chaos, and humour. Williams provides laughs with his antics, but the film doesn't rely entirely on him for the humour. Sarah's reluctance to continue the game in 1995, the scene with Van Pelt, the trigger happy hunter from the game in a gun shop, and Aunt Nora and Officer Carl Bentley witnessing some of the Jumanji animals are also funny. Other merits of \"Jumanji\" include some poignant moments, good CGI effects (even if they're not the best, and have been topped since then), and decent acting, which includes decent child actors, unlike some films. All these things are what I think makes this film good family entertainment. HORRIBLE!; This was on TV again recently, and naturally the kids stopped to watch it. Why I will never know. We own a copy and they rarely if ever put it in the VCR. Whose idea was this movie? Joe Johnston, the guy responsible for some of the worst movies of the 1990s and whose only really decent film was HONEY, which was way back when? I have said previously this is really a horror movie in disguise and obviously not a particularly good one. What in hell is with the special effects? Is there a worse-looking set of animals in film history? I wonder all these years later if maybe the distorted, cartoonish look of the monkeys and lion were intentional, since they sprang from a children's board game. But then why do the elephants, rhinos, pelican and even the oversized mosquito, look relatively normal? Robin Williams is about as bad as he ever got, except for the nightmarishly bad JACK (although I never saw his ripoff of Benigni, which I can just imagine to what depths he plummets, and I forgive him WHAT DREAMS MAY COME since he obviously did not write or direct that fiasco). View JUMANJI at your own mental peril! Dangerous Boarding Game; In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called \"Jumanji\" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan's father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. \"Jumanji\" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90's. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Jumanji\" In the Jungle You Must Wait, Until the Dices Add 5 or 8; This film is about two children playing a mysterious board game that was left by the previous owner of the house they're living in now. They play it and the game begins. A man comes out from the game after staying there for a decade. They figure out the game is dangerous and think it would all go away if they just finish it. During the coarse of the game, there is peril everywhere! This is a good movie, not better than Zathura, but it's still good. I have to warn some parents out there because if you're taking your kids to see this movie, it might scare them. Might. Although it didn't scare me because I'm 14. Characters get hurt. Some even die. There are funny moments and sweet moments. This is a good film that anyone could enjoy. Probably not your little children. Quite a Lot of Rapid Movement; I worked for several years at a bookstore. I remember when the children's book \"Jumanji\" came in. The book jacket with the reckless monkeys was very catchy. It was a very short book, so I have a feeling that some liberties were taken with the plot. There had to be a ton of extrapolation. This is a rapid fire movie which at times takes a bit of industry to keep up with. There are rules to the game and for me, they are very hard to follow. There is also a time element that is in play here. Robin Williams, as usual, plays his character to the hilt. The kids are pretty good as well. I'm sure this would appeal to a younger audience. There is no time for attention spans to expire. The computer generated graphics are wonderful, to be sure. Those monkeys are really the stars of the show. Unique; I am trying to find my words in order to perfectly describe Robin, but i just realized that it's impossible to do it. Words are not enough to describe such a man... I've seen a lot of people in my life, all kind of people, but i never saw someone having so much warmth and kindness in just a small smile like Robin. That's something which makes you to love him unconditionally. The way he acted in the movies was so original that it can not be compared with anyone else in the history of cinema. He's smile made us all better people a little bit, which means he changed the world in he's own way. He will be always with us, and within us. Let's make him immortal !!! Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a 10/10. No No No -- its a 10; This is one of those films which sort of faded into obscurity at time of release but will I believe over time be considered a classic. I have seen it over a dozen times. And, for the purposes of this review, the reason I mention that fact is to ask the obvious question... why? And the why is because of the narrative. It is nearly perfect. Heck, it may even be perfect. If you are going to create a hi-CGI fantasy about children, geared to the child within (so to speak) you need to jump down the rabbit-hole is a convincing way, so that there is no hope of return. This is the essence of every good \"fantasy\" from the beginning of time, from Peter Pan to Alice In the Looking Glass to the Matrix. Once you are in, it is hard to get out. And that hooks the audience. What better way to establish such a narrative than a kid's game with \"turns\" and \"dice\"? Where each roll gets you in deeper? Also a great chance to watch to watch Robin Williams and Dunst before he/she became too old to play these roles; and Bonnie Hunt (great!) before her film career imploded. Postscript 12/14 -- with the recent passing of Robin Williams I wanted to add the following, especially after another viewing. First, it is one of the most perfect fantasies Hollywood has done since the invention of color film (keeping in mind that the best fantasies hail from the 30s and 40s). Second, and I know his fans will not agree, possibly Williams' best work. Early in his career, and he got a chance to play a boy in a man's body. Is there a more perfect role for him?? Hunt did not have what you would call a wide or varied film career but she is pitch perfect here, and matches Williams note for note, emotion for emotion. And Kirsten Dunst, another controversial figure, seems to have had a backwards career, with her impact dwindling as she aged. The highlight of her career may have been kissing Spiderman, but her face holds the camera here in every scene she is in, and she too is pitch perfect. Massively un-appreciated, one of the greatest films in its genre ever, right up there with Harry Potter or Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast. This Ain't No Game!; CONTAINS SPOILERS In 1869, two boys bury something unknown but whatever it is, it's very dangerous. It stays for 100 years. In 1969, young Alan Parrish rides his bike one lovely day, unfortunately he's soon chased by Billy Jessup and his gang. Alan goes to his father, Samuel's shoe factory. Alan tells his father what's up, but his father merely tells him that he must stand and face something you're afraid of, so Alan did and got the crap kicked out of him. Suddenly, he heard drums beating. It was in a construction site. He dug up a wooden board game called Jumanji. At home, Alan's parents have announced that they shall send him to Cliffside School for Boys. Alan refuses to go. Samuel get's mad and storms out of the house with his wife. Alan's friend, Sarah Widdle, comes over that night and the two decide to play the game Alan found. It resulted in Alan being sucked into the game until someone would roll a 5 or 8. 26 years later-1995. A woman named Nora, her niece Judy and nephew Peter buy the old Parrish house. One aternoon, while Aunt Nora left for the office and the kids were about to leave for school when they hear drums beating. The game was calling. They dig it out of the attic and decide to play it. Out of the game comes monkeys, mosquitos and a lion! Also, Alan comes out. He's very grateful, then goes to the old shoe factory to find his parents. He learns of their passing; by finishing the game, they can put an end to the wild animal attacks, so the three go off to find Sarah Widdle, because according to the game, it was her turn. At first she was reluctant to play, but she did. They encounter a huge pod plant and a hunter, Van Pelt who wants to kill Alan for some reason. Well, after braving a stampede, a huge rain fall, giant spiders and an earthquake, the game was over and all went back to 1969 where Alan patched things up with his father, he and Sarah get rid of the game and live happily ever after in the bright and cheerful 1995, rather than the dark one Jumanji had created. Pretty good movie! Nice special effects. Robin Williams was good, as always. Bonnie Hunt was good. The kids were too. Kirsten Dunst grew up to play Spiderman's love interest. Also, the same actor that plaus Samuel Parrish (Jonathan Hyde of Richie Rich) also plays Van Pelt. I hear there's going to be a sequel: Jumanji 2. But it doesn't have Robin Williams. For the life of me, I can't figure out what it will be like. But for now, you gotta see the first one! -- It's time to play the game. You can't move until somebody roll 5 or 8.; Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. \"Jumanji\" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game. The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078; Despite the fact that I am a huge Robin Williams fan, I had never seen Jumanji, it just never appealed to me, but even since Williams' untimely passing, I've been trying to view his entire filmography. I also wanted to catch the original film, before its reputation was irreparably damaged by next years re-make, featuring the Rock, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart. The film focuses on young Alan Parrish (Robin Williams), the son of a rich industrialist, who is always in the way. One day, he finds a weird board game, buried in a construction site, and decides to play with a friend, but this is no ordinary game, and Alan becomes trapped inside for decades. It isn't until two kids, moving into a new house discover the game and start to play it, that Alan is freed. Not wanting these kids, to face the same fate he did, they track down his old friend, and decide to finish the game and put the madness to an end. I think when Robin Williams played a child or a crazy person he was at his best. Those were the time when he could really just let go, be free, and be truly hilarious. As in most films like this, Williams is the film, the rest of the cast revolves around him, and without him, this is just another kids movie. Kids love these quirky, weird films, and parents hate being dragged to them, but Williams had a way of making both sides happy and making them both want to see it, that's what Jumanji was. For all intense and purposes this is a kids movie, with Williams acting like a big kid, but making adult jokes, innuendoes, and just being that guy who made him a legend. Almost Thoroughly Enjoyable; If I had been 10 or 12 when this movie came out it would probably be my favorite.  As I was 34, my first reaction was that there was too much screaming. But there's much here for an imaginative youngster (or oldster) to enjoy.  The script is generally witty, and except for the screaming, parents will not be bored watching it -- and if they squint their minds eyes enough to remember what they enjoyed before puberty, they'll get a nostalgic rush. This is everything family entertainment should be.  And though it does involve the supernatural, it is presented in a negative light and none of the characters relish being part of it. I guess that life is a game of chance!; You know the drill: young Alan Parrish gets sucked into a board game called Jumanji, returns when a brother and sister are playing 26 years later, and has to battle the animals that wreak havoc on the town. It all seems pretty simple, but they play some neat tricks with it in the movie. As the adult Alan, Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but still makes the character admirable. With good support from Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and Patricia Clarkson, this is a pretty interesting movie. I will admit that the monkeys looked pretty fake, but we can't dwell on that in this movie; the point is to enjoy oneself while watching it. Oh and one more thing: from \"Jumanji\", I learned the difference between alligators and crocodiles. If I could go back...; I love this movie. I don't know why. Maybe because I wonder what it would be like to start my life over again when I was 10 or 12, knowing what I know now at...well, much older. My favorite part is at the end, when Alan and Sarah come face to face in 1995 with the 2 kids who played the game with them the PREVIOUS 1995. Visually very interesting and not a rip off of any other film, that's for sure! Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Exciting Family Adventure; In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called \"Jumanji\", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished. Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human. The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like \"Dead Poet's Society\" or \"Good Morning, Vietnam\"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality. This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor. Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the \"Narnia\" stories). Fortunately, any moralising in \"Jumanji\" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of \"alternative timelines\". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10 Meaningful themes for all ages; This film is NOT a 'kids' film and it is NOT just another example of Hollywood making money off of an already existing product. Let me tell you what it is. It's a film that examines such pertinent themes as frustrated adolescence, negligent adults and wishes that do and don't come true. The cast is superb. The script provides them with enough action so that they can just do what they do best (ie comedy) without being 'preachy' with the messages that the writer was trying to convey. I was anxiously awaiting the sequel because I figured that, as movie technology advances, some of the flatness of the special effects would be fixed. Oh well. David Alan Grier was especially funny. He is one of Hollywood's best kept secrets. He belongs in movies not just T.V.. Decent family entertainment; On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children. Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it. Lame, lamer, lamest.; I guess this must be meant to appeal to kids, because has that R.L. Stein flavor to it -- you can't suspend disbelief because the whole thing is just so cheesy and lame. The closet thing to an interesting character is Carl the cop -- although Sara seeing a shrink after watching Alan vanish IS a hoot. Fine for the kids, but adults would do better with a book and a hot bath. Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... The jungle; This is an excellent movie for all ages. Congratulations to the cast, production, stunts and all the people. And now I want know what's happen in the jungle when Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) was there for 26 years. This should be a good adventure. This game is like no other.; Roll doubles and look out.  Elaborate special effects highlight this tale about two kids who release an imprisoned player trapped for decades in a supernatural board game. Story line is quite stupid, but this is so much fun to watch. Robin Williams does his thing. A young Kirsten Dunst is charming in this preview of her future talents. Rounding out this mish-mash of a cast are: Bebe Neuwirth, David Alan Grier, Bradley Pierce, Bonnie Hunt and Jonathan Hyde in a dual role. Special effects and sight gags are redeeming. The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for 25(?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\" Probably not perfect, but very fun; Jumanji is a highly imaginative and very fun movie. The visuals are good, and the story is creative and exciting. The storyline consists of a man being sucked into a board game. 26 years later, two kids find the board game and set him free. However, the game board has already released a few dangers, and those dangers must be stopped. The only way to do that is to finish the board game, and the animals (or whatever else was released from the game) will be put back into the game. There is action and minor thrills, and the movie emerges as being a fun experience. It's kind of creative, and it's an excellent adventure film. Sure, it is a bit cliché'd and the monkeys look pretty corny, but don't let them distract you from the overall enjoyment of the movie. 6.5/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment. original, not like any other game; I saw this when I was 9, and I was obsessed with it and saw it 3 times in the theater, and it was my favorite movie. The whole idea of slight, unhappy, 12-year-old Alan Parrsih (Adam Hann-Byrd-Little man Tate, Halloween H:20) getting trapped in a board game in 1969, for 26-years and coming back as a grown man. The idea was unforgettable to my interest in time, and I imagined my self then coming back 35-years old. The movie is so elaborate and original, the stampede was always my favorite, it's got such edge-of-year seat action with the Rhinos, Elephants, and Zebras crashing throught the wall at the last second, and they used the most dangerous animals possible. Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) ALan's childhood friend, and Peter (Bradley Pierce) and Judy (Kirsten Dunst, along with Alan play the game and bring Gian mosquitos, vines and a Hunter from the game. The movies also really funny especially the cop. Geeky Randy's summary; Fun family film about a magical board game that hosts many dangers that can only be stopped when a player finishes. The entire cast does their job well, but the only one not interchangeable is Hyde in a double-role as the main character's wealthy stern father and a big-game hunter (hint: intentional parallel). Entertaining from start to finish, but even children in 1995 were likely very aware that the scary creatures on screen were nothing more than special-effectsbecause of this, it's difficult to ever get lost in the delicious chaos despite all the funny moments and thrills. Still, despite its flaws, the story is interesting enough for the whole family enjoy and the film is good enough to be replayed every few years. *** (out of four) A game for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind; A fun family film about a game. I was sceptical, but as I like Robin Williams, I was obliged to go and see the film. The first thing that hit was the atmosphere. It's a bizarre and quite scary film. Well for a 7 year old anyway. Robin Williams plays the part really well but the real star of the film is the special effects. The stampede and various other disasters from the game were fantastic for their day. OK they look a bit dated now but in their time, they were some of the most advanced special effects ever used in movies. Bonnie Hunt steals the show with her humour and character. And the 2 children are fantastic as actors. The only thing that lets Jumanji down is the tag line. It gives away too much of the story of the film. But don't let that spoil things. The film is an unmissable adventure based on a small picture book. Surprised? You will be. IT's the most great movie EVER, you can't get Enough of it; I want to give this movie what it really deserve ,If i will say there is movie that i will never forget in my life ,it will be this great movie for the brilliant actor robin Williams. first of all, I want to thanks all the cast of this movie and the great director ,for bringing it to us. when I want to be refresh and happy and laugh I will watch it when I want to feel the power of love and the thriller of adventure, I will watch it , there are a lot of people how see it as for children only but its really not , it was like they know where to start and finish. this movie is for everyone its my best movie ever I give it 10%10 don't miss it Not board; Watched this on TV where it was aired as a tribute to the late Robin Williams. It's an enjoyable family-entertainment fantasy adventure with Williams playing a grown man who as a boy was sucked into a mysterious, dark board game called Jumanji, freed years later by a couple of young children who happen upon the game when they move into Williams's character by this time run-down house. Along with Williams also fully-grown girl friend of the time Kirsten Dunst, the four of them brave everything the game throws at them to finish it and free Williams to return to his old life. And does the game throw everything at them! Crazy monkeys, a roaring lion, a jungle which comes to life, hordes of stampeding elephants zebras and rhinos and one very persistent big game hunter. A veritable special effects fest, while the plot amounts to no more than awaiting the outcome of the next roll of the dice on the board, it all makes for good clean exciting fun and who amongst us as never enjoyed playing a board game as a child. The back stories about Williams being bullied as a child, having a fractious relationship with his dad and his adult wooing of Dunst are lightly drawn but all of course resolved happily ever after by the end. Williams is fine after he makes his delayed first appearance, portraying yet again a child trapped in a man's body just as he did in a line going back through Peter Pan in \"Hook\", \"Popeye\" all the way to his breakout part in \"Mork and Mindy\". Dunst offers good support and the kids aren't too gauche and sentimental either. Nice to see \"Cheers\" Bebe Neuwirth get a decent part too. I wouldn't call it Robin Williams defining role but as an update on the old children's matinée features, this was an entertaining feature made the better by Williams engaging performance. R.I.P. to him. When two kids from the 60's stumble upon a game, one of them is sucked into its jungle.  Now it's up to two present day kids to finish it.; ********/10 This movie deserves more than it received because it is not only a very different plot but has excellent character development, which is key to a great movie. The special effects are so-so (due to the time period in which it was made), but it is overall exciting while humorous. There isn't a movie quite like this one, and is one of my favorites. Robbin Williams is tremendous and while watching it you forget his true identity. Kerstien Dunst is young, but is impressive for her age, commonly not found in some movies. I guess if I'd have to sum this movie up in one word it'd be \"unique\". Not many films have monsoons indoors or mansions turned into jungles. The Disney movie that could have been; Hunt and Williams play the parts of shellshocked-delayed stress syndrome surviviors quite well. The story is entertaining and engrossing, with both elements of light and darkness. The effects-well, they DO look a bit unreal-and perhaps that is for the best-it adds a sense of unreality to the story -after all, these things come from a board-game universe! Even Van Pelt looks a bit CGI...and Bebe Nuewerth is a sweetie. Not for 13+ age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for 1980 not for 1995. Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. Watts meets New England; Disaster visits a New England town: When all hell breaks loose, when beasts from nowhere trample the streets and earthquakes rip the blocks and giant mosquitoes and God-knows-what-next befall the descendants of pilgrims and fishermen, of Minutemen and revolutionaries and of immigrants yearning to breath free, those same hard-scrabble, salt-of-the-earth, no-nonsense patriots all join hands, pull together, and-- . . . loot their neighbors' downtown storefronts! Unbelievable.  Tinseltown belts out a fairly well-done and imaginative fantasy (which truly `Jumanji' is), and then--wouldn't you know it?--foul it with one of the many flies stuck in the ointment that is Hollywood, a scene so diagnostic of the intellectual sickness that has infested the industry since Hellman sang her praises to Stalin.  Then again, maybe it is believable. `Jumanji's' only other flaws: a part too small for the underrated Bebe Neuwirth (a joy to watch always and here no less so), kids full of bravery that's a little too scripted and moments of suspense that really aren't. If we can ignore all that, even the brief bit of class-warfare propaganda, then \"Jumanji' becomes eminently watchable, even memorable. But promise us you won't loot any stores next time you see monkeys charging down the street. Grade A Effects; This movie is the kind of movie you wouldn't want to watch when you're trying to get to sleep. This movie is lurking with action and adventure around every corner, along with some animals. Great effects, good plot, and interesting characters. A *** out of ****. Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. Good, classic, family fun; Despite being rejected by many a film critic for being childish and lacking in the classic sweepstakes, I found this film more than enough to satisfy my evening desires. With its strong plot and good actors, this film has much going for it, despite slightly lame CGI, its the story that carries you on. I have heard few people praise this film but I believe it to be a classic due to having an eerie dark sense all the way through until the credits roll, whilst still maintaining comedy and being for the whole family. It is bound to keep the viewer thinking of the awful situation these people face long after viewing has finished. Overall, one of the high points of Williams' career, and Kursten Dunst has never been better. Try it, you might surprise yourself.  Excellent!; There is only one way to describe Jumanji: excellent. The plot is very, original, with outstanding concepts packed into each individual scene. After viewing this movie, the wild side of the jungle gets into you, making you want to dare to play the game. Although the computer animation may not look all that real, I still give this movie a 10/10, for an outstanding plot, casting, and spirit, which any great movie has. Almost 20 years on and it's still entertaining kids of all ages; Jumanji was on TV today, and my 8 year old son had liked him in \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and I remembered it being fun, so with sweets and crisps we sat down to watch it. Orphans Judy (A young Kristen Dunst, who had started in \"An Interview With A Vampire\" the previous year, but still a few years away from Spiderman fame) and Peter move in to a mansion with their Aunt (Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers) where the find a board game called Jumanji. When they start playing, they free Alan Parish (Robin Williams) who was trapped in the game when he was a child. Robin Williams is always fun to watch and he was very popular at the time, due to movies like \"Aladdin\" and \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and Kristen Dunst was a real talent as a young actress, none of the annoying traits of usual child actors. Of the supporting cast David Alan Grier is fun as a hapless Police Officer, as is Jonathan Hyde in duel roles as a hunter and young Alan's Dad. Defo worth checking out if you have kids, and more than enjoyable even if you don't. Some of the special effects have dated badly, but are still OK, most of the humour is spot on too. My son got a big kick out if it and really enjoyed it. And I thought for a 19 year old special effects laden kids movie it had held up pretty well. I love this film!; I loved this movie! First of all, my #1 favorite actress is Kirsten Dunst, who plays Judy! I have seen Kirsten in countless other films including: Bring It On, Disney's Anastasia, Mona Lisa Smile, Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2 (June 30), and (Duh!) Jumanji of course. We have a lot in common. I am a HUGE fan of Robin Williams as well. He has played in films that I've seen such as: Mrs. Doubtfire, (also starring Pierce Brosnan who plays the worlds greatest Secret Agent: Bond, James, Bond. Robin has also been in: Disney's Aladdin (The Genie), Patch Adams, Flubber, Biscentanial Man, and Hook. I have seen Bonnie Hunt in her t.v. show, Life With Bonnie, and Cheaper By The Dozen starring the ever sooooo funny comedian Steve Martin and my sister's favorite actress Hilary Duff. I have a lot of favorite actor's but only one actress, and that's Kirsten! When I first saw her in Jumanji I fell in love with her. She is one beautiful young lady. I didn't know who she was though, LOL!!! I didn't recognize her in Spider-Man \"sigh\". As I looked at the credit's I saw a name: Kirsten Dunst. I remember seeing that name in the end credit's for Jumanji. I just about fainted, LOL!!!! I rented Jumanji again, and I looked at her and I realized: \"Wow, she hasn't changed a bit!\" \"She's still got those big Blue eye's that I just love,\" she hasn't lost her sense of humor,\" and I will always, always, ALWAY'S LOVE HER SMILE! Every movie I've seen her in, she's always been a really hot Redhead, Well, in Jumanji she wasn't a redhead, but, SHE WAS STILL HOT! LOL!!!! She's a legend, to me. I looked at her biography on IMDb.com and I saw that she was born on April 30,1982! I just about fell out of my chair. LOL!!! I was born April 10,1988!!!!!! She's six years older than me, but heck! I still love her. But, I'll always remember her as that little girl named Judy in Jumanji! My favorite line that she said was when the Cop commented on Robin's clothes for the first time: \"He's a Vegetarian! I was sucking in air, I was laughing so hard. Another scene was in the rain in Jumanji when Robin and Bonnie were about to kiss, and Kirsten is in the back rolling her eyes! LOL!!! That brought be back to the upside down kiss in the rain in Spider-Man! Jumanji is a fun movie! It can be a little intense sometimes, but it can also be funny. One last thing: KIRSTEN DUNST IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE MY FAVORITE ACTRESS! THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE! Til the dice read five or eight ",
       " Jumanji; Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in 1995, I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 1800's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in 1969, transporting him into the jungle world for 26 years until two new children stumble upon its drumming. Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time ",
       " well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects. The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be \"real\", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end. The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still childrenone had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow upand with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think. There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as \"Soulman\" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the \"adult\" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal. A great movie; JUMANJI I loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today! The movie is about a boy who finds a board game called Jumanji. When he takes it home and starts to play it with a friend, he soon realises that this is no ordinary game. He gets sucked into the game and is not released again until 26 years later 2 more kids find the game and release him. Now he is grown up and has to find a way to end this game before everything it releases destroys the town. Due to the sad passing of the genius that was Robin Williams, the TV channels have decided to show all of his movies. Jumanji was the first one I saw. The story to this film is like not her that I had seen before. It was an original idea (unless there is another film I don't know about) that was just so imaginative. It works really well and has a great adventure element about it. The effects are average. This was made in the mid 90s so that probably has something to do with it. The animals were obviously not real. You could see the lion was so mechanical it made me laugh. And the other animals were so obviously computer generated. But it was comical and that just added to the fun of the film. The acting was great. The main character was played by Robin Williams. He was as energetic and full of character in this role, just like he brought to every role he took. Other cast members were Jonathan Hyde, a young Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bonnie Hunt. Bonnie Hunt was brilliant. Her reaction and facial expressions made me laugh a few times in this. Another stand out performance was by David Alan Grier. David was so funny as the cop. His comedy timing was excellent and deserves a mention. This film really does keep you entertained throughout and is just a lot of fun to watch... Even now nearly 20 years later. I will give this 7 out of 10. Normally I end my reviews with a quote from the movie, but this time I just want to say how gutted I am about the news of Robins death. I am a fan of his work. I watched Mork and Mindy when I was a kid and grew up watching Jumanji, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam, Jack etc... There were so many great films that he made. I always saw Robin as so full of energy and full of life. He had one of the greatest smiles in Hollywood and when i saw an interview with him, he seemed so chirpy and happy. It just shows that in front of the camera, you never know what is going on in people's heads. I was sad to hear he had been suffering from depression. Depression is such a deadly illness. I know this sounds stupid, but I am gutted that I was not there to talk to him, help him. I hate to think that he felt so alone, especially as he had millions of fans all over the world that knew him on screen. He made the world laugh out loud so many times. Even through bad times in my life, watching his movies has put a smile on my face. Robin deserved much more happiness than he got. He gave so much to me and the rest of the world and it doesn't seem right that he should end his life this way. I will miss seeing new movies from him, but will always continue to go back to enjoy his old ones. Robin will live on in my house and he will always continue to make me smile. R.I.P. Robin Williams. A 90s classic.; Jumanji has some decent acting from the adults and from the kids. Apparently this film is set in New Hampshire - the scenery is not all that, maybe because New Hampshire itself is not all that, but regardless this is a fun fast-paced adventure flick that is never boring. An error in this film is that this board game is depicted as some sort of master of the universe, the majority of the film is set in 1995 - When Alan is out of the game and everything else from the game gets sucked back in the film goes back to 1969 where Alan and Sarah are kids again, fast forward to the 90s and they meet Judy, Peter and their parents, i guess the movie wanted to make it an extremely happy ending where the parents get a second chance, but then at the same time Judy and Peter never remember Alan and Sarah, this is the definition of a fantasy movie, if you think about the logic of it too much it'll drive you crazy. Bottom line if this error never happened there'd be no movie, this is what a fantasy movie is - a motion picture that is completely out there and difficult to wrap your head around. A lot of the scenes are still embarrassingly funny - a few examples - when the monkeys shoot the roof of the car and drive off, some of the behavior and dialogue from the police officer Carl Bentley, when Alan and Sarah get stuck in the floor, and the result of Bentley's literal wreck of a car is embarrassingly cringe-worthy in itself. Jumanji actually has a realistic element which is the behavior of Alan's father, he doesn't seem to care that much about Alan, is self- absorbed expecting Alan to follow his footsteps with boarding school, and is generally quite strict and cold and just like Alan said during one scene - his father could barely even hug him. After Alan went missing the father got depressed, stopped going to work and that was the end of it, he only seemed to care about Alan when Alan wasn't there, what's the point of that?! it's like emotional displacement or something, it was all a little too late, but as we see at the end Alan's parents are still alive and it's clear that they have time to change their standoffish relationship. This is the definition of a children's movie - everything has to be happy with no tragedies at the end. Jumanji is very dramatic but brilliant especially the \"Iv'e seen things you've only seen in your nightmares\" scene and the \"26 years ago you played a game with a little boy down the street\" scene - those two pieces of dialogue were done fantastically by Robin Williams and his facial expression and body language worked perfectly with the dialogue. This motion picture also shows the viewers how children think, the scene where Alan mentions that he \"remembers the front porch being a lot bigger\" tells us that kids see everything bigger than they actually are. The funky new-age woman \"Sarah\" - the adult version is also a likable character even though she sometimes talks crap with her star- sign/zodiac-sign garbage. There is no chemistry between her and Alan though, but they can get away with it because that is not what this film is about. The special effects are what they are, they're not as bad as to ruin the movie. The actor who plays Alan's dad also plays the human hunter, why they used the same actor i don't know, but regardless he did a good job in both roles. Jumanji is set in a small town and if you are starting to dislike small town settings as i am then you can choose not to focus on the town and focus more on the main plot. Thankfully this flick only has literally a few main characters and it does a great job of making sure the plot outweighs anything else. Ja Rule Jumanji; 'Jumanji' is a drama comedy about a boy who is always picked on by a bunch of bullies. He gets sucked into a disastrous game board called 'Jumanji'. He was taken to a jungle for 26 long years. He then comes back after the dice read 8 and with the 3 other players who unleash the unexpected dangers of the jungle",
       " onto the real world. Alan Parish is a troubled boy with kids picking on him 24/7. One day while walking through a construction site he finds a chest that holds 'Jumanji' - the board inside it. He starts playing this game with a young girl, Sarah, where he is sucked into the game. After 26 yrs he comes back as a man!! Sarah Whittle is one of the bully's girlfriends and she brought back Alan's bike when he invited her in to play the game. She was really scared when Alan was sucked into the game, after that she was chased by bats all the way down the street. It looks so real but when she falls over and a bat is on her shoulder, it looks Judy and Peter are the two other players who live with their generous aunt because their parents had died in a car crash. Judy lies because it makes her feel better and Peter doesn't talk to any one except Judy. Peter turns into a half monkey/human for cheating, which special effects make this look real. Together all four encounter many different but dangerous stuff from the jungle. Not only does it affect Alan, Sarah, Judy and Peter, it affects the whole town. All in all 'Jumanji' is a rollicking imaginative adventure that will carry you away",
       " literally!! My Childhood; This movie made my childhood. I love Robin Williams movies, Jumanji introduced him to me. Jumanji is a movie that everyone should watch. Robin Williams will again make you appreciate living as he always does in his movies. The movie contains full of fantasy objects. The writer has a really great imagination. I will make my children to watch this movie after all years that pass. While watching this movie as a kid, I was scared, excited and happy. It makes you to feel every kind of feeling. This indicates that the movie has done a good job. I again recommend to everyone. Jumanji appeals for all ages. I am pretty sure I will watch the movie again when I get old with the same emotions when I watched it in the first time. Jumanji Review; Jumanji is a film directed by Joe Johnston based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg. Now I wasn't quite excited to see the films considering the reviews. But I did enjoy Zathura, the spiritual sequel to this film so I deiced to give it a go. And to my surprise I was quite entertained by the film. Plot: Judy and Peter play a board game to some disastrous results. Story and direction: The film opens up with 2 children from 1869 burying something and saying that whoever opens this up may God be with them. I mean this scene was basically not necessary. The film could have opened from 1969 with our protagonist Alan Parrish. We see Alan's world where he is bullied a lot and hides in his father's shoe factory. There we are introduced to Carl who I think was not necessary for the film in the first place. Then we see Alan taking the Jumanji game to his home and opening it. in the meanwhile, we see Alan's parents deciding to send him to boarding school to which he objects and decides never to talk to them again. Then Alan and Sarah begin to play the game when Alan gets sucked into it and Sarah getting scared runs for her life. Then the film takes a 26 year leap, where we are introduced to 2 new characters Peter and Judy, who have been given a quite nice back story. They open up the game and while they playing Alan comes out of it. Then we are taken on a joyride where the try to finish the game with a now grown Sarah. Now the thing that felt awful in the film was the CGI. It felt like you were watching some big patches of imagery that were just pasted onto the screen. Then I guess the Van Pelt character. He was just too laughable for me. And was wasted a lot. And finally, the revised 1995 version wherein some things were not explained rightly, according to me. Performances: Robin Williams made me remember that why I will be remembering him as a great actor. His comic timing was spot on. RIP Sir Williams. Bonnie Hunt was also great as Sarah. Kirsten Dunst was a great child artist in the film. So as Bradley Pierce. Favirite Scene: The scene where Alan pops up to save Peter and Judy from a lion and his joy that he has returned home after 26 years of being trapped in the game. Robin Williams just acted so great in this scene. Verdict: Although with some misses, Jumanji is a very much watchable film. I enjoyed my time with this movie. I am going with a 7.5/10 Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is 1969, and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats. 26 years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good! QFC - Jumanji; Jumanji is a fun filled film with great special effects, gripping action and it revolves around an interesting although absurd idea of a damned board game. However absurd this idea may be, it works as far as the adventure goes. It has many flaws because eventually the absurdity becomes too much and, especially for adults, it will become annoying because of its repetition in the the attempt of filling the movie with 'funnys'. Robin Williams himself is a pleasant surprise as the action hero. His choice may have been a little surprising, but alas, Williams shows he is able to be anything, anytime, anywhere. So hats off to his performance, not the deepest ever but an enjoyable turn for him. Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. My first childhood film and one of my all time favorites!; I was born in 1994 so I am one year older than but my Uncle bought a copy of Jumanji when I was in pre-school and the whole family watched it together. And after seeing the film for the first time, the story is just like a funny adventure to me and I really love it. I always sneak up to the CD cabinet to watch it again because my grandmother always gone mad every time I switch the CD player and the television. And after a several replays, the movie grown deeper to me; the message of the film and everything. Until now, I still watch the movie and still having lots of laugh. Early CGI Makes the Monkeys Look Fake! Otherwise It's Amazing!; An enchanted board game breaks into the real world and the only way out of it is to finish the game! The monkeys look \"washed-out\" and so do some of the wild zoo animals; which is why most of the rest of the EFX are mechanical or use backdrops and mattes. Otherwise a very strong 10 would be my vote, as the casting works and the plot shows lots of imagination and flair. With a \"sly wink\" to \"Peter Pan\", Alan's father plays both his dad and Van Pelt the Hunter. My two favorite scenes are when the house gets folded in half and eaten by the monstrous plant, and when everything swirls backwards into the gameboard. I also love it when the house goes \"wild\" and turns into a swamp complete with nasty alligators. I do not like the scene where the little boy turns into a monkey with a tail. Young children may find it disturbing like the donkey transformation in \"Pinocchio\". \"Jumanji\" is suspenseful and scary but no one actually dies in the film. Therefore, it's much more enjoyable when viewed again. The only one who seemed to hate it was Roger Ebert, but it's only too scary for pre-schoolers. Most \"users\" love it! What \"scares\" me the most in this film: the bats, insects, spiders, alligators, and The Hunter. The sequel will not have the charisma of the late and great Robin Williams. I still miss him. He was a comic genius. If there was a market for it, I would like it to be re-imagined with better graphics like the old \"Star Trek TOS\" reissue. A breathless unforgettable adventure!; I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind... This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure. Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story. Great! 10 out of 10 from me! Game Over, Man; Spoilers herein. The reason this film was made was because they could do the effects. That reason has no power now, and in fact most of them already look a bit cheezy. But there are some interesting elements: --Kirstin Dunst at her peak. --Robin Williams in his best role. Or rather for the role best suited to a manic comic. --A pretty cool house, one of the best in recent memory. --Some clever time folding. --A screenwriter's wet dream: in addition to creating a film world that sucks in viewer into an artificial reality, to have that film world contain another one. That world-within-the world is exactly as far from the normal world of the film as it is from us. Just like the film, it grabs us once we start and won't let go until the end. Clever idea. Not exploited. Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements. Jumanji: One of My Personal Favourites. Period.; I was about one years old when this came out, by three I was mesmerised by the analog and digital effects Jumanji contained. It stood aside the efforts of Jurassic Park, but more animal-based as Jurassic Park was dinosaurs. Robin Williams pulls off a strong performance as Alan Parrish. The film revolved his character playing the game and escaping the world the game brought to him. It had Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce aside Williams whom join this adventure. I believe the film took a creative angle, which more fluctuation that the book left for the imagination. Here it follows the book accurately, just with expansion amongst the book's basis. Hence allowed more adventure and opened more for the viewer digging themselves within this jungle adventure. I can go on about the film's details and how they amaze me. But I conclude Jumanji: One of My Personal Favourites. Period. wild CGI destruction gets repetitive; In 1869, two boys bury a mysterious dangerous wooden chest. In 1969 Brantford, New Hampshire, young Alan Parrish gets picked on by bullies. He finds the box in a local construction site. He opens the chest to find a board game Jumanji. His father is sending him to boarding school. He is about to run away when his best friend Sarah Whittle comes by. They play the game and Alan is pulled into the board game. Twenty six years later, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) buys the rundown mansion planning to open a bed-and-breakfast. She brings her niece Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter (Bradley Pierce) who lost their parents in a car accident. The kids find the board game in the attic and start playing it. Alan (Robin Williams) is released. They track down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) to finish the game and bring all the released apparitions to an end. Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) was a friend who worked at Alan's shoe factory and is now a cop. The game brings out big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) who looks like Alan's father Sam. The basic idea of a board game that comes alive is one with great possibilities. I wish that it is more than just a series of crazy CGI destruction. I wish that the players needed to use their brain power to solve clues. The constant escaping from one thing to the next gets a little bit repetitive. They start piling on top of one another. Williams is not quite as lovable as expected. Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier are kind of fun. There is an uncontrolled quality to this children's movie. Imaginative (spoiler); This is probably one of the most imaginative movies I have seen in a while. I mean, it has an entire back story, as we can see in the beginning, when those two kids are trying to get rid of the game. Then it goes to 1969, when Alan finds the game, he and Sarah start playing, and he gets sucked into Jumanji. Then, throughout the rest of the movie, Alan comes out of the jungle and he, Sarah, Judy, and Peter continue playing the game and unleashing all these dangerous animals (and Van Pelt) and the monsoon and killer plants into the city. And at the end, those kids in Japan find the game. Very well thought out. Certainly worth a look. pretty good, except...; Jumanji is an enjoyable, and at times exciting family adventure. Only one major flaw: the special effects. Jumanji relies on special effects for impact. Nothing wrong with that, only its so easy to tell that they are special effects. Enough fun to get you to sit through it, but they should really find another effects crew next time. 2/4 Fun!; I give this movie a ten on ten. I may be biased as I watched this movie when I was ten and whenever I watch it, it brings back fond memories of lazing around and watching movies during my summer vacations. But I am surprised that the overall rating for this movie is 6.5 (when I write this review), I expected it to be at least 7. This really is a fun movie to watch with some hilarious scenes. The monkey bike riding scene stands out it particular. The special effects looked good when I was young but now the fake animals are not very impressive. Jurassic Park was made before this movie and had much better special effects. Robin Williams does seem too old to play a 35 year old Alan Parish but he is a brilliant actor and you do not mind accepting him as Alan. Bonnie Hunt does a good job too as the paranoid Sarah Whittle. The kids do a great job too, especially Bradley Pierce; look out for the scene where he is searching for an axe. And David Grier is brilliant as the bumbling sheriff Carl Bentley. I suggest you watch this movie with your family on a weekend. Its worth it! Epitome of Moronic Hollywood Film-Making; A previous reviewer wrote: \"A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie.\" I agree in part and disagree in part with that comment. The problem is impossible to pinpoint, because there are PLENTY of \"big problems\" with this movie! \"Random hazard generator\" is the PERFECT description of the ancient board game! Random hazard after random hazard until the game ends is what is supposed to pass for \"plot\" in this movie. Did anybody count how many times the game board fell out of and back into the players' hands? That, too is supposed to pass for tension. Ultimately, the film fails because there isn't any development of the back story. What was the origin of the game? Now, that would have been an interesting question to explore! And how does the game work? All we ever see is the game's projection of \"random hazards\" OUTWARD into the reality of the players, but somehow Alan (Robin Williams) apparently was sucked INTO the game. How did that happen, and why doesn't it happen to any of the current players of the game? Actually, the guy in the pith helmet is, more or less, the human villain in this movie, but he is never more than an inexplicable, evil cartoon. Was he, too sucked into the game like Alan, or is he the sole human \"random hazard\" generated by the game? Why is he so determined, not to hunt animals, but to MURDER Alan? The film just glosses over the fact that this sub-plot is actually one of premeditated murder! The hunter guns for Alan simply because the plot demands it. But the movie makes no attempt whatever to explain the character. Never once did I sense any genuine emotional chemistry among the characters. Just a bunch of actors acting - not INTERACTING. The love story sub-plot felt obligatory, never genuine. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt never generated enough chemistry to make me care whether Alan and Sarah got together in the predictable end. All in all, this film has the germ of an interesting idea that is really wasted by focusing on mindless, non-stop \"random hazards,\" poor CGI effects, \"lots of screaming and running around\" and insufficient character development. Except for the precise nature of each \"random hazard,\" the whole film was disappointingly predictable, including the cliché of the almost-kiss in the midst of peril routine. How many zillion times has that been used? The dialog is a similarly endless stream of clichés. The issue was never HOW the game would end - but WHEN. The more interesting issues were never even glanced at. This kind of movie can only appeal to people raised on video games. It was generated by that kind of adventure-for-the-sake-of-adventure mentality, and it has that same kind of feel. LOVE THIS MOVIE!; Last night, May 2,2003  this movie was on again........no matter what other show we might be browsing at the time, we invariably start watching Jumanji,,,,,,we enjoy the hilarity and antics of all the characters,  it's done for shear  fun and entertainment, and we don't care if the special effects may be outdated,  we still consider it one of the best! So there! :-) Two  Happy Fishes  from oHIo Fine special effects, fizzled screenplay; This is another of those films where a 30-minute documentary on how they did the special effects would be a lot more interesting (not to mention a lot shorter) than the movie itself. The digital effects and animatronics are great; the screenplay doesn't work. A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie. The pasted-on homilies the screenplay comes up with _ the need for courage, commitment, real parent-child communication _ are drowned out in the hubbub, and a good cast (not to mention a big budget) is wasted. And they're planning a sequel to THIS? Have they run out of good (or even mediocre) films to do sequels to? Game You Could Only Dream About; Alan Parrish is the son of wealthy shoe maker Samuel Parrish. But the life of a rich man's son changes when young Alan comes upon a new board game, he is transported into it while playing it. Twenty or so years later two orphaned children, Judy (Kristen Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) come upon the game and play it. Next thing they now, Alan pops out of the game twenty years older along with a lion and some monkeys. It is a race to win the game with Alan (Robin Williams), Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt), Judy, and Peter while trying to outrun stampedes and Van Pelt, the man hunter. The movie has what a movie should have. The interaction of some of then animals is sometimes scary, sometimes funny, and sometimes just strange. Robin Williams is good like always and supported by Dunst, Hunt, and Jonathan Hyde (Van Pelt). It's what some mite call a child thriller. What to classify it as is though but it was good. Jumanji. Starring: Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kristen Dunst, Bradley Pierce, and Jonathan Hyde. 3 out of 5 Stars. Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Oh waw this is what Twister should be like!; Remember Twister? Well, this movie has probably got the same amount of special effects BUT is much more fun to watch. Let me explain. It has got a story to tell. Twister was only about twisters. Anyway, 'Jumanji' hasn't only got yummy fx, but also a verrrry good cast. Robin Williams ( 26 year old Alan Parrish ), Jonathan Hyde ( Sam Parrish/ Van Pelt ) and Bonnie Hunt ( Sarah Whittle in 1995 ) are the best members of the cast. From the moment the fun starts ( I mean, when they start playing the game ) it never ends. To be honest, the animals in this movie were almost real and I sometimes check my closet before I go to bed. You never know what could be in there... Here's what I think: the special effects deserve 10/10, the cast gets 9/10 so I think the movie must get 9,5/10. Now go and find 'Jumanji'! Wonderful adventure; My opinion: Do not underrate this movie that much. I didn't particularly like it - in fact I almost forgot about it for many years - but the story is simply very, very smart. The idea behind the plot is utter genius. Okay, the actual transformation did not work perfectly, but I insist that it was still a straight accomplishment that had 1. a nice cast, 2. sustainable visual effects and achievements, 3. a great story, 4. both funny and entertaining sequences, that even made you pause and think sometimes, which I regard as a major attainment of any movie. So - I'll give it a solid 7, which it deserves at least. a game not like the other ones; \"Jumanji\" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game \"jumanji\" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy. An excellent family entertainment achievement, with the keyword family, not just kids.; The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children's book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die! Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter  I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Grumpier Old Men Too Sedate *; While Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were an excellent team, they bombed in this film but good. What's so grumpy about Lemmon in this film? The prequel was much better. Ann Guilbert, as Sophia Loren's mother, is given little to do. Remember her as the grandmother to \"The Nanny?\" Sophia Loren, other than marrying Matthau, is also give nothing to do. Ditto for Ann-Margret, Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak, all of whom were so good in the original but are reduced to practically nothing here. I also resent Matthau, who shows off his part-Jewish heritage marrying in a church at the end. I found this to be offensive. Sorry, but that's the way I am-old fashioned. To all those criticize me for the last statement, how would you have felt if the Matthau-Loren nuptials had taken place in a synagogue? While I realize that this was a comedy, this still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. A non-religious setting would have been the only solution to this. Grumpy, but not funny; What, I wonder, does the legendary Billy Wilder think of this film starring Lemmon and Matthau, the great team he so memorably paired in 1966's \"The Fortune Cookie\"?  Wilder's film is a dark, cynical satire, and was the first of what is now seven films starring the pair.  Seven films, but only two of them--\"The Fortune Cookie\" and \"The Odd Couple\"--are genuinely funny efforts showcasing these actors' combined talents.  \"Grumpy Old Men\" was mildly amusing due less to the script than to the welcome return of Lemmon and Matthau who hadn't been on screen together in 12 years.  The unexpected box-office bonanza naturally inspired a sequel, but all this equally lucrative outing has in its favor is a brief monologue by Burgess Meredith who, as Lemmon's 95-year-old father, boasts of eating bacon and smoking Camels while the \"experts\" who warned against such vices are taking a \"dirt nap.\"  Not even Lemmon and Matthau can enliven the script by Mark Steven Johnson this time around.  The curmudgeonly Matthau admitted he didn't lke the script for the first film but did it to work with Lemmon, and that the only reason he did the sequel is because the first film was a hit.  No doubt, \"Grumpiest Old Men,\" the inevitable sequel, will be just as dreary. If these pictures make big bucks, why tamper with the formula?  Why hire Billy Wilder to punch up the quality when the public seems content merely to see Lemmon and Matthau rather than see them at their best? Who would have ever guessed that it's the same place?; For the most part, \"Grumpier Old Men\" is pretty silly. Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still at each other's throats when Italian immigrant Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in town and throws everything into flux. What actually struck me most about the movie was how different the town looked in this one from the original. Obviously, it was a different time of year, but maybe the different look was meant to show how everything might be changing in the town. Other than that, Ann-Margret returns as Ariel, and she's still as free-spirited and vivacious as she was in the original. Burgess Meredith - in his final role - is still the grandfather who can exercise absolute authority over the youngsters, although he now has the hots for Maria's mother (Ann Morgan Guilbert, aka Millie on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\"). Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah also reprise their roles from the original...ah, and there's that fish. All in all, a fairly interesting movie. Not any kind of masterpiece, but it showed that Lemmon and Matthau still had it. Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. after you have seen the first there is no point seeing this one; After the fun of watching Lemmon and Matthau act like kids for less than 2 hours (i.e. from the first movie) I was satisfied, but then due to the success of the first movie the producers decided to give it another twirl, this time the story had the two starting off as friends thanks to the incidents that happened in the ending of the first film, but then some really really idiotic stupid reason, they were at it again. The movie was not funny as it was like a replay of the first, same pranks, similar plot and screenplay made this movie a waste of time. After getting a mate for John, they (the producers) decided to get a mate for Max, with nothing to write home about but a lame script that just showed no finesse or true plan, just the producers hoping to bank on the success of the previous movie. The main disappointment in the movie for me was Sophia Loren; her acting was just too weak for me to understand that she is a star. Everybody else in the movie even Burgess Meredith (who had Alzheimer's disease and this was his last motion picture appearance) was impressive, at least that I can give them. The movie is directed this time by Howard Deutch, who later worked with the duo in 1998 for Odd Couple II, Deutch other movies also have not been well received like Getting Even with Dad (1994) and The Whole Ten Yards (2004), which are basically the reason why I will not bother seeing My Best Friend's Girl. The movie plot carries on 6 months after the incidents of the first, where both John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) were getting prepared for the wedding of their children. Then a new arrival in town a beautiful lady by the name of Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) came in to change things by turning the towns bait shop to a restaurant. John and Max join forces to try and run the new lady out of town, but the issues between John and Max's children marriage plan caused both to reignite their feud as both refused to believe that their child was at fault. Only the ladies are alive till today (February 2013), as both Lemmon and Matthau died like half a decade after this movie release. Grumpier Old Men was a box office success in its own part, but a huge critical disappointment, as the movie cost 10 million dollars less than its predecessor and made like a million more in the box office. After you have seen the first there is basically no point why you should bother seeing this one, because it will stand in my mind as one movie I credit as a waste of time and talent. www.lagsreviews.com forget the fussing; As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Funnier than the first!; This movie is downright hilarious with tons of good one-liners. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (may they both rest in peace) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max &amp; John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says \"Holy moly\" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor! Sophia, twenty years later at 80, is still spectacular.; I saw a picture of Sophia on her eightieth birthday, demurely covering herself with a sheet and a heart-melting smile. All I could think of was the scene where she hitched up her bra and marched through the bar, and every man looked, and I do mean every man. I read later that she had \"improved\" the script for that. A reviewer in the SF Chronicle wrote later that she said she had had no \"touch- ups\", and if so then \"her genes need investigating.\" I remember her many films where her beauty was so natural that it was a wonder any man could concentrate on his lines. She never traded on it, but on her talent as an actress. Carlo Ponti was a lucky man: beauty without guile, talent without pretense. Italian pizza were like street food. When she heard we had so many pizza parlors, she thought we must be a poor country. Then she visited, and dined on American pizza. She reconsidered, gracefully and graciously. A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances...; A sequel to the thoroughly enjoyable Grumpy Old Men, 'Grumpier Old Men' is A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances. The sequel has the spirit of its prequel &amp; the amazing cast, led by the impeccable talents of the Late/Great Jack Lemmon &amp; the Late/Great Walter Matthau, are in full form! 'Grumpier Old Men' Synopsis: John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. 'Grumpier Old Men' works well as a romantic-comedy, as it has moments of humour &amp; subtle romance. I loved the prequel &amp; I must say, the sequel doesn't fail to deliver. The film has sustained its energy &amp; wit, that one would expect from it. Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is entertaining, although initially the pace is slightly slow. Howard Deutch's Direction is top-class. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is good. Editing also is ably done. Performance-Wise: Lemmon &amp; Matthau shine all through. Its their sheer on-screen chemistry, that alone is worth watching the entire film. Sophia Loren is top-notch. Ann-Margret is impressive. Kevin Pollak &amp; Daryl Hannah leave a mark. Late/Great Burgess Meredith is memorable in his part. On the whole, 'Grumpier Old Men' is a smooth, relaxing watch. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10 Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from 1995. The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe 8yrs old, and must have seen it over 100 x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it 15 minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in 1995, 2 years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie 8 out of 10. Mini Ha Has In Minnesota; It's just possible that the intention was to shoot four Grumpy Old Men titles featuring the four seasons because after the Winter setting of the first one we are now in Summer though theoretically such a cycle should have begun with Spring and ended with Winter so maybe the cyclical thing was an afterthought. Whatever we have virtually the same cast doing virtually the same thing with one absentee and two replacements one of which, Anna Guilbert is actually a native of Minneapolis adding a touch of authenticity. If it was unrealistic that Ann Margaret - who, after all, was teaching English at university and would by definition have access to dozens of eligible males - would marry Jack Lemmon in the first film it is equally unrealistic that Sophia Loren would wed Walter Mattheau here other than for feelgood reasons. On the other hand it's probably churlish to nitpick in this way when the film is only intended to entertain. Which it does. great; This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa As Good As The Original; Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\". I don't agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love \"Buddy Buddy\" and \"The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile. very funny.; This film has some of the funniest lines and it's a great comedy. One would probably think, even I, thought that this would probably happen between two older men who fight about the obvious: women, fish and each other. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are a perfect pair. Even though it's a comedy, the romance in it is on the clean side. Nothing too distasteful and the comic relief is still included into the romance, which gives it a continuous comic flow. Even though there is a serious part of the film where John's father passes away, after that scene the film is back to the comic feel, which is nice because there's no dwelling on the sad/serious scene. Nonetheless, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh hard. Sweet and Sad; In this bright sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\" we find John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) at it again. The rivalry never stops. This time, they are bickering over their children's nuptials, almost causing a wedding not to occur. Sophia Loren co-stars as Maria in this foray into the land of 10,000 lakes as the new girl in town that Max has an eye for. At first, they both hate one another because she is turning his beloved tackle shop into a restaurant. Comedy ensues as Max and John both try to get the restaurant shut down and condemned. Eventually, as in the first film, love finds a way. However, sadness veils over as well when Burgess Meredith's character dies. Other than that, the film is very enjoyable. Cute sequel that works; Fun story of two older men who never quite outgrew boyhood, and the ladies they love. What a treat to see two master actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, working with silly material and enjoying every minute of it. The lady loves, Ann Margret and the ever-sexy and dazzling Sophia Loren, do equally well with a lightweight, sometimes over-the-top script. The principals are aided by a uniformly fine supporting cast, including Burgess Meredith as the Lemmon character's outrageously lecherous dad, and Ann Morgan Guilbert as Sophia's feisty mama. The older players' interaction is a delight. My only quibble with this film is the fact that Meredith's character dies without getting married like everyone else. Why? I wondered whether Meredith had perhaps expired during filming, but, according to Wikipedia, the actor lived a whole two years following this movie's release! The original film, \"Grumpy Old Men,\" takes place during a picturesque Minnesota winter, with snow used to charming effect. The follow-up capitalizes on a Midwestern summer. Like apples and oranges, both productions satisfy. the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. 2/5 stars - John Ulmer Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! The good, the bad, and the just plain miserable...again; It's not uncommon for a movie sequel to do little to the formula that made its predecessor so financially (and hopefully critically) successful. The old \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" method of filmmaking has been used in the Hangover, Home Alone, and Taken franchise to only modest success in terms of quality. However, in Grumpier Old Men, the sequel to the fine comedy Grumpy Old Men, handles the rehashed formula better than many film sequels do. While I'm getting to sound repetitive and out of descriptive words, this is largely because of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's chemistry together on-screen. From the moment they appear, it's almost impossible to believe the men's friendship in real life wasn't lifelong and consisted largely of playful torment, vulgarity, and several boys nights out. Had the film been a sequel with few returning cast members (say Lemmon and Matthau were substituted by two other actors), this sequel would've likely been a somber affair to view. In a way, I'm thankful the town of Wabasha Minnesota hasn't really changed much since our last outing, with the exception of John Gustafson (Jack Lemon) marrying Ariel (Ann-Margret) from the original film. In the meantime, John's dad still lives off a diet of beer, cigarettes, and bacon and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), John's cantankerous neighbor, still finds himself engaging in petty neighborhood battles with John about outwitting the other man. However, the big ordeal this time is not competing for a new neighbor's love but trying to save a local bait shop from becoming a \"restaurante\" for Italian cuisine. The restaurant is managed by Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren), a gorgeous but uncompromisingly strict woman who catches the eye of Max even as him and Jack plan to foil the restaurant's forthcoming prosperity. Other events (aka subplots) occurring in Wabasha are the wedding between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah), a plot which would later be used by the same director Howard Deutch in The Odd Couple II, also starring Lemmon and Matthau, along with John trying to get his father (Burgess Meredith in his final role, which was burdened by spouts with Alzheimer's and difficultly remembering lines, some female company as he gets older. One of Grumpier Old Men's immediate issues is that there is simply too much going on between plot-strands that involve marriage/romance troubles (I counted four including John's brief trouble with Ariel later in the movie) ad others that involve trying to sabotage the bait-shop-turned-restaurant. Grumpier Old Men may have too many new ideas for cutesy subplots, but it keeps the tone and feel of its predecessor alive and well. It still feels like Wabasha is the location of a sitcom with its oddball situations that seem to consistently bear hefty consequences for its residents, but its characters still feel like real people we've come to known and care about. Unsurprisingly, Lemmon and Matthau share unbelievable conversational beauty in the way they engage in simple discussions that seem to constantly end in uproariously funny bickering. Once you minimize your focus on that aspect in the film, you have just an average comedy that, while charming and pleasantly safe (a good and bad quality for this particular kind of picture), is just grateful to be buoyed by two very talented leading men. Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Sophia Loren, and Burgess Meredith. Directed by: Howard Deutch. A vibrant sequel that's still underwhelming; I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They seem to work perfectly together, and with a better script, this movie could be gold. We are taken back to Minnesota to re-visit the old grumps who now have to plan a wedding for their very plain and very boring children. There's a reason Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah have never had substantial film careers- they're very uninteresting actors. But I digress. If \"Grumpy Old Men\" built up it's laughs, \"Grumpier Old Men\" topples them down. The best moments of both films are when Lemmon and Matthau trade vicious insults at one another, and also play pranks on each other. But when this is taken away, we're suffering every old cliché in the book, including Walter's tiresome 'Wholey Moley' line which is used so much, it could be taken into context for a Shot Party (take a shot every time Matthau 'Wholey Moley''s himself). The other problem with this series is the fact that gorgeous women fall for these two farts. Roger Ebert made a very valid point in his review for this film- first Ann-Margaret moves into the neighborhood and marries Jack Lemmon. Now the even more gorgeous Sophia Loren has set her sights on the incredibly unattractive Matthau. And why? For concepts in the plot. There's no reason a woman as beautiful and intelligent as Loren would fall for the dull and disgusting figure Matthau is. I know this is a comedy, but come on now! All in all this sequel is peppier and a little more fun then the original, but both movies suffer from overblown dramatic passages that are not needed. We want to see the old guys go at it, not Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah. I laughed a lot at this movie- mostly at the incredibly underrated Bergis Meredith as the foul-mouthed Grandpa. Since all three main actors have passed, we'll never see them again. At least Margaret and Loren are still alive and kicking. I'd love to see their movie: \"Grumpy Old Widows\". The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5. Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. not much fun; Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still combative while maintaining their truce. John is married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) now and his father (Burgess Meredith) is still spry. Everybody is chasing after the big fish Catfish Hunter. Meanwhile, their children Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are planning to get married. Newcomer Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in Wabasha to buy the bait shop and turn it into an Italian restaurant. It's a continuation that's missing much of the fun. It is contrived. It's great to see these great actors working together but that's all I got out of it. I found very few laughs. Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. Back For More!; CONTAINS SPOILERS John Gustafson and Max Goldman are back in their first adventure since their last. It's six months later and they're still fishing. All the snow has melted and the neighborhood looks very different. The boys are out to catch a giant legendary fish they've heard tell about.          These men would soon discover big changes happening. Like, their friend Chuck, who died in the last adventure, had operated the bait shop. Ever since his demise, it's been empty, but some people have come with plans to turn it into a ristorante (restaurant). They are: Mama Regetti and daughter Maria. John and Max don't want that to happen so they pull numerous pranks on the Regettis but they still won't leave.         Jacob Goldman and Melanie Gustafson contemplate matrimony. But have their doubts when their fathers insist on planning the event. But when the kids decide the wedding is off, John and Max are back at it. Pulling all sorts of foolish pranks on one another. Max steals John's outboard motor, John wrecks Max's fish net and has his cat scratch up Max's car seats, but Max sends a big dog through John's house. Ariel decides to leave for a while. John was in a real pickle. He tried asking his father for advice, but he had passed away; Max goes on a date with Maria and they decide they like one another.        Pretty soon, it's a wedding day. En route to the church, Max and John decide to fish for the giant musket they're so fond of. They catch it, but John says they must leave it in the lake out of respect for his father, so they do and rush to church. It looks like the wedding of Jacob and Melanie, but it isn't. They eloped. It's the wedding of Max and Maria. John planted Max's dog in the limo as they drive off.        Was this as good as the first? Sure. I'm sorry to say that the three main stars, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith are no longer with us. Meredith died in 1998, Matthau in 2000 and Lemmon in 2001, which is real sad. So it's guarenteed there will never be an Even Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple III. They were really funny men. Why do the good ones always gotta die? But anyway, if you're a fan of these men and you enjoyed the first one, then I recommend Grumpier Old Men! - Still having a good ol' time!; I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men back to back, so I could see both instead of my normal rent one sequel at a time ordeal. I just finished Grumpier Old Men this morning and was expecting a modest sequel, but it turned into a great sequel, pretty much to the point where I enjoyed Grumpier Old Men to Grumpy Old Men. Despite the fact that they use some old jokes, this was a fun plot and I thought the guys have gotten even funnier, including John's father, he's a little dirty, but so much fun to laugh at. John and Max are now best friends again and couldn't be happier with each other, their son and daughter are about to get hitched, and they are overwhelming with the wedding plans. Max is starting to get lonely though, since Chuck has passed on, the bait shop is given to two older Italian women, one lady, Maria, starts a little feud with Max wanting to turn the bait shop into a restaurant. But their anger turns into a hidden passion and they end up falling head over heals for each other, but Maria has some hidden skeletons in her closet. Grumpier Old Men is proof that you are never too old to fall in love or have your heart broken again. It was so sweet seeing Max fall in love with Maria, I loved their passion for each other, it was so fun to watch. John's father and Maria's mother were just so awesome and funny, they had such great chemistry! I would highly recommend Grumpier Old Men, it's a great comedy that once again touches your heart and tickles your funny bone. 8/10 1/10; this movie sucked! I hate it! It's so boring! The acting is so bad! Why does Sophia Loren's italian character talk english to her italian mother when they're alone? The script is so bad! It's so corny! Max and John fighting with the fishing things is so silly! This movie was never funny! It was painful to watch, i'm telling you! Avoid it! Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter &amp; Jack's previous films together. It was this film &amp; the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max &amp; John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life &amp; Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau &amp; Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman &amp; John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a 7.4 out of 10 Snoozing sequel with the leads in need of some No-Doz; Woeful, disappointing sequel to 1993's hit \"Grumpy Old Men\" is more retread than follow-up. The two crotchety neighbors--Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--bicker over their children (who will soon be making the sparring oldsters in-laws!) and, of course, who has the better fishing skills. They stop trading insults long enough for Matthau to begin irritating a new woman in town, a fiery Italian who has just opened her own restaurant. Sitcom humor with a sometimes-raunchy twist that is no longer fresh. Almost worth-seeing for Sophia Loren's funny, lively performance, but everyone else looks a little sleepy. Ann-Margret (who married Lemmon's character at the end of the original) must've dropped in for a day and a half to complete her work. As the youthful couple, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah are also under-used. ** from **** As equally funny as the original, but with an Italian flair!!!!; This sequel to Grumpy Old Men is as funny as the original. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and the rest of the cast from the original movie reprise their roles. John and Max are still feuding, but the tension between them has softened. There are, however, some changes: Ariel and John are married and there's a new girl in town named Maria Ragetti. She's moved to Wabasha to open up an Italian restaurant at the former Chuck's Bait place. When the boys discover what Maria's intentions are, they hatch a scheme to ruin the grand opening of the restaurant and try to keep Chuck's business going, even though the inventory of the former business has been cleared out and the interior remodeled to look like an Italian restaurant. Max and Sophia meet, but there's a disagreement about what the place should be. Maria goes to the neighborhood bar to try and reason with Max, but to no avail. It seems as though Max and John have trouble saying goodbye to what is no longer there. The humor between Lemmon and Matthau's characters is still spiced up and is still able to put viewers in stitches. Then, Max and Maria get married, and the restaurant starts selling bait, as well. Great movie, great cast, great fun!! Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) funny funny; I, too, found the film very funny and until reading about it here couldn't remember who played the other woman with Burgess Meredith at the end of the film, the scene that made the whole film complete.  Without giving away what happened at the end of the film, the other woman was that gorgeous elder lady of many great films - Sophia Loren.  What a delicious surprise!  Good also for any old grumpy man! Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. 7/10 stars. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT 7 out of 10 \"Good Lemmon &amp; Matthau Comedy Sequel!\"; Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Kevin Pollack, Daryl Hannah and Burgess Meredith star in this 1995 comedy sequel. This takes place about 6 months later where John (Lemmon) is now married to Ariel (Margret) and he and Max (Matthau) are sort of getting along. This time, Max finds romance when he meets Maria Ragetti (Loren), an Italian widow who moves into town and opens a restaurant. Jacob (Pollack) and Melanie (Hannah) are also engaged and things start to get a bit difficult for them which makes their dads feud with each other, but only temporarily. The late, Meredith (Rocky) also returns as John's father and this was his final film. This is a good sequel and like the first film, it provides laughs and a bit of heartfelt moments as well. I recommend this. Oh, How The Mighty Have Fallen...; GRUMPY OLD MEN (3 outta 5 stars) GRUMPIER OLD MEN (2 outta 5 stars) I dunno why I even bothered to watch the second one. Oh, I guess because it was on cable TV shown as a double bill with the original \"Grumpy Old Men\". I liked the original when I first saw it. It was not the best work by the Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau team... but it had its moments... these two actors could probably read pages from the phone book to each other and still make it funny. Unfortunately, the sequel has even FEWER of those moments. Still, I maintain that no movie with either Lemmon OR Matthau in it can be *totally* worthless. This is probably as close as they ever got, though. (Bear in mind that I have not yet seen their last movie together, \"The Odd Couple II\".) Practically the same plot as the first movie... Lemmon and Matthau play lifelong acquaintances and next door neighbors who are constantly bickering about fish and/or women. Burgess Meredith plays Lemmon's FATHER... and if you find old people talking dirty hilarious then you'll probably love his scenes (especially in the closing credits outtakes). Ann Margaret and Sophia Loren play the women in the grumpy guys' lives... hard to imagine that women as attractive as they still are would want anything to do with these two old dorks but, hey... I guess pickings are slim after 65. Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. A sequel that's equal to the original comedy; The first go round was such a hit, that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau got together for this sequel to the 1993 smash hit, \"Grumpy Old Men.\" And \"Grumpier Old Men\" is every bit as good as the first film. It has some new characters and the scene changes from winter to summer, then winter and spring. Most reviewers don't talk about the surprise of the wedding in the first film. And I won't do that for that film or this one. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) team up for a time in the movie to plan the wedding of their daughter and son, Melanie and Jacob (played by Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak). And, later, to try to thwart the conversion of their bait shop into an Italian restaurant. Sophia Loren is the added ingredient for much humor as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti. She's a cousin of \"Spaghetti\" Ragetti, whom John and Max know. Her mother is in the picture, Mama Ragetti, played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. And, grandpa Gustafson is back, with Burgess Meredith now a couple years older. He tells son, John, as they sit by the lake drinking beer, that he sometimes thinks God has forgotten about him. The hijinks and capers in this film include some hilarious pranks the two friendly enemies pull on the Ragettis. As with the original film, this one supposedly takes place in Wabasha, Minnesota. While it is a real town on the Mississippi River border with Wisconsin, the filming for this and the earlier movie was done in a number of places around that area of southeastern Minnesota. So, anyone going to Wabasha won't find the fishing lake, the town overlook or some other scenes shown in these films. With the 10 films they made together  especially the nine comedies, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have delighted audiences for decades. May they outlive Catfish Hunter and continue amuse people for decades to come. OLDER, HORNIER AND STILL FRUSTRATED IN MINNESOTA;  `Grumpier Old Men' is a film that is a sequel to `Grumpy Old Men.' Reprising their original roles are Jack Lemmon as John Gustafson, Walter Matthau as Max Goldman, Ann Margaret as Ariel, Burgess Meredith as John's father, Kevin Pollock and Darryl Hannah as the children of Max and John. They are still next-door neighbors, only now the feud has subsided. Their children are living across the street in Ariel's house.  The marriage of their children is on the horizon. The setting for this film is summer and fall in Minnesota.  Fishing is still the main sport where `Catfish Hunter' is still the elusive prize.  The bait shop on the lake has been closed since Chuck passed away.  It is now under new management.  John and Max are anxiously waiting the reopening.  To their surprise, it is not being reopened as a bait shop, but a ristorante (restaurant).  Here enters Sophia Loren as the new proprietress Maria Sophia Calotti Ragetti.  Ann Guilbert who plays her mother joins her.  When Max and John find out the new plans for their favorite bait shop, they set out to undermine her plans for a grand opening.  A series of misunderstandings set off a domino effect that touches everyone's lives.  New loves are found and an old feud is rekindled. All of the same emotions that were in the previous film are in this film. There is laughter, sadness, anger and happiness.  Catfish Hunter makes his film debut, which, in essence, puts a `face' with a name.  His film appearance pays credence to the fact that he is a `real' fish and not just a myth.   The acting in this film is superb both by human and non-human.  The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down. Loren is still hot; Grumpy old men was an OK comedy with a nice performance by Ann-Margret, but otherwise forgettable. This film, on the other hand, has some real comic touches that actually also have something to say about the aging process - and life really doesn't end until it ends. But first the bad news: Daryl Hannah. I've liked her in other films, but she is so flat in this, she's a distraction. She doesn't have the feel for these characters, not even her own, and so doesn't quite fit. She's not even credible as the mother of the young girl who is so important in her relationship to great=grand-dad Burgess Meredith. There must have been some plot device they could have come up with to leave her out of the picture altogether; oh, well. Now the really good news: Sophia Loren. I admit I have always had a crush on her since I saw Houseboat as a kid; and when I saw the shower scene in Arabesque, i couldn't sleep for a week. Her performance here is splendid (romantic comedy is one of her strengths, after all), but the really really good news is that she was past sixty when she made this film, and she looks hot enough to burn a young man's fingers! Really - if I'd been Walter Matthau in that bar scene, I'd have gone out with a heart-attack right there - and smiling. With an adequate script, and such superb actors, Deutsch wisely lets the formula roll on without interference. Consequently, whatever the short-comings there's plenty to remember fondly from this film. Oh, and don't miss the blooper-reel that runs under the final credits - Matthau and Meredith are having a grand old time. Oh, and Sophia Loren is still hot. Grumpier Old Men (1995) **1/2; More of the same for those who enjoyed the first film, nothing great but a decent time killer. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return in their twilight years as the ever-battling duo, but this time with the added attraction of Sophia Loren who still looks gorgeous at age 60. She winds up posing a threat to their favorite bait and tackle shop when she decides to take it over and turn it into an Italian restaurant. Since Lemmon's already got sexy Ann-Margret as his hot girlfriend, Sophia hits it off with old man Matthau (ah, the magic of movies), who does not look as good for his age (75). Burgess Meredith is better used in this one in his role as Lemmon's naughty old pop. **1/2 out of **** charming and funny light romantic comedy; It may be just me but I found Grumpier Old Men way way better than Grumpy Old Men. I laughed more and got involved in the plot much more. That it is totally 100% predictable every step of the way is only one of its charms... its how you get there where the fun is. And these actors turn in surprisingly memorable performances for such a slight film. I thought Sophia Loren turned in one of her most charming and funny performances, as did everyone else. The story was just more interesting and three dimensional than the first film and flowed more organically. The story line is simple ancient classic romantic comedy that these veterans had done so many times, it seemed for them like doing a well-known dance. The fun is not in surprises but in going through the old steps with joy. The actors move through their paces with simplicity and enthusiasm and the film actually captures very well the effects of love. The whole film hangs together and works in a way that, for me, the first one didn't. It gets airborne. It deserves a higher ranking than my seven except the story is a little too well-worn. It also allows the two protagonists to get a little more real with each other. Even the three charismatic animal actors get caught up in the spirit of fun. One thing about the film that gave me trouble was that all four women being courted in the film are talented, accomplished, strong and magnificent while all four of the men are hamstrung. I found it mysterious that these women, dropped by some miracle into this tiny town, would be so strongly attracted. Pretty Dang Funny; John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. We often expect sequels to be weaker than the original. But sometimes we may be pleasantly surprised. In this sequel, the \"grumpy old men\" are still up to their old tricks, going after each other and teaming up to close down a restaurant. Some of it may be a bit far-fetched (in real life, a store owner would get the cops involved) but it's good fun. Sadly, the film has the distinction of being Burgess Meredith's final film. On the plus side, he really goes out with a bang. His acting and delivery of witty lines is top notch, and the film does a great job of hiding his Alzheimer's. You can really feel the talent in his character. It has it's moments; Howard Deutch decided he wanted to cash in on the success of Grumpy Old Men and it worked. The only problem to the sequel is that some of the cast seem to be a bit bored by the proceedings. The one liners are enough to make you drop your popcorn. Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon are a joy to watch as they continue to find ways to drive each other over the edge into insanity. And yet Deutch calms that insanity by giving us a quick glimpse into just how much these two men mean to each other when Jack's dad played by Burgess Meredith dies. Lemmon and Mathau are still at the top of their game in this film. In this film the Ann Margaret character is suppose to be the rock, the sound of reason, the calm in the midst of the storm. You believe she is until she has the insanity thrust upon her and is forced to react. For the most part Ann Margaret as well as Daryl Hannah seem bored throughout the entire film. Kevin Pollack is just as good in this sequel as in the original. Burgess Meredith is the scene stealer, he manages with dead pan accuracy to deliver some of the best one liners in the film. Ann Morgan Guilbert manages to match Burgess with her ability to respond to his one liners with shock and outrage befitting her character. And then you come to Sophia. Sophia is in her comfort zone here. Sophia is comfortable with the slapstick comedy and relishes it, she's in the movie, she's not walking through it. She's absolutely stunning to watch but at the same time she adds to the moment. She's as glamorous as ever but it doesn't get in the way. All in all a good follow up to the original. Good Laughs; Grumpier Old Men (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to Grumpy Old Men have Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau returning with more fights and foul language. This time out Lemmon is still happily married but Matthau is on the move and takes a special interest in an Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved to town. I think the most remarkable thing about this film is how well Loren looked. Even at 61 she's still a head turner and her comic timing isn't too bad either. I'm sure this film was only made because the first one made money but it doesn't really matter as no one should take this too serious as it's just a silly comedy meant to make you laugh. There are plenty of nice laughs here but I don't think it's as good as the original. This certainly isn't in the league as The Odd Couple but we do get a pretty good throwback to that film here as there's a scene where Lemmon has to spend the night with Matthau but can't put up with his dirty house. Ann-Margret returns but is pretty much wasted as is Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak. The perverted Burgess Meredith is back and steals the scene every time he's in it. Both Matthau and Lemmon are naturally very good and they easily slip back into their roles. It's priceless watching the two men work together even when the material isn't as strong as one would hope. Lemmon gets a special notice here due to a very touching scene with Meredith. Another problem is the direction, which has one of those \"made for TV\" feels to it. In the end this film could have and should have been a lot better but the cast make it worth watching. Delightful acting and script but silly scenes...; Always delighting in Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, warmed by their aging and childish pranks, I enjoyed this film which is filled with delightful acting and fun script.It suffers, however,  from more than a few silly scenes. Great!; This is a rare sequel. Wait a minute, sequels aren't rare. Well, that's true, but a *good* sequel is rare. Most of the time, sequels aren't even in the same league as the originals. However, due to excellent writing, a superb cast and great direction, this film is every bit as enjoyable as Grumpy Old Men. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made several films together and they worked together extremely well. The gorgeous Ann Margaret reprises her role from the first film and is now Lemmon's wife. A new lady hits town and Matthau is very interested. This lovely creature is played by Sophia Loren, who is still stunningly beautiful. Burgess Meredith is great as Grandpa. The stellar cast ensures great acting. However, this film is also written such that there is literally a laugh nearly every minute. I found the film to be highly enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh. Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the 1st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. One of the best movies of 1995!; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Is it better than original?; Is this movie better than the original? Perhaps. It's probably funnier than the original. Walter Matthau's pick-up line is one of the funniest things of the movie. But is it better than the original? The original had more of the emotions of Lemmon and Matthau as they fought. This one has less feuding (but still has some of the old pranks) and more focus on the family / dating relationships of the old men. This movie is funny and definitely worth watching. You'll have to decide on your own if it's better than the original.</td>\n",

       "      <td>An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Excellent for the broken heart...; Perhaps the reason they call this movie a chick flick, is because that's exactly who it's aimed at. Women. I don't see this as a man bashing movie, but more as a \"how do you deal?\" type of movie. It covers every situation: The unworthy co-worker, The drug-addict boyfriend, the gay husband, the cheating husband, the married man, the New Years fling, the sweet attractive neighbor, the teenage son....but most importantly, it show how women react and deal with the lies, the cheating, and the friendships between both men AND women...and how to survive from that. Any woman who has ever gone through a relationship can relate to this movie, regardless of race, situation, or age. You will want to scream, cry and laugh throughout the whole movie, and I can guarantee that every woman has got a little Angela Bassett in her, especially when she rips through her ex-husbands belongings. Two thumbs up...A definite must-see for any woman with a wounded heart. This film does Terry McMillan's writing no justice; This movie had great potential had it landed in the right directors hands (as seen with How Stella got Her Groove Back).  Many rough cuts, sloppy editing, and terrible lighting at times to name a few.  Casting was excellent with the exception of Whitney Houston who has the tendency to over-chew her scenes.  Though much of the book was not adapted to the film the strength and love amongst four friends was apparent.  It was the one thing that was not lost or left on the cutting room floor.  Good movie, better book. Waiting to Exhale (the movie) ***** (5 stars) Waiting to Exhale (the novel) ********** (ten stars) FAbuLOuS; Simply fabulous. I thought it was a great movie. I was completely empowered! It made me want to start my exes car on fire. Embrace your independence  watch this movie. (is great to watch with the scorned over glasses of wine and bon bons) It'll make you laugh, cry, get mad, and then plot getting even. I can waste a lot of your time telling you to see it, defending it from what others say about it, or just generally talking it up. But haven't you always wanted to see Angela Basset throw a fit? How bout cut her hair off? And who wouldn't want to watch Whitney act with humility. This is by far my favorite movie with Whitney - second, The Bodyguard - third, The Preachers Wife. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Pathetic; This film is simply about a bunch of women who pick men who's behaviors they claim to hate &amp; then spend the rest of their time complaining about them. It seems that this view is held by many women &amp; possibly accounts in some measure to the number of women who consider their relationships with men to be unsatisfying. This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation. Hilarious in Parts; 1995 was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in 1995, the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops &amp; horrible movies. Don't Exhale Just Yet; I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It's not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others, it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However, the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria -- even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger, Holly Hunter, Alfre Woodard and others. Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight, insecure no-nonsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight, but she was the only one who found it (and deserved it). She was the only one who didn't sleep around, wasn't a man basher, set a good example for her son, and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face -- look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things, her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent, good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie. Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package --- beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life - she could now start her catering business, she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end. Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book, you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men. Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same -- Whitney Houston being well groomed, pretending to be well spoken and classy, and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise (although she might have been too young). The character had to tell us she was smart -- in a phone conversation with her mother she said \"I'm smart, I'm a good person and I work hard.\" Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills, doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end. This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn't \"tell this story\" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were. Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue? Double Standard; So I finally got around to watching \"Waiting to Exhale\" on Encore the other night and I don't understand why this became a hit. (Note: spoilers ahead) As far as I can tell, the basic premise of this film is that all men are insensitive, callous and unfeeling; especially towards women. Okay, well and good. That is the storyline? Fine. Men suck, got it. But there is a huge double standard here; two of the women are dating married men and clearly, we are meant to be sympathetic about their plight as they whine and cry about not having \"their\" man with them at night in bed. How about this? STOP DATING MARRIED MEN! Maybe that's your problem in the first place. Now, on the flip side, Angela Basset's character is abandoned by her husband for another woman. Yet, if you pay attention, even this character is not completely innocent. When her husband informs her he is leaving, the things she says makes it clear she's known about his lover(s) for years but ignored his infidelities. Why? Obviously, because he's so wealthy. She liked all the \"stuff\" a little too much to have confronted him about it. Again, she's made her bed here, not as completely as the two who are actively cheating, but still. She spends the rest of the movie being so angry that he left her you never really grow to like her. Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer; he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar. With their clothes on, which apparently means it's oh-so-platonic and sweet. Then he writes her a letter months later, thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off, he'll contact her again. Did anyone else think this was more than a little sleazy? I would hope if I were dying of breast cancer that my husband wasn't out sleeping around (and I do mean just sleeping) with other women. Sweet, platonic, whatever; I think it's pretty horrible. Bottom line; the characters you're supposed to connect to are unlikable and the ones you're supposed to hate are just pathetic. Not very enjoyable. However, I did give it three stars for the music, which didn't suck too badly and the clothes and style. It's a nice little snapshot of how things looked in '95. And the print wasn't very faded. That's about it, though. Extra in Movie; I was actually an extra in this movie and had a quite a fun time hanging out w/the cast/crew. I had an opportunity to be at several of the locations for days of filming and it was a lot of work. You don't realize what a day of filming entitles until you actually do it and I was just an extra. I was more interested in the process of the film making than being on camera so it was a great opportunity. I even got \"spoiled\" and met a lot of the cast and drove around in the SUV's that are for the main cast...fun stuff! I think over all the movie was to enjoy for fun. I think the basis of the friendships were the most important aspect of the film. That through all the craziness of men in their lives they were still there for one another. This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Good movie, Better book; This wasn't a bad movie. The acting was great (although Whitney Houston still seems mediocre). Some of the scenes were powerful and funny. However, unlike the book which also deals with the sisterhood of Black women, the movie becomes a long \"Men are pigs\" tirade that gets weary after a while. Plus it's sometimes hard to root for the characters. For instance, considering all the one-night stands Savannah has, it's hard to see why she's questioning her ability to find a good man. Overall, Waiting to Exhale, is basically a sorely-needed bonding movie for African-American women that, while a little biased, is good escapist fun. Sticky; There was nothing in the movie that made me excited. The message did not come through,  if there was one. Perhaps it is to convey the idea that men are useless,  or that relations are complicated because women make it complicated. If a comedy,  I did not laugh.  If a drama,  I did not find it dramatic. It was like drinking a cup of coffee presented to you with way too much sugar. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. Whitney ruined the great potential; Angela Basset was good as expected, but Whitney has no Range as an actress. The screenplay also neglected to portray, on film, the greatness of this novel.  Instead of promoting sisterhood, they emphasized the canine-qualities of men.  Read the book; rent Soul Food instead! Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. I wanna move to Arizona; I thought It was a great movie, although it is a lot of sleeping with other women husband that are taken, we all have to be honest, this goes on a lot in reality. it's not right, but it happens.... Overall I really enjoy the movie because it took me way back to 1995, the movie was great. great times, although I was just 11 when it came out, I remember all the hype over this movie from my mom n my aunts.... One factor that I've never notice before was the setting... It makes me wanna pack up my family an move to peaceful Arizona.. Great Movie. r.i.p. Whitney Houston I cannot believe it took me all this time to see this movie all the way through... Frustrating...; That's the word I'd use to describe the film, an adaptation of Terry McMillan's 1992 best-seller. It's not great, it's not bad, but it's frustrating to watch, and the fact that I'm of the male persuasion undoubtedly had something to do with it. Now, let me be the first to say that I did enjoy seeing a group of strong black women portrayed onscreen. To say that Hollywood has been exceedingly lax in this regard is an understatement. But it would've been nice if their collective talents hadn't been squandered on this disgustingly anti-male tirade. Especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine, who otherwise shine in everything their names are attached to. Good, solid movies about sisterhood are probably needed now more than ever, but not at the cost of shortchanging the good, upright, decent brothers out there, whom this movie largely forgets about (with some notable exceptions -- Gregory Hines, for example.) And the frustration doesn't end there. Both Savannah and Robin manage to find themselves involved with the most shady characters (a married man and a dope fiend, respectively), yet they complain about the lack of good men out there. I suppose it would be silly to question just where they've been looking, even though it might hold the answer. The sad thing is that there are fellas out there who have little to no regard for women (\"the scum of the f__king earth\", to quote Savannah), and women who fall for fellas like that for the most silly, shallow reasons. If it wasn't for Bassett, Devine, and Babyface's score, this movie would barely be watchable. As it is, it's a moderately entertaining diversion, albeit a frustrating one. A 3 is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. great touching story; While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life's mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Great female flick of the '90s!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track 6: This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! A real disaster!; This movie is awful! The caracters are shallow and almost ridiculous, especially Lela Rochon. It's a very, very, very bad soap opera. I was watching this movie with my wife and we were laughing almost all the time. It is much too long, with no rhythm with absolutely no emotions. It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one cliché after another. Skip it, it's a waste of time! The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" My favorite movie ever !; I'm so surprised by the comments i read here. Since i saw that movie maybe 10 years ago now, it's one of my favorite movie ever along with boomerang.Maybe it's because i was fairly young when i watched those movies.. but i find them extremely good. I watched the movie before i read the book and it may be the reason why i loved the movie so much. Sure Whitney's acting could have been better but she managed to do a pretty decent job overall. As for the soundtrack it's a pure bliss for RnB lovers and i would say a classic now. The image of Black men in the movie is very negative but in a sens it pushed to be the exact opposite so it kinda shaped my vision and my life, and \"deepend\" my love of black women. Some parts of the movie are just so classic like the break up between Robin and troy on the balcony and the soundtrack at that moment was some kind of a symphony.. anyways great great movie .. enjoy A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about 15 or 16 and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker. 6 of 10 stars. A bit too soapy but deserves respect for being a positive film for black women; Vannah is travelling to see her friend Bernie while leaving behind all her old live to start anew.  Bernie has just been left by her husband of 13 years for a white woman.  Robin wants to be loved and happy but always makes the wrong choices.  Glo has an estranged husband and the only man in her life is her teenage son.  The four get together through their struggles in love and live as they try to put it all together again. This is very much a woman's film and, as a man, it's easy for me to criticise it for being a weepy or for being a bit of a woman love in, so I won't.  The plot is pure soap opera, the lives and loves of our 4 women, however it is still involving as the four stories all have strengths as well as weaknesses.  The mix of comedy and sentiment is a bit too much 20:80 and at times the sentiment gets too much, but the sassy characters keep the interest. The soapy sentiment isn't helped by a poor soundtrack and poor use there of. In itself I like some of the love ballad r'n'b stuff  but here it felt like it was all over every scene.  This really bogs it down. Also a down side is the whole man hating thing  only a few come off looking good.  I thought the director being a man would help redress the balance but it seemed to have no effect. Why  can someone tell me  was Houston chosen to lead this talented black cast?  Was it because she could do a cut price soundtrack?  She's a poor actress and he spoiled her scenes  she needs to stay in TVM's.  Bassett however is powerful as ever and really steals every single scene she's in.  Devine adds comedy and sauce while Rochon is perfect as the vulnerable beauty going about love the wrong way.  The male cast is great too  there are so many well known faces in this with only two criticisms of them  1  everytime I see Haysbert now all I can think of is his 24 character.  And 2  Wesley Snipes' character just don't convince me at all. Overall to criticise this for being girly or sentimental is to miss the point.  It is actually good to see a film with so many good roles for black actresses.  It's a bit too soapy for my taste but it is funny and involving with a commanding Bassett.  Only Huston, a soppy soundtrack and constant man caricatures spoil it. WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. I give this one 2 out of 10. not bad; this movie and its story are quite good on the whole..........Ms Bassett is the leading and the best actress,for sure.I get her character.she's beautiful and I guess she's blown people away with her beauty and the EASE WITH WHICH SHE FASCINATES.Ms HOUSTON IS NOT TO NEGLECT NEITHER.She looks natural in this one.And despite her little experience as far as her actress career is concerned,she is good even though her story is a bit common .Loretta is divine!Anyways,this motion picture is merely good.There's nothing amazing.And it don't stand out from all the other movies.the only thing that makes me stick to the screen is the complicity and the crude humor on men of the four ladies! Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this 1995 film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. A One-Sided Celebration of African American Feminism; Directed by Forest Whitaker and adapted from a smash best selling novel by Terry McMillan, WAITING TO EXHALE is a glossy, but one-sided look at the relationship between four strong black women and the various men in their lives. The film is one-sided because the screenplay presents most of the male characters as sexist, manipulative pigs without a redeeming characteristic in sight, but the sensitive direction and outstanding performances keep the rather lopsided story watchable. Whitney Houston made an impressive film debut as Savannah, an ambitious television executive caught in a dead-end affair with a married man (Dennis Haysbert). Angela Basset does Oscar-worthy work as Bernadine, a woman who has spent her life being the best wife and mother she knows how to be, who has her world rocked when her wealthy husband (Michael Beach) calmly announces one night before a formal dinner party that he's in love with someone else and wants a divorce. The scene where Bernadine gathers all her husband's stuff and makes a bonfire out of it in her driveway is one of the film's highlights. Lela Rochon plays Robin, a not-too-bright doormat who finds herself pregnant by a man she wants nothing to do with. Loretta Devine is fun as Gloria, a hairdresser who is divorced from her husband, who it turns out was gay, and is struggling to raise her son (Donald Faison) and tries to begin a relationship with a new neighbor (Gregory Hines). If you can accept the fact that in the world of these four women, all men are pigs, then this film can be very entertaining but the top-notch performances by the cast cannot be overlooked. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Feel Good Movie; The acting in this film is phenomenal, especially on the part of Angela Bassett who always does an amazing job (see What's Love Got To Do With It). The inter-cuts work well where they are placed, much like all of the other shots, and keep the films pace and the viewer interested. I've read other user comments and I find their opinions to be completely biased and unwarranted. If you're watching this film looking for profound insight to life you will be disappointed. This film is an adaptation of Terry McMillan's critically acclaimed novel FOR BLACK FEMALES. Waiting to Exhale explores the lives of four female friends. Each woman makes mistakes and has to deal with those consequences. But it is through being there for one another that they overcome these problems and others. For me, most of the negative user comments are from people who the film was not made for, that are only analyzing the film from the story. There is more to a film than it's narrative and when base your full opinion on that alone you are missing out. Plus, for me, it's just flat-out annoying when people who are completely not the target audience bash a film. Note: this is not to say that art cannot breach color, age or sex barriers. But be let's be realistic for a moment. If say, a heterosexual, black, 21 year old female studying Art was asking you for a good movie suggestion for a Friday night...Would you suggest The Dukes Of Hazard? I think not. Not unless you were joking. Hot Soundtrack, Terrible Character Development; Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end.  It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.  However, much of this is wasted on poor character development.  Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover.  What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies.  While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all.  For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script.  Clearly the answer is that it isn't.  Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with.  Why the director didn't see this, I don't know. Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface. 4/10 Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" WAITING TO EXHALE : Waiting To Go Somewhere, But Sadly It Never Does...; WAITING TO EXHALE Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. \"Waiting To Exhale\", Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book, had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it's star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene. \"Waiting To Exhale\" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone. It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn't know the word \"feelings\" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change. For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they've experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don't seem to learn squat. It's like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. \"Waiting To Exhale\" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose. ... D ... Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life. Please. Sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE HARD TRUTH) looked VERY beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts REALLY made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Decent; Those of you who ranted and raved about how horrible this film was really tickle my funny bone. I love to see miserable people hate a movie just because...well, they have nothing to better to do. Not saying this was the best movie I've ever seen. But I agree with others who say that Bassett and Levine are the ones to save this film from drowning with all the other horrible movies. I love Angela Bassett, I'm a huge fan of hers. The scene which depicts the morning after her husband leaves her for his secretary, which would've otherwise been too cliché for my taste had it not been for the way Bernie (Bassett) burned up that BMW! I mean that was classic. Sorry if any of you testosterone-fueled men out there will accuse me of man hating, but I love that scene and will watch it over and over again. Three cheers for Angie. And Devine's character, Gloria seems sort of weak and unable to stand up to even her teenage son, but I love how she bends a little and confesses how she feels to the late Gregory Hines' character. You'll notice Devine's Gloria and Bassett's Bernie are slightly juxtaposed but their chemistry is excellent. If you haven't seen it, check it out, if not for anything but the performance of these two gifted actors. in response to your response; I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Entertaining, but the premise has been worn thin -- it's sweet, but unnecessary.; The original \"Father of the Bride\" with Spencer Tracey is a really good comedy, the remake starring Steve Martin is a good sweet-natured, amiable enough comedy - and I don't really think a sequel was necessary at all. I mean the whole premise is basically the same - before George Banks (Martin) had to grasp the reality of his daughter being married, and now he has to come to grips with the fact that she's having a baby. A nice twist on this is that his wife (played by Diane Keaton) is ALSO pregnant, but nevertheless it's still (basically) the same as the first film in one form or another. Thankfully it doesn't seem like a total cash-in (like so many sequels of this sort do) because it has a certain charm (as did the first film) and is still remarkably entertaining, all considered. But you can tell it was made solely because of the success of the first film - even Martin Short is back with another extended cameo as Franz the wedding manager. Of course you may be wondering why he's involved with a pregnancy, since his business is weddings. Here's a hint: more $$$ for the studio. Martin is basically doing the same thing he did in the first film - the weary upper-class guy who feels overwhelmed by the state of things. Diane Keaton is still very sweet and likable as his wife. The rest of the cast (including Macaulay's little brother Kieran Culkin) range from OK to good. Martin Short, however, is yet again a stand-out and is very funny - he wasn't necessary for the plot but he is funny and a good addition to the movie regardless. Overall I'd say this is one of those sequels that didn't need to be made, but could have been a lot worse. It's sweet, it's got some good lite-comedy moments, and in general it's just an enjoyable family movie that isn't trying to be anything other than simple entertainment -- which it is. Like Cliches?; ...That weren't even funny the first time? I've seen a lot of films with Steve Martin in them, and they all made me laugh.  Until this one. Part one is worth a look..it may make you laugh a couple of times (I think I laughed once).  But I recommend avoiding this one all together. Some of Martin's best work!; First, this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2. If run back to back, they run like one beautiful story. This production is great from start to finish. Everything about it is wonderful, including the story, the acting performances and the direction. This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor. His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances. He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man. This movie is no exception. His performance is comedic, yet startlingly genuine. Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's. I love this movie. I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character; with how he feels, and what he's going through. This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum, and I love it. It's less about family, and more about life's curves; the every-day things that make us crazy, happy, sad, and ultimately stronger. It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think, consider, ponder the events which have led us to where we are now. Combined, they rate 8.6/10 from... the Fiend :. I loved it, but one thing bothered me...; I enjoyed this movie: Diane Keaton is my favourite actress, Steve Martin always makes me laugh and Martin Short is great, but I felt really sorry for Keaton having to pretend to be pregnant. She didn't seem to be enjoying it and when the Banks were at the hospital, she actually looked rather bored, because whenever she spoke from the moment George protested about the doctor's name, she almost made it sound like she was in a maths lesson. Apart from that, it was great! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching Martin, Keaton or Short in a movie or who likes to laugh. 9/10 because of the little problem, but it was great. I loved it. Not bad...but could have been better; The first time I saw Father of the Bride 2 I really liked it.  I still enjoy watching some parts of it but I thought some realistic parts in the movie were not necessary.  First of all, the mother and daughter pregnant together.  This could happen but probably when the mother is not older than 40.  Nina had to be at least 47.  Is it likely that the mother would be pregnant at that age? I don't think so.  Secondly, I could not understand why George and Nina wanted the baby to have two last names.  Children always go by their father's last name and I thought Brian's father made a good observation when he said that George and Nina already had Matt to carry on the Banks name.  So why they thought the baby should have two last names is beyond me.  In conclusion, Father of the Bride 2 is still cute and fun to watch in some parts but I thought the first one was much better Not bad, but inferior to the first; I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the first movie. It was not without sentiment and it was hardly original, but it was still beautifully filmed, well acted, charming and funny. This sequel is not as good as the first I agree, but I still quite enjoyed it. The story is predictable, and there are some so-so parts in the script. Eugene Levy, who I do like by the way, is okay here but his character felt somewhat unnecessary and felt like he was there as an additional character and to give the film a longer length. And I also would have liked to have seen more of Kimberley Williams, she is so beautiful and quite a good actress, but I actually do agree that a little too much time is spent between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. However, it is beautifully filmed, has a nice soundtrack, decent pacing and good direction. And the acting is fine too, Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are still very likable, and while as I've said I would have liked to have seen more of her Kimberley Williams was lovely. And I loved Martin Short here too, he was one of the main merits of the first film, so to see him in his wonderfully fluffy turn again was a very nice surprise. Overall, not bad at all, could have been better, but I liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox Funny Sequel; Geogre Banks is getting used to life without his precious daughter Anne. Now he is thinking about all the free time he will have when his son is out of the house.That`s when Anne announces that she is going to have a baby.Geogre is shocked but he becomes even more shocked when he finds out his wife is going to have baby as well.Now he has to deal Franck helping out with the two pregnant women.Can Geogre ever get a break? This is my second favorite movie.My first is Father of the bride part I.This is a good movie.See it it is a great sequel.It is almost as good as the first one. Steve Martin steals the screen. Loved it!!; I thought the sequel to the first Father of the Bride just showed what a great chemistry Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, George Newbern, and Kieran Culkin, along with all the other supporting actors have together. I would actually love to see a Father of the Bride Part III and I usually hate more and more sequels. I really do enjoy this sequel and I think it is better than the first one. I would reccommend any and everyone seeing this movie (but not without seeing the first one). No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. This is my favorite movie; ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is my favorite movie.  I think it is funny, sweet, and truly touches the heart.  In the sequel to the previous, Father of the Bride, George Banks (Steve Martin) is finally getting over the fact that his beloved daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams)has gotten married.  But then she shocks him with the news that she is pregnant.  Everyone else is thrilled, but George is not.  He believes that he is too young to be a grandfather.  He tries to become young, but doesn't succeed.  Then, both he and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton) are shocked to find out that Nina is also pregnant.  George now thinks he is too old to be a father.  They have one other child other then Annie, Matty (Kieren Culkin.)  Through the chaotic turns of pregnancy, George learns to except the fact that his daughter has grown up and moved on, even though it is hard.  They also have to deal with Fronk (Martin Short,) the goofy wedding coordinator from the first movie, who is now designing the new baby's room.  They then discover that Annie has been given the opportunity to design a museaum in Boston, far away from their own, San Marino, California.  George now realizes that he will miss his daughter more then ever, but he learns to get along.  In the end, he enjoys being a grandfather to baby George, and a father again, to Megan, named after the doctor who delievered her.  In this funny and heartwarming sequel, everyone puts out fantastic performences once again.  Even though I very much enjoy Father of the Bride, I enjoy this much more. Very Warm and Funny.; This movie is a very warm and funny family film. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the Sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny. The only thing I didn't like was Eugene Levy's character, I found that his part was just put there to extend the movie a bit. I also didn't like how they used him in the second one when he was clearly the one who auditioned to be the wedding singer in the first one. All in all this is a great family film where many will enjoy and watch together. One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. Worthy second installment.; Mild SPOILERS are contained in the following comments. However, I believe everyone knows the story and how it turns out. The fun of the movie is seeing the actors, especially Martin. Steve Martin is back as George Banks, having just lost his daughter and basketball partner (Kimberly Williams as Annie ) to marriage, and now she is back home with her husband and a big announcement. She is pregnant. Of course everyone is happy, and the joy is doubled when Nina Banks (Diane Keaton as Annie's mom) finds out she is pregnant too. Poor George doesn't know if he can handle all this. After all, he is about to be a grandfather, he's not prepared to be a new father also. Martin Short is back as Franck Eggelhoffer, the unintelligible wedding planner. All ends well as both mom and daughter deliver their babies at the same time, in separate hospital rooms, so George has to go back and forth. The movie ends a few months later, and as Annie and her new baby are leaving, she gives dad a miniature basketball, a reminder to George that he can raise another basketball partner. Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. Better than the original; This one is definitely better than the original, funnier, smoother pace, and in some places, better acting! Plus Martin Short has more screen time. Great! This is a great movie for anyone who like good clean comedy. Awesome! Five out of Five Moose Stars! great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a 10, i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Deja Vu; I found this sequel to be both charming and entertaining. What I learned tonight is that this movie is actually a remake of the 1951 movie \"Father's Little Dividend\", which in turn was the sequel to the original \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and with the same great cast: Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Bennett, et al.  They both share the same broad comedy and story line (only one pregnancy in the earlier version though), and in their own ways are equally entertaining.  Old or new incarnations, however, be sure to see parts one and two in sequence. Average comedy sequel; There's been better, and there's been worse. \"Father of the Bride Part II\" falls right in between when it comes to sequels of comedies. The plot was easily predictable and the movie didn't have as many Steve Martin funny moments as the original. There were some good moments that made me laugh though, most being scenes with Martin Short. It did seem like sort of a stretch, though that all of the sudden \"Frank\" was an interior designer as well as a wedding/baby shower coordinator. I guess they just needed a way to keep him in the movie longer. I was hoping for a lot more when I rented this. My advice: stick to the original. Touching even in its weak state.; Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, and kimberly Williams Paisley return in Father of the Bride Part 2. The film as a sequel was slightly disappointing, but on the whole, likeable. George and Nina Banks are in for the surprise of their lives when they find themselves middleaged and expecting their third child.  The timing is impeccable as Annie Banks-MAckenzie also realizes that she is expecting. Thus Steve MArtin embarks on a nine month journey that will consist of him building a new room for the baby, watching his daughter become a woman and overdosing on sleeping pills.  Honestly, the film made me laugh hysterically and i shed a few tears at the bittersweet ending. 3 and 1/2 stars out of five. Pretty much just a rehash of the first; As this movie started, it reminded me a lot of the first. Various scenes were reenacted, only a little wackier, sort of like it was trying to be a shade more funny than the first; I guess that is the usual stuff for this type of sequels, but I think it failed at that. Apart from that, the movie pretty much succeeds in being a good sequel to the first. The story is also somewhat reminiscent of the first one. All the same actors return as well, and they are pretty much the same, just a shade more wacky. The story is also told by Steve Martins character, George Banks, like in the first. Pretty much everything in the movie is a takeoff of the first; this doesn't make it bad though, if you liked the first, liked the characters, you'll want to see this too, if nothing else, to see the characters again. It is about as funny and as sentimental as the first was, and as enjoyable. Fans of the first one, or of Steve Martin will most likely enjoy at least some part of it, as this is the typical for both the first movie and Steve Martin. 7/10 Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie. A (Rare) Good Sequel; The first \"Father of the Bride\" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin's great comedic \"Dad\" character with the emotions of marrying off his \"only\" (to that point!) daughter. However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor. Thankfully, \"Father of the Bride II\" does not fall into this trap. With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather. Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton). Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women! Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments. Whereas the first film captured George's equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George's identity crisis. With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family. Overall, this film is just as good as the original. The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare. Let's just say that if a \"Grandfather of the Bride\" were in the works, I would be first in line. My comments are going to be very positive.; Hi! I think that Father of the Bride Part 2 was a great film and very hilarious. I think that the mother and daughter could have been pregnant at the same time!  It was a great movie and I recommend it to all people who want a warm-your-heart comedy! It's a great film! Thanks! I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. I really found this film quite annoying; My basic opinion of this movie is that it is a crappy American feel good comedy. It is simply about a man who is going through another mid-life crisis as his daughter, who was married in the first movie, has a baby in this one. The catch is that his wife is also pregnant and with the irony really dripping, both of them have their babies within minutes of each other. As such the kid's auntie is exactly the same age as him (it won't happen to me, though it is possible). When I watch this movie I think to myself, this guy really doesn't have problems. There are people out there that have much more serious problems than he does. He admits to having a beautiful wife who loves him, owns his own home (or did), has a great job and great kids - and he thinks he has problems. Maybe the whole comedy is in the fact that he is worrying about absolutely nothing, but seriously, when I watch this movie, I simply shake my head and think that the guy is a loser. I really don't think it is all that funny. In fact, the guy has much more serious problems. He seems to be spending an awful lot of money, and is going to find himself in a huge amount of debt, and he doesn't seem to ever be at work. My question is not only where he gets his money, but where he gets the collateral for all of the purchases he is making. He buys back his house for an extra $100,000 on top of what he sold it for, and really, how can he seriously afford it. Okay, it wasn't all that bad. As a movie is was made well, and I did chuckle a few times. But in reality, this guy is a serious loser because he has more than anybody could possibly ask for, and he is worried about growing old. Hell, we all grow old, but he has experience more than what a lot of us have already had. Instead of worrying about growing old, the twit should look back on his life and be thankful for the blessings that God has already given him as opposed to forgetting all of that and winging about his age. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late '40's)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... The Best Movie of All Time; let me tell you.. anyone who does not like the movie is just a little close minded.. i read comments that thought the movie was too unrealistic but thats what makes it so great! i mean look at other movies such as lord of the rings or star wars neither or them contain true reality.. this is why its a movie. Anyway, i loved Steve martin in this movie. he does a magnificent job of playing the character for an over protective dramatic father. he was the best actor. who could have played the part of Nina as well as Diane Keaton. she makes the part of the mom annoyingly overwhelming mother, which is exactly what the point of us as the audience to think of her. martin short is the best of all \"fra'nk's\". the way he seeks George banks's approval is perfect. and lastly Kimberly Williams is the gorgeous daughter we are all expecting her to be.. i watch this movie every night before bed and i can recite every word to this movie. because of father of the bride II i have dreamed to meet Steve martin.. \"hes my hero!!\" hopefully you fall in love with it too. and dream to be pregnant with your mother as did Annie banks. Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. 5/10 And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW2, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. daughter gets married; In the sequel to Father of the Bride we have the daughter getting married and moving away from home, this presents a big dilemma to the father played of course by Steve Martin. Maybe not quite as funny as the first one,, or as good,, but definitely above average,, it's always a pleasure watching Steve Martin work at his craft. The movie is basically about how the family,, especially the parents deal with their young daughter growing up,, getting married, and eventually moving away from the nest.. the cameo from Eugene Levy is just wonderful,, as a real estate agent who is trying to sell the very home where our main character lives.. all in all a very family friendly movie,, that I would recommend. Not as good as the first, but still great fun.; In the sequel to the brilliant Father Of The Bride, Nina Banks and her daughter Annie are both pregnant and George Banks, being his usual nervous self has to learn to get used to the idea that he's going to be a father again AND a grandfather. The whole cast including, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams and Martin Short are all back here giving good performances. Even though Father Of The Bride Part II is not as good as the first Father Of The Bride, this is still a great movie which is enjoyable and fun all the way through and that's why I'm going to give this good sequel a 10/10.  Heartwarming &amp; Hilarious; Steve Martin does it again in this touching and funny sequel to 1991's Father Of The Bride the rest of the cast returns in a new story dealing with the joys of parenthood. I loved Father Of The Bride II not only because it was funny, mostly it was due to the comic antics of a man dealing with two pregnancies at once. He's a great comedian as well as an on screen father, my favorite scene is when both babies arrive at the same time. A year has passed since George Banks (Martin) watched his only daughter Annie (Williams) get married and has accepted her transformation from daughter to wife. She comes home with her husband Brian (Newbern) to announce the wonderful news to her parents, brother Matty (Culkin) and in-laws that she's pregnant. Everyone is thrilled and excited except for George who thinks he's too young to be a grandpa, from then on he tries to act young by dying his hair and exercising. But things are about to get a little crazy when his loving wife Nina (Keaton)discovers she's pregnant too now George must deal with the impending arrival of both his grandchild and his own child. Thrown into the chaos is Franck Eggelhoffer (Short) the wedding coordinator who helps to design a room for the new addition to the Banks family. This movie is not only sweet but it's charming entertainment for fans of all ages. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the 1951 sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of 50. This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! Father of the Bride Part II; The first film was the remake of the original version starring Spencer Tracy and Dame Elizabeth Taylor, and it became very popular, so naturally they felt like a sequel was needed to continue the story. Basically George Banks (Golden Globe nominated Steve Martin) is getting used to the fact that his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) has become the bride now wife and got married to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), and more surprisingly a mother when she reveals she is pregnant. With this revelation comes out George has a small midlife crisis, and he tries to recapture his youth, including dying his hair, but he does eventually settle somewhat and get used to the idea that he will be a grandfather. But then he is shocked to find out he will be a father again as well when his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) reveals that she is also pregnant, and it may appear that both her and Annie's baby will be born on the same day. With these things happening, and the house having leaks and termites there is the opportunity to change things by selling the house to Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy), but he changes his mind later. When George manages to get the house back, despite a higher price, he gets the help of camp wedding planner/coordinator, now interior designer, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) to make the baby rooms and get things ready for the arrival of children. There are a couple of false alarms from Annie where she thinks the baby is coming, but eventually it comes to the real thing, and they rush to hospital, and of course Nina goes in to labour as well. In the end George is very happy to be holding both his new baby son and his new baby granddaughter is his arms, before his daughter and her husband move away to their own new home. Also starring Kieran Culkin as Matty Banks, B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein, Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie and Jane Adams as Dr. Megan Eisenberg. I can see what the critics mean by giving it two out of five stars in certain places, it certainly isn't as funny as the original film, it concentrates more on the sentimental material, but that's not a bad thing for this comedy drama. Okay! A really likable comedy.; I enjoyed this film. I found that it was easy to relate to Steve Martin's character George Banks as a parent. The relationship between him and his daughter Annie, played by Kimberly Williams, was an honest father daughter relationship. I recommend this one for parents in general and empty nesters in particular. The idea of a mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time is plausible and amusing. like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $15k bonus to move out in 10 days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $100k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. Father of the Bride II; Likable, but not as impressive a follow up to the 1991 hit with Martin now dealing with his daughter being pregnant...And, oh yeah...his wife is pregnant again too. good, but a mistake; this movie rocks. but there is one thing weird. okay, so in the beginning Annie says, \"i have lived here since i was 5!\" and then later right when they are selling the house and playing basketball Annie and George(her dad) and her dad says \"i remember the first time we played out here, you were 4.\" wait...so was she 4 or 5 when they moved in??????????? other than that this movie makes me laugh, cry(because i laugh so much), and..........uh.....what was that other thing people say when they say that? i don't really remember. i just love how Steve martin always is so cheap. I am forced to say more so i will say i love that this movie is always on HBO! And i realized something, Steve martin has had white hair like forever! Not as good as the first, but good family fun; This movie is as thin as you can get. Its' emotions are easily played. There are no surprises. It is very predictable. And I say...so what? What is wrong with that? This is an American Dream movie. Everything goes perfectly and everyone is as happy as can be. Why should it be a complicated character study? It deals with the birth of babies. There's no complex feelings that need to be dealt with in this situation. A life is being created. A family is being blessed. A baby's birth is a time for love and hope. This movie has both in spades. It's a very positive movie that shows the joy a new baby brings. Every parent-to-be should watch it. A child's birth is an emotional event with no equal. This movie knows it and milks it for all its' worth. My only complaint is it should have been called Parents of the Bride. Way too much time is spent with the relationship between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. There should have been more attention paid to Kimberly Williams. Not only were the scenes between her and Martin the best scenes in this and the original, but Kimberly Williams is the most beautiful actress to come out of Hollywood in many years. Forget all the blond, silicone filled, bimbos that every teenage boy raves about. Ms. Williams is a natural beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****. Better than the first one!; I love Steve Martin, but I was disappointed by the first movie, so I wasn't expecting as much from this one.  But to my surprise, this one was even better! It's constantly funny, just like one should expect from Steve Martin; it's not preoccupied with corny emotion, like the first movie was. It's Steve Martin in his best performance since \"My Blue Heaven.\" Sometimes sequels can be surprisingly good.  This one is better.  It has all the comedic elements that were stagnant in the first movie.  It's everything the first movie should have been, and more! As I understand it, there were accusations of anti-Arab stereotyping?; \"Father of the Bride II\" may seem to some people like a lesser Steve Martin movie, with him as the patriarch from the previous movie now having to deal with his daughter's and wife's pregnancies. Unpretentiously silly. But one interesting thing is that apparently, some Arab groups claimed that the movie was making anti-Arab stereotypes, as a Middle Eastern man buys their house with plans to demolish it. I wouldn't have interpreted that as anti-Arab; I mean, it's not like they're portraying him as a terrorist. Oh well, life goes on. The movie's a nice, goofy way to pass time. I really liked the scene where they bring Steve Martin into the hospital (that would've sure been an embarrassment!). Also starring Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, B.D. Wong and Eugene Levy. Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video Good, but first one was better; This film is good but you have to suspend disbelief quite a few times. All the performances are fine, with Steve Martin a scream again, and Diane Keaton glowing from start to finish (she has a lot more to do here than in FOTB1). The best scenes are: George trying to get buff in the gym, asking which famous men he's younger than, pointing to his wedding ring at the lady in the car next to him, and seeing all the misbehaving children out the window in his car while his wife sees all the happy kids and their parents out her window. And of course, when George holds his child and grandchild outside the delivery room. My favorite line: \"Now going to the movies will be economical: one child, two seniors, thanks!\" Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Good; This is well worth seeing. Everything goes perfectly. Ain't no such thing as too much Steve Martin, baby. Here Martin carries weak material, but it's a positive movie that shows the joy a new child brings. You will laugh, cry and cheer. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Some of the dialog is a bit lost on US audiences, but still some hilarious lines. The music is amazing throughout. Also the scenery is incredible. I saw the cast had a lot of great comedians, so I thought there would at least be a few laughs. Instead, I was surprised to see a very touching movie, absolutely great script. I give it 7 out of 10. AWESOME!; This movie is great!  I think it's one of the best movies ever made!  I love both Father of the Bride I and II!  I think that it is cute how they have the mother and daughter pregnant at the same time!  I hope that they come out with a Father of the Bride Part III, that would be awesome! :-) Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. 2.5 out of 5 stars. Good, so long as you don't try to think too much; It was a fun movie, but it had no particular substance. I mostly watched it because I'd seen the first one. And because it was free on my cable. Or at least, I wasn't paying only to see it. Now, I have done that before and been pleasantly surprised, but this just wasn't one of those movies. Most of what was in this movie has been done already in the first film, and then it was in a much better way. Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, I'm just glad that I got to watch it free. Sure, Steve Martin's always fun to watch, particularly when he's acting dopey for whatever reason, but that didn't make it a great film. Just mediocre. Still, it's fun for a laugh. A Well-Done Sequel!; A sequel to immensely likable Father of the Bride, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is A Well-Done Sequel! Its enjoyable as well as emotional! 'Father of the Bride Part II' Synopsis: George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. 'Father of the Bride Part II' is worthy sequel of a wonderful prequel. The characters still appeal, the humor works &amp; the emotional moments are heartfelt as well. Nancy Meyers &amp; Charles Shyer's Screenplay is genuinely well-done. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography &amp; Editing are fair. Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains. On the whole, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is a satisfying sequel. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the 1951 movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the 1950 classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the 4 year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. A so so sequel; 'Father of the bride' was a good film and probably didn't need a sequel. But this is Hollywood, everything needs a sequel. While it is clear that a lot of effort has gone into making this sequel work, the central idea stretches credibility and every idea the writer had seems to have been thrown at the wall in a desperate attempt to get laughs. There are moments that remind you of the heart and humour that the preceding film had, but it's a load of nothing really. I went into this film dubious about how good it could be, and I didn't finish watching it any more convinced that the original needed a sequel. \"Father 2\" : Born again.; Okay,now the sequel \"Father Of The Bride 2\",which was surprisingly better than expected. Like anyone who sees a sequel,you expect almost a carbon copy of the first. It does start similar to the first movie,with George sitting in a chair addressing us,the audience. It also does an unfortunate repeat of the fight between Annie &amp; Bryan,again like the first movie,I saw it coming. The baby shower party is not played big,like the first after wedding party but I laughed when actual storks carrying little bundles showed up. I was kind of \"iffy\" on the sub-plot of George selling the house,having to leave in ten days and then blowing a bundle to get it back again. I'm not questioning the probability (we know in reality that'd be impossible),I just found it kind of unnecessary. I did however like his dyed hair and new look,that was hilarious and he should have kept it until the end of the movie. Some may say the idea of a mother &amp; daughter being pregnant at the same time,is impossible. Yet,somehow it works here. It's not just the obvious next step for Annie but for George and his wife too,who thought having babies was way behind them. I love Steve Martin's warped expression when Bryan calls him a \"Grandfather\"! I liked that a woman having a baby in her 40's was taken very seriously,since it's a fact that women who have babies later in life have a more difficult time. It makes for a good piece of drama in a film that's otherwise a family comedy. The comedy is helped once again by the presence of Martin Short and I like that he becomes more involved with the family. Especially helping George out the front door on his back. This after giving him sleeping pills for rest. Once the babies are born and Bryan &amp; Annie head to Boston for a new life,the film gets a very touching ending with George and his new baby girl. 8 out of 10 for the expected repeat of ideas,otherwise a very well made sequel. (END) Fantastic; Both the first movie and this sequel are fantastic. I loved the first movie, so I thought I would give the second one a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised!! The acting from all the characters is amazing, from Steve Martin to Diane Keaton to Kimberly Williams-Paisley. 16 years after its release this movie is still a gem. When I'm feeling down or just need a go-to comedy for a night in, these two movies are the best. For those who say that a 40-something woman is too old to have a baby--that's just not true. Do your research. I bet more people have been in that situation than you think. Anyway, this is a feel-good movie for some great laughs and a few happy tears! Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in 1995. It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. not bad for a sequel; as sequels go,this is film isn't too bad.i didn't think ti was quite as good as the first one,but it's not a bad effort.i didn't find it as funny,and some of Steve Martin's histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me.really,this one doesn't quite have the same sincerity as the first.through much of this movie,i was all too aware i was watching a movie,whereas with firs tone,i was drawn in,and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting.having said that,there are some bright spots.for,one,this movie is just as touching as the first.and Eugene levy has a great cameo.and there is still some fun to be had.even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above,i still think Father of the Bride II is a 7/10 Not exactly the most innovative of films, but still great fun!; This is an excellent, funny, warming film. Although a lot of the \"same kind of thing\" was done in the first movie, it's still entertaining. Steve Martin's character was good, although at times his behaviour is quite pathetic and Martin Short is again entertaining. (Particularly his pronunciation of the word 'pregnant).' Although it's highly predictable and not the most intellectually stimulating of films it is still well worth watching and the vast majority of people would enjoy this film. What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Father of the Bride Part II; The 1991 Steve Martin comedy proved out to be popular enough to earn a sequel, much like the original Father of the Bride of 1950. All of the main cast of the first film returns in a story where the eponymous father George Banks (Martin) has gotten over the stressful wedding of his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) and her fiancé Bryan (George Newbern). However, when she breaks the big news about her pregnancy to the family, the grandpa-to-be becomes anxious about getting older and starts proving his youthfulness in various ways, such as selling the family's beloved house to a greedy real estate developer Habib (Eugene Levy). Life has more in store for George and his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) though, as it soon turns out that Annie's is not the only pregnancy in the family. Again, the humour is best when it relies on Steve Martin's comical talent and charisma instead of craziness and exaggeration. Unfortunately, adhering to the rule of always making sequels bigger and louder, the writers have given more screen time to the unbelievably annoying wedding planner Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) whose noisy and flamboyant scenes are certainly the weakest parts of the whole movie. The fussy bumbling caused by the impending childbirths at the end is also rather annoying and unimaginative. I think the movie works best during the more subtle scenes, such as Martin making uncomfortable faces while hiding his nervousness or arguing about the baby's surname with the overjoyed family during a dinner. Besides the run-of-the-mill jokes, the movie also shamelessly wallows in impenetrable sentimentalism of the newborns' adorability. Especially the music is so unbelievably schmaltzy that it was really getting on my nerves while watching; can't the filmmakers just trust their material's appeal without burying it under a sweety-tweety sugar mountain? Nevertheless, despite the predictability of the plot and the not-so-hilarious jokes, George Banks is a very likable character and Steve Martin is at home in the role, so those who enjoyed the first movie will probably like this one too  the basic building blocks of the story have not been changed at all.</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Playmates; The original meaning of a playmate that is of course. Pixar is inventive, Pixar does great movies. Well, you've heard and hopefully have seen it before. But if you have not watched a movie by Pixar yet, you are in for a treat. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy the movies they do. But they work as family movies, kids movies or just \"plain\" movies. It is only a matter of time until Pixar will win an Oscar. Not for animated picture (they've done that and will be doing it for many years to come), but for Best Picture (period)! Toy Story is a ... well story-fantasy that many kids have while they grow up. And to see that come to life (no pun intended), is just great. Especially because Pixar equally has treats for kids and grown-ups alike. You'd have to be a cynic to not like it, I guess. But if you do not have an aversion against animated pictures, you have to check this one out Came at a time when cgi was not doing well and changed the film industry; The plot is Woody, Hanks, a cowboy toy who is Andy's favorite toy but when Andy goes away, the toys come alive and are concerned because Andy's birthday is coming up and they are wondering who will be replaced. Woody is there to calm everyone down because he is Andy's favorite. Until a new toy called Buzz, Allen, shows up with all the latest in toy technology. Woody tries to fight for attention but thanks to this, they both get lost. The rest of the film is them trying to get back to Andy before he moves. The strength of this movie is the writing and these characters are amazingly written and are put in a great concept. There is only jealousy as the villain and this leads to great comedy. In my opinion, some of the best forms of comedy are made from competition and seeing these two characters trying to do the right thing and just being consumed by jealousy is great to watch. It was also clever and interesting. The film doesn't really have a villain. OK, maybe Sid, who loves to blow up toys, and you either knew this kid or was this kid when growing up. However, even Sid is just trying to have fun. So, he can't really be called a villain. That is why the writers are so good. They make everyone identifiable. The idea of toys coming to life is nothing new, we have seen it before but they put this wonderful little spin on it which just works. The CGI holds up pretty well. Sometimes. The plastic texture make it seem pretty decent but they needed to put more time into the humans because they look more plastic than the toys. That is just nitpicking. The film is still unbelievably good. The throw all their talent and all their effort into this movie. Especially in the writing and the characters, thus making it an animated classic. One that films try to copy even to this day. But this would be the first great success for pixar and the animated CG revolution had just begun. Wonderful Film One of Pixar's Best; I love animated Disney films, although I must say I usually prefer the original classic hand drawn Disney films, at some point we have to accept change, and what better way to accept this change with a wonderful superb film. (I mean common they booked Toy Story 4 already). Toy's come to life when their owner is asleep, and its all about the battle for who is the best and most popular toy. Whenever Christmas or the little boy's birthday come around the toys get nervous that they will be abandoned or replaced. When a new toy arrives they are determined to hate him and ignore him, but they end up becoming friends. Greatest animation film ever; Toy Story was the first full-length children's feature made entirely with computer-generated animation, and it was released in 1995. This film has an amazing plot, with great characters and actress which makes Toy Story the greatest animation film ever. Toy story is a buddy movie/adventure tale with an understated lesson about the value of friendship. \"You can count on me!\" Toy Story was about two toys, an old, beloved cowboy named woody (voice of Tom Hanks) and new beloved space ranger, named Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen). Both of these toys try and compete for the love of the human boy named Andy Davis (voice of John Morris) who plays with them, not knowing that they come alive when he lives the room. Toy Story takes place in Andy's bedroom where Woody is always placed on the bed and the rest of the toys are placed in the chest or on the shelves. One day the toys found out that Andy was having a birthday party and became scared that they might be replaced with newer toys. Woody the leader of the toys, calms the other toys down and sends a team of toy soldiers down stairs to scope out the new coming toys. As Andy is opening his gifts the most alarming arrival was brought to the scene when the new comer Buzz Lightyear was opened. Andy fell in love with Buzz Lightyear and ran up stairs and threw Woody off of the bed and replaced Buzz Lightyear in Woody's place. In the first half of the movie Woody and Buzz didn't get along and fought for the love of Andy and the other toys. As the plot takes a different direction when the family decides to move, Woody and Buzz find themselves stuck at the gas station with no idea on how to get home. This is where the theme of friendship takes over in the film. As Woody and Buzz starts to work together to find their way home Sin, Andy's next door neighbor picks them up. As the toys are placed in Sin's room they see Sin feed other toys to his dog. This is when Woody and Buzz join forces and try to escape the house before Sin feeds them to his the dog. Toy Story remains me of Avatar with the use of the computer- generated imagery. Like Toy Story, Avatar brought the characters to life with the use of all the different colors schemes, lighting and angles. Both of these films characters looked very human like and real and both won rewards for their use of animation. Sparkling family entertainment; Disney/Pixar initiated a new sophisticated form of animation with the 1995 box office smash Toy Story, a richly entertaining and imaginative animated adventure that not only spawned two sequels, but became a merchandising dream. The film opens in the bedroom of a little boy named Andy who is moving in a couple of days. The central characters are Andy's toys, who are led by a cowboy action figure named Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), who is apparently Andy's favorite toy. Woody and the other toys feel seriously threatened when Andy receives a space action figure called Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) for his birthday. Immediate antagonism materializes between Woody and Buzz when Woody feels he might be replaced in Andy's heart, but Woody and Buzz are forced to bond and actually become friends when they become prisoners of Andy's next door neighbor, Sid, a sadistic little kid who likes to torture toys. This deliciously imaginative story works thanks to a brilliant screenplay that brings vivid and believable emotions to toys, effectively showcasing the world from a toy's point of view. The jealousy and resentment between Woody and Buzz rings completely true and is actually the glue that keeps this story moving. Though the story provides consistent laughs, there are a couple of poignant moments as well...watch when Andy stops sleeping with Woody, who gets demoted from Andy's bed to the toy box or watch when Buzz sees a commercial for himself and finally realizes that he is a toy and is not real. As always with Disney animated films, the voice casting is perfection, with standout work from Hanks, whose work here rivals the voice work of Robin Williams in Aladdin...he makes us love and care for Woody and puts us in his corner from jump. Mention should also be made of Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Jim Varney as the Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as a very insecure toy dinosaur, John Ratzenberger as a piggy bank named Ham, and R. Lee Ermey as a toy soldier. Really liked Annie Potts as a Little Bo Peep doll too, though I just couldn't get past my trouble with the fact that a little boy would own a Little Bo Peep doll, but I did not allow this to deter my enjoyment here. Randy Newman contributed a couple of nice songs to the film, one of which, \"You've Got a Friend\", received an Oscar nomination. John Lasseter's direction and his contribution to the Oscar nominated screenplay are the final touches to this entertaining adventure that actually conjured up images of Spielberg work like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future, and though the story does have a couple of extra endings, it is a richly entertaining fantasy adventure that had me laughing and smiling throughout the entire running time. It was a beautiful movie!; I bought a 10th anniversary special edition of Toy Story a few years back when I was 8 or 9 years old. That was how I was first introduced to Toy Story. The movie was very touching and emotional. Listening to the developers' talking about how they made the movie and hearing the various reviews from many people about Toy Story was nice. I loved how Andy (and don't forget Buzz) never gave up throughout the movie, acting like most people in the world generally do (showing that toys are much like us), whether for the good or bad. I liked how the both helped each other and worked together in the movie. It was a great experience and I recommend that you who haven't watched it should. In the end, both realized their mistakes, admitted them and changed to become better persons. Sorry, toys. Good and groundbreaking; Good and groundbreaking computer animation graphics movie that delivers but does not reach a higher level due to the animation itself not having the \"warmth\" of the drawing style classic Disney animations.Still,the computer style here is very promising and quite impressive.Good story and script.A good solid start in a new trend in animation production.Very good voice acting.Only for fans of kids movies..... The greatest animation ever made.; This film amazed me it has one of the greatest scripts ever made it's lines are among the most memorable even though the two stars never met each other while filming was taking place and it brings together a fantastic cast including Tim Allen and Tom Hanks and an amazing supporting cast. The animation is completely perfect and the fact that it doesn't let itself be rolled into Disney Schmaltz too bad is another plus. a fantastic film with an unbelievably great script a real masterpiece and a great role model for other films too follow and a fantastic start for that studios career which has also continued with Monsters Inc and A bugs life if you haven't already got it go out and buy it. 5 out of 5 stars One of the Top Ten Movies of the 1990s; If there's any justice in this crazy world of ours, \"Toy Story\" will become a classic in the mode of \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Snow White.\" I look forward to its appearing every year on television, as a much anticipated \"event.\" It certainly is groundbreaking, what with imagery that must've taken a computer system dwarfing the pentagon's to do. But I love how well-thought-out this movie is. The plot works from beginning to end. The performances are terrific--Tom Hanks and Tim Allen don't just blather their lines onto the soundtrack, leaving it for the animators to do all the work. No, rather, they're really *acting* here, imbuing their characters with as much depth and breadth as if they'd been playing flesh-and-blood people. Keep a sharp eye, movie lovers, inside gags abound: When Woody runs from an escaped globe, you'll think it looks just like the giant ball sequence from \"Raiders,\" and you'll be right! When Buzz walks amid a sea of tiny alien squeak-toys, Richard Dreyfuss' close encounter \"...of the Third Kind,\" of course, should echo in your mind. The look of the movie *is* stunning--and, IMO, it \"works\" in every instance but one: Syd's dog. Instead of looking canine, he looks instead like a fur-covered football. I wish Pixar had spent a few more pixels refining his \"look.\" But all that's quibbling. Here's a movie for every kid who whiled away an afternoon while sprawled in front of a toy box and for every adult who ever wondered what happens to those Little Tykes people once you turn off the lights and go to bed... A resounding success; Pixar knocks it out of the park with its first feature film, about friendship, jealousy and the capriciousness of privileged white kids in a society of disposability. A clever, sharp and imaginative screenplay expertly voiced by a stellar cast (I would give this 5/10 just for casting Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head) keeps the swiftly moving story engaging throughout, flagging only a bit when self- deluded toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is briefly depressed. The film hops from one great set-piece to the next with head-spinning speed that leaves me marveling at how simple director John Lasseter and the team of animators make it look to bring these toys to life with just a few touches of individuality. Every viewer will probably have their favorite parts. Back when I first saw the movie upon its initial release, mine was the new-age toys who worship the Claw; upon recent viewing, I think it is \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" rendition of evil neighbor Sid's bedroom. It's hard to remember now that Pixar has proved so successful that there was real doubt about whether its style of computer-graphics animation would be embraced by audiences -- kudos to Pixar for proving the doubters wrong. Toy Story 1; I have to give Toy Story 1 an 8 b/c even though I am a grown adult, I love all types of Disney movies but this one nearly tops the charts. Toy Story 2 on the other hand gets a 2, it was the most boring movie there ever was... actually kind of depressing to. Granted Toy Story 1 was extremely good it's just not a movie they should have came out with a sequel to. I am currently searching for pictures (scenes) from the movie because of my screen name I would like to find pictures of buzz with the pink hat on portraying Misses Nesbit. If anyone has these pictures could you please reply? I also believe that Toy Story 1 was the best movie because of the cool graphic's. I think that Disney done an exceptional job on the movie in parts where the Pizza Planet scene was taken because of the reality of the crane machine and the little green aliens. Also the kids in the scenes looked very real to, even though I think the mother of Andy had way to much animation in it. fun; I love the movie toy story because it is fun and a good movie. I love the movie because woody found out there was going to be another toy for Andy and he was getting jealous. When woody saw the new toy he was really jealous because the other toys likes buzz and not woody. Woody wanted to get rid of buzz but getting to the end he regrets what he did to buzz and he went to save buzz and wanted to be friends with him. When the other toys ask for buzz woody always had an excuse and his friends found out that he wanted to rid of buzz so all his friends was really mad at buzz. His friends tried to find buzz. They found buzz in a pizza place where they had arcades and other stuff. When they found buzz woody apologized buzz and he wanted to be friends and be OK with everything. This Movie is Great!!; Toy Story was the best Pixar movie i ever watched! It has a good start where Andy has a birthday with his favourite toy: Woody. And Andy's Mom says \"Go Get Molly, the party is about to start!\" So Andy runs to his Room to get Molly. Woody realized he was not Andy's favourite toy anymore, So Woody wants to be Andy's favourite toy again! Woody had to find a way to knock Buzz out of the house, And Andy bringing Woody to Pizza Planet! So Woody was fighting Buzz, He realized he was a lost toy. So Woody Found A Pizza Car with a Spaceship on the top! So Buzz finds a Spaceship Claw Machine. Buzz found Alien toys in the Machine! The Aliens found The Claw! So Sid tries to get Buzz, But he got double prizes!! The Ending was great!! The ending had Andy moving in a new house, Then getting new stuff for Christmas, Then Woody And Buzz seemed happy at each other! rather clever; Great Pixar movie. I love the idea and the point to this animated feature. It's so good in so many ways. I remember it came out in theaters when I was three and wanted to see it so badly I couldn't sleep for weeks. This movie has been out for over ten years and I still enjoy it today as a teenager. It's great for all ages and brings so many laughs to a lot of young and older people. I especially love the part when Buzz Lightyear is in denial and thinks he is Mrs. Nizbet. That was SOOOOOOOOO funny!!!!!!!!! LMAO!!!!!!!!!! This movie is always going to be remembered for so long. Even the sequel was really good. I'm gonna have to post a comment on that on too. Anyways great movie. Loud laughs for everyone. My Favorite Animated Film EVER; I love Toy Story. Plain and simple, it's a phenomenal film. Not only is it one of the most well-made animated films ever made, it's also one of my favorite films in general. It's incredibly appealing story, the voice acting is perfect, the characters are very likable and fun to watch on screen, and the animation is stellar for it's time. The basic premise of TOY STORY is life seen through the eyes of a toy. The film centers around the toys belonging to a boy named Andy, particularly following his favorite toy, a stuffed cowboy doll named Woody. Woody is primarily the one in charge of Andy's room, but his authority is threatened when Andy gets a new spaceman toy named Buzz Lightyear. The only problem is that Buzz doesn't know he's a toy. He genuinely thinks that he is a real space ranger. Tom Hanks voices Woody and Tim Allen voices Buzz, and both do a stellar job. I couldn't ever imagine anybody voicing these two characters besides Hanks and Allen. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well, such as Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, and others. The characters are so fun to watch, and you truly care about them as you watch Woody and Buzz form a friendship. At it's heart, Toy Story is a buddy movie, and one of the best made at that. While the animation seems somewhat dated today when compared to PIXAR's more recent films, the film does still look very nice. Looking back at the film, it truly is a technological achievement as well as a film-making achievement in general. Being the first animated film done entirely through computers, Toy Story had a lot of expectations to meet. And not only does it meet expectations, it surpasses them to infinity and beyond. This Is A Great Family Movie; Imagine a world where whenever your back is turned or whenever you leave a room your toys come to life and communicate with each other like we do. Woody is the toy cowboy doll of a boy called Andy. Woody is Andys favorite toy until one day Andys birthday comes around and he gets a new toy which quickly becomes Andys favourite toy ahead of Woody. Woody quickly becomes jealous because not only has Andy pushed him aside but his fellow toy friends have chosen the new toy Buzz Lightyear ahead of Woody so now Woody plots a way to get Buzz out of the way for good with disastrous consequences. I will say no more about the movie as i feel if you haven't seen it then most of this film should be a surprise to you. All i do have to say however is Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz are superb choices as the voices of the main characters. This is an incredibly warm hearted and fun family film that a child of any age would love. Wonderful animated feature...; TOY STORY is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. It goes along with TOY STORY 2, TARZAN, A BUG'S LIFE, THE LION KING and CHICKEN RUN as some of my favorite animated features. Tom Hank s voices Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll owned by a boy named Andy who is the most-played toy until a space ranger, Buzz (Tim Allen) comes along and Woody is not good friends with them. But one day later, a mean toy-hating man who owns a collection of mutant toys and tries to threaten Buzz, and it is up to Woody to save Buzz with the help of the mutants before it's too late to escape to Andy's new house. The sequel is better than the original, but TOY STORY is a good movie. **** Cool A MUST see; I saw this movie when i was 5 years old a long time ago and I was so obsessed with Buzz Lightyear! I had toys of buzz Lightyear and carried them around anywhere i went.I saw this movie yesterday again and it was fabulous! plain fabulous. The story was amazing and the characters were well made! Nice job Pixar, You done it again! Tom Hanks did well doing a voice of Woody and same with Tim Allen with Buzz. I didn't really like Wall.E i almost fell asleep but this movie kept me awake the whole time with excitement! I recommend this movie to anyone no matter what age you are because this movie Just Beautiful! An fantastic awesome 10/10 The recent 3-D version of Toy Story just adds to a great experience!; When this initial computer animated movie first came out in November of 1995, I was stoked to watch this especially after watching a little behind the scenes short about it at Walt Disney World and besides, my birthday was near. What a wonderful experience what with the funny moments as well as touching ones and some intense ones concerning that sadistic kid Sid. And the use of many established comic talents like Don Rickles, Annie Potts, John Ratzenberger (who would become a regular Pixar voice), the late Jim Varney, and especially, Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. And as with previous Disney animated features, Randy Newman provides such an enjoyably compelling music score as well as several enjoyable songs with a great theme song in \"You've Got a Friend in Me\" that he warbled with Lyle Lovett. And the recent 3-D version just adds to the experience! So while this and Toy Story 2 is still (in its fourth week) playing as a double feature in theatres (with an entertaining 10-minute intermission of trivia and many other extras), I recommend you rush to the next showing as soon as you can! Greatest childhood memory; This movie reminds me of my childhood. I used to watch this movie almost everyday. This is great for kids and adults as well. I remember my whole family watching this movie. We used to sit together by the t.v. and have some quality family time. That was around the time when everyone seemed so busy with their lives. But this movie brought us all together. We were able to let go of everything and watch this movie. I show this to my baby brother and he loves this series. Whenever I hear the theme song I am brought back to the time of family bonding. When everybody had time for this particular movie. I still enjoy watching this movie at this age. I gave it a ten because it has helped me through so many times, it has been there through so many problems. I loved this movie and would recommend this movie to everyone. This review is to honor the movie the way it deserves to be honored. *This review has been stretched and has been dramatized to make the 10 line requirement. Just know that I really love the movie. That's about it* One of the best children's (and adult!) Disney animation ever created.; Toy Story is and will always be one of the best children's and adult's Disney animation ever created. As a parent, you dread seeing the same animated movies over and over again (kids never get bored seeing the same movie many times), but this one is different. I've lost track how many times I've seen it and it's just as enjoyable as the first time I saw it. Tom Hanks' voice is perfect for Woody, as is Tim Allen's as Buzz Lightyear and Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head. Love this movie and I don't think I will ever get bored seeing it. It's a perfect 10/10 from me. One of the Best Animated Films Ever!; Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen.  The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer.  The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen.  The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year).  Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with. The masterpiece that started it all; I remember seeing Toy Story opening night in 1995. 5 years have passed since then, and this movie is still awesome. I have matured in those years, but this film has not lost it's impact. It's so addictive to watch and so much fun. It has a wonderful voice cast, great animation, and an overall great story. It's a film I will watch for years, and it's one of my favorite modern animation films When toys attack.. or have fun.. or escape..; A classic. I enjoyed this, and the actual toys of Buzz when I was younger, and now I just rewatched the movie and I'm very glad that I did. Weird, it's almost Halloween, and this is far from horror. Anywho, this is one of the films that got people to know, There's a company named Pixar and they're going to rock the world of film and animation as you know it. This movie could be one of Pixar's best. Andy is moving and his toys are coming with him. But he gets a new toy for his birthday, but a week before since he wants to have his party before he move. His new toy.. Buzz Lightyear! And Woody is jealous because he could not be the favorite toy. But before you know it, Woody is lost on the way to a Pizza place when he was supposed to be going with Andy, and Buzz is joining on the ride. Now they must get to Andy before he moves.. or while he's moving. Oops, spoiled. A great animation. Really shows you why some choose 3d animation over traditional animation. Hey, you wouldn't want to see toy story as a 2d cartoon? Do you?  This movie was one of the best 3d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an 8.5.(I gave it an 8) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of 3d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! One of the most watchable(& re-watchable) movies ever.; This movie has it all. Simple enough for children to enjoy, and yet with enough subtle humour for adults to enjoy as well. In fact, this film was made more for adults than for children I suspect-much of the humour is subtle and adult oriented, and as the makers admit, many of the toys are ones they played with in their childhoods. The toys in the film are actually better actors, and convey more emotion, than most \"actors\" in films today. Kudos to Pixar for an excellent job. A must-see film, it has something for everyone, and loses nothing on repeated viewing. I saw it 3 times at the cinema, and then bought it on video, and have probably seen it 50 or so times at home, and yet it is still funny, and I will happily watch it again.  My childhood!; I love this film. It has a few flaws. It doesn't look nearly as well as it did upon release. But I'll never forget watching this classic in the cinema. Pixar had a solid group of films dating over a decade (Cars not included), but I can always re-visit. Thanks Pixar for this brilliant premiere of a gem and for: - A Bug's Life - Monsters, Inc. - Toy Story 2 - Finding Nemo - The Incredibles - Ratatouille - WALL-e - Up - Toy Story 3 Yep! a wonderfully innovative movie; truly a delight; Clever, heartwarming story centers around a group of living toys and their perspectives on the world they inhabit, one in which attention from their owner is the essence of their very existence. An old-fashioned cowboy doll and longtime favorite of his child owner is threatened by the arrival of a sophisticated, high-tech space ranger. Despite their differences, they eventually realize that they need each other in order to overcome a dangerous predicament. On the surface it's the first film ever done completely with computer animation, but at its heart is a compelling story of friendship, love, and acceptance. Terrific songs, remarkable animation, and a perfect cast of voices make this an engaging experience for all ages. A family film and so much more. ***½ Toy Story 9/10, Toy Story 3-D 5/10- rip off; Let me explain. I love films. Toy Story is beyond excellent. Toy Story 3-D is perhaps the biggest con since Keyser Soze convinced the world he didn't exist. There is ONE SCENE in the whole film where you actually get the sense of 3-D and that is right at the end during a snow scene. If you have Toy Story on DVD or have seen it before, stay at home because you are seeing nothing new here. The thing that annoys me is that in addition to paying to see the same film that I own on DVD, I paid extra for 3-D glasses!! unbelievable!! it should've been a highway mans mask and a club. I implore you to stay away from this and Toy Story 2 3-D when it is out as I am sure they will just do the same again. Hands Down My Favorite Disney FIlm.; I just recently saw the Toy Story, Toy Story 2 double feature and it was amazing seeing this movie on the big screen after all this time. In my opinion this is the best movie Pixar has made so far, and it will be hard to top it. The animation is flawless and all of the characters are so lovable, you actually forgot that they are toys and not real people. The plot is actually really inventive and the idea of toys being jealous of one another is really fun. I think this movie is perfect for people of any age because the humor can be enjoyed by anyone. Obviously it's the perfect movie for kids, but it's great for adults too. Tim Allen and Tom Hanks lend their voices as the main characters in this film, and they are perfect in it. Overall, this movie is genuine animated classic! Created a decade ago, but still stunning; I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago. The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their \"leader\" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other... When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10. Hanks and Allen are hilarious even animated!; As if Tom Hanks wasn't talented enough...someone had the brilliant idea to animate him! Not to mention pair Hanks great sense of humor with comedic genius Tim Allen! Together, these two keep the giggles and laughs coming in this cute and successful Disney Pixar flick that spawned an even cuter sequal! Best Animated Film Ever!!!!; This is one of the best animated films I ever seen! It will always be better than the other two Toy Story films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are so good in the Toy Story franchise. Woody's sarcasm is the best part of the film as well as Buzz not knowing he's a toy. The story of this film is just something you wouldn't expect but then it is about toys, so it all makes sense. I will always recommend this film and the rest of the franchise to friends and family. To Infinity and Beyond! My favorite film as a kid and remains a classic today; As a kid, I remember watching the first two Toy Story films frequently and collecting all the characters from the movie. I found out that it was the very first computer-animated film about two years ago and assumed that's why the movie is still so popular. Woody and Buzz are what made the film what it was then and today and were my favorite characters. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is where Woody and Buzz are launched in the air from the rocket and Buzz frees himself to fly into Andy's toy box. The film remains a classic and always will be to me. I also cannot wait for the third movie to come out June 18, 2010 because I'll be the first in line. The film of a child's dream; All I can say is that I started my childhood with this film. And I can remember that my hole day i was thinking of the film in the clouds I could picture the film, in my dream i kept thinking of it. I say that this film completed a kids dream. And in the future I will surly show this film to my kids and if they didn't like it ..... well they must like it!!!! I started to learn English after I sow this film. And every time I remember my childhood and this film I could cry. So I am asking you to watch this movie and please make your kids watch it with you. And I really want a third film for toy story. And thanks for the producers for doing two parts of this film. If ever a movie was perfect, this is it.; Never mind that it's a kiddie movie.  It's a pioneer film from Walt Disney and worth seeing just on that merit alone.  The whole concept of the toys lends itself perfectly to the new medium of computer animation, not to mention the incredible marketing of it's toys. The plot and the dialogue keep producing laughter faster than Disney's releases of re-releases.  The end sequence ties in perfect with the open sequence, opening presents.  In fact, the whole concept was so solid, that the movie would have been just as successful if no big names had been cast.  Not that I'm complaining, I'm a fan of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, too.  But when you look  back at all the hoopla of the film, you kind of forget them.  You won't forget Buzz and Woody! Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition); Tom Hanks is an amazing animated movie with a well written script that is about the secret life of toys. The centers around Andy and his toys. Andy has a long time favorite toy named woody. Woody likes his situation till Andy gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear and Woodys situation changes forever, or so it seems to Woody. The animation is astounding considering that it was done over ten years ago (1995). I highly recommend this movie and I consider it one of the best animated made ever. The songs are a bit sappy but perfect for animated movies and the music is right on par. I definitely without a doubt give this movie 5 stars. Toy Story is the greatest Disney movie ever in my opinion! Looking forward to Toy Story 3 in two years!; There is absolutely no question about it, Disney/Pixar's 1995 hit film, Toy Story, is their absolutely best film in my opinion. Pixar, the visual effects studio based in Northern California, was best known for making short films with three dimensional technology, including some Oscar winning shorts. In 1992 a script called Toy Story was completed and Pixar decided to take on the challenge of creating the world's first fully computer animated motion picture. In 1995, that script came to life, and the rest is history. Not only was Toy Story a gigantic hit for Disney and Pixar, it started series of films that continues to amaze and bewilder children and adults of all ages. The animation was state of the art, and continues to look amazing to this day. The characters, Woody, and Buzz Lightyear, to the humor were all amazing. Pixar won a special Oscar for making the first computer animated film, and it led to many more films of it's type to this day. Pixar, don't make us wait, please give millions of children around the world what we desperately need, more adventures of Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Here's to many more Toy Story films in the future, including the upcoming Toy Story 3 coming in three years, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen returning as Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Bona Fide Genius; What can I say that has not been said about this superb piece of work? Pixar have redefined what animation is all about. The concept, the story, the writing and the voice-overs could hardly be bettered. The toys are real individual characters brought to believable life by the actors who voice them. Special mention for Tom Hanks as you really cannot separate his voice from Woody's character. It works on every level. Kids love it, as do teenagers, young adults and pensioners like me too. The songs by Randy Newman are not too intrusive and actually enhance the story and move it on too. The amount of work that must have gone into the brainstorming before production started must have been amazing. It would have been great to have an insight into all that. Everyone should be made to watch this - it has a lot to say about life and relationships. Best computer animated movie of it's time!; This is an all time classic movie. The characters can really hold the your attention. The bright colors are wonderful. There is never a dull moment in this film especially with Woody. The toy characters are so great an funny. I love the banter between Mr & Mrs Potato Head. Buzz Lightyear is also an awesome character who is very courageous! This is a fantastic film I am a really big fan of Tom Hanks! A Toy in the making of another and more toys; Excellent voice match to character in movie. Could have more art and less same images repeat. Pixar is now faster than ever; 1995 a slower speed for animated film. Will watch again, but not over and over again, consecutively. Liked it on Facebook, happy go lucky and not afraid to be bold. Don't understand the likes and dislikes but willing to accept all criticism. My own personal review may be liked or may be disliked. The clearness and accurate manner for beautiful taste in dual role models for example Sid the evil kid whom abuses toys and Andy the kid who doesn't like to play rough. However, Sid's sister is quite an opposite to Sid as well; she being a girl and has a love for tea parties with her closest doll Friends. The jokes and laughter in \"Toy Story\" is what made this turn of a century animated film a door-buster into the the first \"digital\" animated films in history. Of course, one does grow old and the story is great passed on to your children in just about any house hold! this movie is awesome!the humor never bores!; i remember when this movie came out in 1995. i was seven at the time. i have loved it since day 1. actors such as tom hanks and tim allen bring sparkle to the show. they are both hillarious as woody and buzz. this movie is directed at both kids and adults. the humor never goes flat and it is never cheesy or corny. if you are a fan of tom hanks and tim allen or you just want a good laugh, than you shoud definitely watch this movie. you will not regret it. ********** out of **********. Not to be missed!!!!; This is probably the best effort Disney has ever put into a movie and it shows! The animation can not be faulted (I even noticed reflections in polished wood tables when the toys walk across them!) the attention to detail in this digital world was brilliant. The characters were hilarious and I still laugh in all the same places after multiple viewings. It's a movie about friendship and doing the right thing after you make a mistake. A valuable lesson for young children. The jokes for adults are spot on aswell such as the quick \"Blink and you'll miss it\" scene where Mr Potatohead mocks another toy by taking his mouth off and patting his rear end with it. The word \"A##kisser!\" immediately came to mind and I laughed for ages at that alone! It was also subtle enough for young children watching to miss it altogether which shows how cleverly this movie was put together. Can't wait for the sequel! 10/10 even better than Bug's Life (another Disney / Pixar collaboration) and that's high praise indeed!  The one that started it all; Toy Story is a gem of a movie from Pixar that is still as visually impressive today as it was when it was originally released over a decade ago. Computer animation was a new thing at the time but Toy Story proved that the medium was more than a novelty act and was going to be around for a while. Woody (Tom Hanks) is Andy's favorite toy until Buzz Lightyear, a spaceman voiced by Tim Allen, arrives on the scene. To quote Randy Newman's song from the film, strange things begin to happen to Woody when he loses popularity with the other toys and is accused of trying to kill Buzz out of jealousy. Soon things go awry for the toys when Sid, Andy's sadistic neighbor, gets a hold of Woody and Buzz. The toys have to learn to work together and forge an alliance in order to survive. Great story and voice acting all around makes Toy Story a classic. 9 out of 10. Mesmerized..; When I first watched the film, I was in love with movies. This is one of those films that one can watch again and again. All things apart, the most dazzling part of the film are its story. And when you mix it with mind blowing dialog delivery (voice over), then you serve an exceptional beauty for anime lovers. The voice over of woody by Tom hanks is the best that I have ever heard in any animation film. The story is the best in so many of the animation films till today. There is nothing in the film that you might dislike. The toy story series serves the true purpose of films which is to make people forget about their day to day worries. The characters in the film are an absolute delight to watch. Each and every character is designed so nicely with their respective roles that I am in love with the series. The essence of the film is simple and has been conveyed in an easy way. Looking forward for more films like these. \"A must watch for everyone, and especially kids.\" a movie that you will be talking about; this is a movie that you will be talking about i never saw a movie like this ever Toy Story is one amazing movie this is a movie that everyone will be talking about if you like Toy Story 2 and 3 than you you will like the first one it is a laugh out laud movie i never saw a movie like this ever it is outstanding it is a sweet movie go see this amazing movie today i never saw a movie quite like this ever it is like a dream come true this is the perfect family film it is a great movie for the kids to enjoy even if your kids are 13 14 15 16 17 18 or 19 they will still enjoy this amazing movie go see this 4 out of 4 star movie and a two thumbs up movie it is that good of a movie you have to go see Toy Story it is a must see for everyone it is a hoot there is nothing like this movie i am serious there is nothing like this movie it is one of a kind it is the best movie ever created i think so it is hilarious i laugh so hard it was that funny it should be called the number 1 movie in the world have a great day everyone Scmaltz-tastic 3D adventure ride falls a little flat over the years; I just watched Toy Story for only the 3rd time since it was first in the theaters, and as much as I liked a lot of the movie, it fizzles out over time for me. It's a very cute movie, mainly for kids, but it has a few chuckles thrown in for adults. The human characters in the movie didn't seem very realistic; their happy-go-lucky, suburban lifestyle just made them very flat and barely likable, especially if you grew up in a family unable to afford multiple toys. The voice actors were delightful, and their moods were directed very well, even for the plastic Army-men who don't show much emotion. The \"cannibal toys\" were very imaginative and creepy, so they served their purpose well. I thought the idea of the claw machine that housed the little green aliens was cute, how \"The Claw\" was their Messiah of sorts. The coloring in the film was vivid and incorporated some awesome day-glow tones that I had forgotten about over time. The ultimate reason to watch the movie is to witness Pixar's astounding use of 3D imagery, especially when they incorporate real-life effects onto the screen (i.e. The magnifying lens over Woody's face). There were some aspects of the film I didn't care for. The movie is only 77 minutes long without the prefaced, short 3D movie before it, making the story suffer and seem a little lacking. I found the music to be over-the-top schmaltzy and generic, but it is primarily for kids and the Disney crowd, so I guess it belongs here. Again, the character of Andy isn't very likable, other than the fact that he owns a lot of older toys that we made have seen commercials of as a kid. The story wasn't very mind-blowing, but from the vantage point of a toy on the run, it is imaginative enough. It's the typical Indiana Jones setting where the main characters always find a way to turn their two-steps forward into one-step back. The ending with the falling through the sunroof was very convenient and could've easily been the start of another obstacle they needed to face, for example. In the end, I like the movie for its presentation, but as a film, I was not blown away with originality or anything by its story. The messages that it sends about jealousy, envy, depression, fear, and questions about one's worthiness to another are the primary focuses throughout the movie, but it ends up just being another nicely tied-up package in the end, which is Disney for you. 5 stars. Perfect! A badge to be worn proudly by Pixar.; Of course my opinion, but truly,honestly perfect! It is an amazing standalone, kid, and Pixar film with all the great motifs of all. It teaches children good values about who are in the world, and mortality. It also appeals to all ages and has incredible animation for 1995, and also was great enough to be unforgotten all the way until now 2015, 20 years later. Buzz's realization that he is just another product to be sold in the world, is in my opinion, one of the greatest moments of movie and entertainment history. The movie gives you a lot of things to speculate on like is Woody a bad toy? Or can a movie have virtually no villain but the hero or at all? The choice is 100% yours and that is what I love most about the movie. It is absolutely timeless and unforgettable and I highly suggest watching it. Super family movie!; Toy Story is truly a pioneer of this type of movie. I don't know what it's really called but I think digital animation best describes it. From here, you have all the Shrek, etc. derivatives. Not only is the film irresistibly funny it is also has a clever story and unlike many movies of today you can watch this one over and over. The voices are done by a host of popular names that we all know and love. Some of the most popular being Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, and John Ratzenberger as Hamm. Jim Varney even lends his hilarious voice as Slinky the Dog. The story is about a boy (Andy) that gets a new toy (Buzz Lightyear) for his birthday. Andy's previous favorite toy (Woody) feels forgotten. After a series of mis-adventures the two find themselves away from the home and must learn to work together to find their way back. The film is followed by a sequel \"Toy Story 2\" and \"Toy Story 3\" which were just as awesome, if not more so than this one. 9/10 easily The cartoon that started it all.; I am not a kid but a kid at heart. Toy Story is one of the best animated movies around. This is the most creative movie for kids and adults. Toy Story 2 is better story than the first one, but equally imaginative in computer graphics. \"I'm not really from Mattel...I'm from a smaller company purchased in a leveraged buyout.\"; A kid's bedroom full of toys comes to life when humans aren't around; each toy, both new and retro-vintage, has his or her own individual personality, and they're all thrilled to meet the new member of the pack, birthday present Buzz Lightyear, who just may usurp Sheriff Woody in their pre-teen owner's heart. Disney/Pixar computer-generated cartoon has witty writing and incredible visuals to spare, though some scenes are heavy with chatter and the climactic race to catch up to a moving van is stretching things, even for a kid's picture. Still, some of the lines (which fly by at top speed) are very sharp and funny, and the star-voices (particularly Tim Allen's as Buzz) are uncanny. **1/2 from **** Entertaining for all; Cleverly crafted Disney production has plenty to laugh at for both younger and more mature audiences. The innovative idea creates a world in which children's toys come to life in their own universe; the bedroom. While the animation is not exactly state of the art any more, the pic benefits from some jovial, whole-hearted performances. Especially of note is the irrepressible Tom hanks as Woody, Andy's favourite toy (until now), and Tim Allen, hilariously deadpan as space ranger Buzz Lightyear, the new guy in town. The comedy stays fresh and lively throughout while there is always something happening to keep little eyes tuned. Infinitely watchable, as Disney often is. Tuesday, December 1, 1998 - Video Imaginative Breakthrough.; Toy Story (1995): Dir: John Lasseter / Voices: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Jim Varney: Breakthrough first fully computer animated film and what a wondrous triumphant visual thrill it is. It is a film for families that will appeal on different grounds depending on age. It regards a cowboy named Woody and the jealousy that erupts when Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear enters the room on their owner's birthday. Buzz is interesting because he doesn't realize that he is a toy. When Woody causes Buzz to fall out a window an adventure begins that eventually lands them both in nasty Sid's bedroom from next door where a dire fate awaits toys. Grand idea with imaginative filmmaking by director John Lasseter. Where the film goes wrong is its placing supporting characters as types with little purpose. The two leads carry the film with Tom Hanks voicing Woody who goes from important to jealousy to hero in an exciting climax. Tim Allen as Buzz brings much humour in his inability to accept what he is. There is a host of other toys that seem more like fillers. Don Rickles voices Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn voices T-Rex. Jim Varney of Ernest P. Worrell fame voices the loyal Slinky Dog. It contains a theme of love and friendship and for adults it addresses the future of films. Grand achievement, or as the toys put it, \"To infinity and beyond!\" Score: 9 / 10 A fantastic family film.; The plot:A wooden cowboy doll called Woody is a young boy's favourite toy, yet when his owner gets a space toy of an astronaut called Buzz Lightyear, Woody has been left out of his owner's daily live. Woody finds out that Buzz Lightyear thinks that he really is a space ranger.     Both toys are now fighting each other while being kidnaped by the next door nieghbour that hates toys and must work together to get back to their owner before they are destroyed. The view:A wonderful enchanting and nicely funny story about rivally between two toys that are animated very well, with the fact of the movie being the first that was computer animated, this movie is really for everyone that enjoys watching a film that the whole family will delight in. Great fun. **** Timeless; Here's another film I watched back-to-back every day for a couple of weeks, when I was younger. I recently picked up the DVD and was instantly pulled in again. I ended up watching it again two days later. Anyway, I must point out that watching it when you're a child and watching it when you're an adult will result in two different experiences. Watching it recently I laughed my arse off at jokes I didn't even know were jokes back then; even simple things like \"Buzz LightBeer\" can have quite an impact. Alright then, enough of that. The film is 100% perfect the way it is. The characters are so full of personality, so full of humanity, and how it perfectly expresses emotions of loneliness, rejection, and love through a couple of toys is astounding. The movie has a sort of episodic appeal to it, wherein each episode leads to one collective end. It also seems that the worst that can happen to our protagonists does happen. It makes for one unpredictable plot. There's plenty of darkness here, especially with the whole Sid scenario, or when Buzz tries to fly. Did I mention the soundtrack? Randy Newman was perfect for this job; the music has a childish aura to it, but also helps accentuate the emotions of certain scenes. Can't imagine why he wasn't asked to work on the sequel. Anyway, Toy Story has received countless awards, and it is my opinion they are deserved. The Best Kids Movie of the 90's; Despite being the first full-length computer-animated movie, the movie's strengths are its plot and characterization.  The technology is not thrust in your face and simply serves to support a truly excellent animated film. A classic. Proof that Pixar not only cares about the quality of their work,they care about our kids.; Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library. my Personal Favorite of Pixar's Work; I remember seeing this film at the ripe age of seven, and I was totally entranced by it. What kid would not have been attracted to that sweet of a premise? Released way back in 1999, it was totally different from the usual hand drawn animation, and yet still as vibrant, if not more so. Even now as an 18 year old dude I find it so amazing. Attention to detail has always been Lasseter's strong suit, among many I might add. But the greatest thing about this film was the life evoked into its unique and untouchable characters. With the voice talents of Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, as well as the hilarious Don Rickles, and the late Jim Varney, the voice acting was perfect and the dialogue was surprisingly intelligent throughout. What could be perceived more or less as a simple story is told with heart and humor, one that hasn't aged a bit since that first viewing. I still own my original VHS copy in fact, but perhaps it's time I buy it on Blu-ray or DVD. Cynical and disturbing; This is one film that left me with a very sour aftertaste.  Yes, it's animated with character and vigour, and there are some fine -- if over the top -- voice performances.  However, there are some very disturbing aspects to the film.  The first is that it's like nothing so much as watching a 90 minute advert.  Even if merchandising hadn't been released to support the film, all the supporting cast could already by bought in your local toy shop.  I'm sure I wasn't the only viewer who found this more than a little suspect. Possible spoiler: The second, perhaps larger, point against the film lies in the characterisation of the two boys, Andy and Sid.  Andy is the \"good\" boy. He plays safely and passively with his toys, they don't do anything toys wouldn't do.  Sid, the \"bad\" boy is more creative.  He adapts toys to fit his own vision, he's an innovator, a creator.  It's this very creativity of his that is portrayed as a bad thing.  Sid isn't the ideal target audience for this film: he wouldn't be satisfied with row after row of identical shop-bought toys, he would much rather make his own.  I guess this review is being written for all the Sids out there, who are demonised and vilified by this ultra-corporate nightmare of a film. You've got a friend in me; \"Reach for the sky\"! The opening statement of Woody (Hanks) a toy cowboy during a boys playtime. A statement that proves to be ironic when he later looks up at a toy from space, Buzz Lightyear (Allen). Woody's owner is growing older and Woody struggles to accept the change as Buzz becomes Andy's new favourite toy. Leading from the once strong leader into a bout of jealousy and even malice as he tries to take Buzz out of the picture. Woody is then separated from Andy via a fight with Buzz and has to find a way home. Further change occurs as Woody is forced to align with Buzz to escape the toy antagonist Sid. It takes 3/4 of the movie for Woody to finally change his ways, and work with Buzz for the final great escape. Woody's journey from leader to outcast to redemption is intriguing to watch unfold. His final monologue with Sid was beautifully written as the toy out wits the boy. The whole irony of his story is that a child's mind is fleeting and 10 minutes of playing with Buzz and Woody would have been in the game again. For me it is Buzz that follows the greater path of change. Noble and confident throughout mostly due to being under the illusion he is an actual space ranger. Kudos to the writer who decided to take a toy from this world and make him believe he is real! Simple but incredibly compelling. Buzz's final realisation that he is a toy is arm breaking for him but heartbreaking for us. For a family movie Buzz's breakdown is surprising and well delivered and the journey back to being he hero has Buzz literally \"Reaching for the sky\". With us the viewers figuratively as we are up there with them cheering the final events. Woody and Buzz's journey home is supported by a cast of toys, each with a filled out personality. Loyal Slinky being one of my favourites, always reluctant to turn on his buddy Woody like the others. It's the direction of John Lasseter that puts us into this world. When Woody shouts \"You are a toy\". It's John speaking to us. From the beginning the camera is at ground level. We are not supposed to be a child watching his toys come to life but an actual toy, low level shots panning up throughout give a feel to the vastness of a toys world. We are right there through each playtime, adventure, triumph and failure and by the end Buzz may be flying but we are falling for these toys, in style. The story and characters are a success but the triumph is the medium in which the story is told. Through 3d animation, never before seen feature length. The Pixar animators made a bedroom and a pizza planet truly realistic. They brought toys to life in movement and texture. But most astonishing of all, they made us care for a bunch of 3d shapes put together through countless hours of rendering in a computer. The result is a metaphor for change, not just in the story itself and it's characters but in the medium it is told. The great change from 2d to 3d animation which is now common place for feature animation. This movie is a game changer for cinema and animation alike. Walt Disney and co did it in 1938. 54 years later John Lasseter and co did it again. The possibilities for 3d animation in film are Infinite, and Beyond...? Another Childhood Favorite!!!; I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since. It has a great storyline. Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, and many more. On Andy's Birthday, he receives a Buzz Lightyear action hero, and Woody becomes jealous because he isn't Andy's favorite anymore. When Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, his friends want nothing to do with him. On the way to Pizza Planet, Buzz confronts him in the family van, and knocks him outside and the family drive off without them. They go through a lot trying to get back to Andy before they move. When they end up in Sid's room, the kid who tortures toys, Woody and Buzz must work together in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TOY STORY!!! On it's 20th Birthday, Toy Story still soars To Infinity and Beyond!; In 1989, Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help. They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as \"Toy Story\", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about. First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the \"I'm Mrs Nesbitt\" sequence and the \"You Are A Toy\" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies \"You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic \"To Infinity and Beyond\" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history. There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's 81 minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" and \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" hit the right notes by being memorable songs. Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school. Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late 2000s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy 20th Birthday. Absolute perfection!; Hard to believe it but this, one of my all-time favorite movies, is already five years old.  And you know what, it's aged beautifully. Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest animated films of all time.  And not only that but it's also one of the funniest comedies (animated or otherwise) ever written.  I remember when this first came to theaters and everyone came to see the animation.  Don't get me wrong, \"Toy Story\" would still get a solid ten (if only the ratings went to 11) on eye-candy value alone.  However, the thing that gets me watching it over and over is the script. In short, this is the one animated movie that's *almost* more quotable than \"the Breakfast Club\". I can't imagine that there are people out there that haven't yet seen \"Toy Story\", even though I've met a few.  Go watch it, already!  You can thank me later. This movie is *perfect*. Instant Classic; Every company has that one movie that puts them on the map. That is what Toy Story did for Pixar. Toy Story is a cartoon about a little boy's toy collection that is alive when the little boy is not around. His name is Andy and he loves his toys, and they love him back. Woody is a cowboy and is Andy's favorite toy. The toys always get worried every Christmas and birthday because they fear they will be replaced by a bigger and better toy. The story starts off with Andy's birthday party and all of the toys are on edge. It turns out that a new toy by the name of Buzz Lightyear challenges Woody as the favorite toy. Buzz comes along, steals a little bit of the spotlight and Woody gets incredibly jealous. Eventually Woody and Buzz get lost and must find their way home and back to Andy before he and his family move away forever. Let's start with the toys. I loved these toys. Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Little Bow Peep, Woody, Buzz, Slink, Ham, and even Etch-a-Sketch are the main toys and each are lovable and different. Rex is hilarious because he is ironic. He is a dinosaur but he is a wimp, and he is my favorite of the toys. I remember watching as a little kid and I was always excited to see Rex on screen. Each character has their individual role. There are also toys every kid can relate with and that make the movie special. For example, the barrel of monkeys, the small soldiers, the etch-a-sketch, and Mr. Potato Head are toys every kid used to play with. The smaller toys aren't really relevant for long but when they are seen in the beginning and end of the movie their impact is huge. One of the major themes in the story is jealousy and the relationship between Woody and Buzz. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the favorite toy. Woody is a cowboy with a pull string that says some catch phrases. The other toys look up to him, he is a hero, and Andy loved him with all his heart. Andy dresses up like a cowboy, has Woody posters, and is obsessed with this toy. Woody embraces the love; it defines him, gives him confidence, and confirms that he is the leader. Then Buzz Lightyear comes into the picture with his better quality of a toy. He doesn't have a pull string, but a button Andy presses to have a better sound quality voice box will speak catch phrases. He is made of plastic, which is more durable and he has wings pop out which can simulate flight. Woody becomes incredibly jealous of Buzz and fights for Andy's love. He eventually knocks him out the window. Toy Story may be a kid's movie but it has an interesting and entertaining premise, especially with its characterization. Woody and Buzz both develop into better and stronger characters. Woody goes from a pompous, jealous, selfish, toy, into a respectable and lovable character. He and Buzz become best friends and inseparable, a little cliché, but it's a movie for families so it's perfect. When Buzz first appeared he thought he was a real \"space ranger.\" He was convinced that he was not a toy, he could really fly, and he had a dangerous \"laser\" which was really a blinking light bulb. He develops and he eventually accepts the fact that he is a toy but he is a \"cool toy.\" He is \"Andy's toy.\" Woody admits his jealousy to Buzz and that becomes a turning point in their relationship. We have our villain in the movie, Sid. This kid is just evil. He is a spoiled kid who \"terrorizes toys, just for fun.\" One scene we the toys in Andy's room watch him as he straps firecrackers to a Commander Carl and it explodes. First of all, what kind of nine or ten year old kid plays with explosives? If he isn't nine or ten, what is he doing playing with kid toys? He may tear them apart and put different parts on them, making them scary and horrific for children to even see on screen, that just doesn't make sense. His character fits for a children's movie but in reality a kid like this would never exist in real life. Sid is really my only problem with the movie, but still a character needed for the film. Overall, Toy Story is a classic and put Pixar on the map and was the beginning of a highly successful company. It came out in the 1995 and families everywhere fell in love, including me. It is a movie that can be watched again and again no matter what age. It is a movie kids will show their children when they are older. Teenagers lined up to see Toy Story 3 years later because it meant so much to them back when they were little. Toy Story and its characters left a rare imprint on the hearts of people all over the world. Without a doubt, Toy Story gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and goes down as one of my personal all time favorite animation movies. Toy Story; The story is about toys. The boy who named Andy has toys and enjoys playing with them. To be surprised, their toys can talk and act freely. Nobody of human know the fact. Woody who is Andy's cowboy toy spends a good time, however, Andy's new toy appear for Woddy. The toy's name is Buzz Lightyear. Woody and Buzz fight all the time and loses sight of their family and toys. They tries a lot of ways to meet their family and toys. The film is a long film by Pixar Animation Studious. The genre of the movie is animation, comedy and fantasy. It has dialogue and colors. It has sound effect and it is good to use the way of music. I like the scene that Woody and Buzz success in getting into a car that Andy rides. The film can be enjoyed by only children but also adults. cute; The movie is so cute. The story is about toys. A lot of people had a lot of toys when they were young or they may still have some toys yet. Also, a lot of children have a lot of toys now. Therefore a lot of people can enjoy watching this movie. Not only children but also adult and elder people are interested in the story. There are always a lot of toys around us, so we don't think about toys a lot. \"Toy Story\" indicates toys' feeling. If we use our toys rough, toys may be sad. If we cherish our toys, toys may be happy. By watching this movie, the audience can understand about toys. It is good movie. Children in the movie is young, so people who go to kindergarten or elementary school know how to treat their toys by watching the movie. After watching this movie, I love my toys and I notice that it is important for me. Best Disney ever; Finally a Disney movie which isn't moralistic but just fun to watch. Also it doesn't have the boring \"sing-along-songs\" so this movie is also a perfect movie for anybody about 10 years and (much) older. I really liked the computer-generated graphics because the characters moved very smoothly, something which can't be done the original way. More of these masterpieces in the future please and I will really like Disney at last, but dont't make it to moralistic and musical. That this movie is above all the other Disney -movies in the IMDB top 250 is proof of that. Good, Creative charm for kids and adults!; I'm not a huge fan of animated films, so coming into Toy Story I had very low expectations. At first, I thought it was Meh. Then, as the movie progressed it got better and better. Buzz is funny, Woody is a good cowboy, Sid is awesomely evil. Toy Story has an amazing cast as well. I mean, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, AND the Amazing Don RICKLES as Mr. Potato Head! Toy Story keeps kids and adults on their feet and I'm praising it so much because I have never seen any ANIMATED film as good as Toy Story so far. Disney really worked their magic into this classic. Toy Story FTW. I'm going to go rent Toy Story 2, and see if this film series has advanced even further. Pixar kick ass!; Yap. Those talented people at Pixar shows us that computer animation can be just as alive and creative as drawn animation. People think that the computer \"does all the hard work\", but that's not true. 3D animation can be just as difficult, if not more. The voice talent people are great and the animated characters clicked well with the pre-recorded voices. Everything from the toys' facial expressions to body postures is done well, but the real success of the movie comes from a perfect script. As long as the same creative team sticks around, I wouldn't mind ENDLESS sequels to TOY STORY. Cute Family Movie; Toy Story is a great movie for children and adults. Children will enjoy it simply because it is a cartoon. They will find it exciting because it shows toys coming to life which is something every child pretends with their toys. It's a good movie for children because it teaches them about jealousy, friendship, and teamwork. Adults will appreciate the animation and the accuracy of the details in the toys. Most of the toys used in this film were ones most people had as children. Such as, Mr. Potato head, the slinky dog, etch-a-sketch, and the army men. The theme of Toy Story is friendship. The movies theme song was titled \"You've Got a Friend in Me\". The friendship in this movie is about overlooking insecurities and finding a true friend in someone that you think would be your biggest enemy. A 2001 movie called Monsters Inc. is directed around this same theme. A little girl named Boo should be afraid of the monsters as much as the monsters are afraid of her but they form a friendship that overcomes their differences. Toy Story is about the lives of toys owned by a boy named Andy. Andy is having a birthday and he gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear. Andy's toys worry about him getting new toys because they are afraid they will get lost or donated. With the arrival of Buzz, Woody fills that Andy will like Buzz better. He tries to lose Buzz but instead he accidentally knocks him out of a window. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were brilliantly matched for being the voices of Woody and Buzz Lightyear. The personalities of the actors and characters seemed to be a perfect fit. The other toys in the movie, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky dog (Jim Varney), Pig named Ham(John Ratzenberger), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), and Bo Peep(Annie Potts), feel like Woody did this on purpose because he was jealous of the attention Buzz was getting from Andy. In order to make things right Woody realizes he needs to get Buzz back. Woody and Buzz both wind up separated from Andy and this is where their adventure begins. From this point on they work together to get back to Andy's before his family moves. Along the way Buzz realizes that he is not a space ranger but a toy. Woody tries to help Buzz understand that he is not just a toy and that he is very important to children. Woody convinces Buzz that they must get back to Andy. At the conclusion of the movie, Buzz and Woody are helping each other make it on the moving truck. They finally make it next to Andy who is excited to see both of them. Toy Story is about the friendship that is formed between Woody and Buzz. Once Woody was able to get passed his insecurities he realized that Andy could have two favorite toys. The motif of friendship is displayed throughout the movie by the relationships between Woody and Andy, Woody and all the other toys, and between Woody and Buzz. They also form a friendship with the strange toys at Sid's house. This movie is a true example of friendship. Really Sweet Movie!; Whether you're a fan of animated Disney movies or not, this movie is brilliant! It's great for family time movies or great for the everyday average Disney fan. The characters are put together very well. After I saw it, it made me actually think about throwing out old toys. I've been a fan of this movie ever since I was born(it was really big then) and I still watch it from time to time. I would definitely recommend this to anybody. Still Entertaining after 15 Years; I saw Toy Story in theaters in 95. As a kid it was funny, and original not just in story but in presentation. After 15 years the cg doesn't hold up in all areas. The human characters look stiff and the way background looks a bit flat. This plastic look works with toys so it doesn't become a problem. The movie holds up in every other area. The plot is engaging and the characters funny and likable. Toy Story is a family film it funny for children without talking down to them and enjoyable for adults. As a twenty something year old it is just as entertaining as when I first saw the original release. Fun for all ages; Toy Story is a classic among kids and adults, a classic among animation and simply one of the highest rated movies of all time. At first thoughts I felt yeah sure it is great but then after a little more time I came to realise this is incredible, I won't say it's 100% perfect but still it just exudes this feeling of well, fun. It's the kind of movie that only after do you really understand how Woody feels and how Buzz feels, you also realise how easy it would be to watch it again because it's really a calm but also an exciting watch. It's hard to call this a kid's movie owing to the fact that all fans of this back in the day are fully grown adults now, but the fact that they still return to this and say it is a masterpiece even today, well it shows how impressive this really is as well. The story is of course about toys, and in particular a new toy arriving because Andy the toys owner got a new Space Ranger named Buzz Lightyear for his birthday. Woody the favourite toy of Andy is jealous of Buzz's new found fame among all the other toys and starts to both feel angry but also kind of obsolete as well. The story moves along at a frantic pace, the amount of things that happen though to say this has an 81 minute run time is amazing and the timing is absolutely wonderful. Another point I found only after thinking back on the movie was the humour and how is just really good, one moment in a certain pizza restaurant arcade where we see a \"Whack-a-Alien\" game in reference to \"Alien\" sums up the overly kidult tone this movie possesses. Among the voices we have Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, Don Rickles as a small potato toy, Wallace Shawn in his trademark voice as Rex the dinosaur toy and the smoky voice of Jim Varney as Slinky the well, slinky toy dog. The voices are very memorable and the voice cast are perfectly picked, none seem out of place and maybe that is because of how much this movie has dug itself into film culture. I found Hanks and Allen's voices to be at the same level as each other only because they are both so great, Buzz is made even more courageous sounding by Allen and Hanks provides a kind of cool kind of toy voice but also brings out Woody's scared side or angry side well. John Lasseter the director is among many names behind this movie who seem to all hit the right spot with this, they create the first animated feature length picture and turn it into one of the still most popular of them all. The writers hit the movie from another flank, Lasseter brings humour out from his vision but I think the writers, Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow really bring another face to the movie where the humour but also the emotion can mix really well. As animation goes it of course does not look as it maybe did back then (still isn't bad though), although it doesn't matter anyway because it is the storytelling that blows you away and the characters really grab your attention. Pixar kicked off their stellar works in animated movies in style and brought not only a new way of making a movie, but also a fine way of telling a story and not making it over the top or just for kids, this is for everyone. There isn't too much too find wrong with this I mean, maybe some of the jokes aren't great, but really they may be still good anyway, it is kind of a movie that you can easily watch again without feeling it will quickly become boring, the kind of movie that is fun for quite literally, all the family. Great Fun For Kids And Adults Alike; Toy Story is one of those rare animated movies, designed for children, that adults can enjoy. Plot In A Paragraph: Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) is 8 year old Andy's favourite toy, however his world falls apart when Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) figure for his birthday and he has to play second fiddle to the new space ranger. I loved this movie. Over the years I have watched it with both my kids and nieces and nephews and they have all enjoyed it. Watching it now, it has lost none of its charm. Tom Hanks is superb as Woody, Tim Allen (who I'm not a fan of) is delightful as the deluded Buzz Lightyear who is not aware he is an action figure, but for me the stand out voice was John Ratzenberger as Pork Chop the Piggy Bank. Excellent Viewing, Every Time!; This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too. When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides. The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as \"Woody\" and Allen as \"Buzz Armstrong,\" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc. Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed \"winner\" as is the sequel.  \n",
       "1  A treat for fans of family fantasy fun.; As a child, Alan Parrish becomes trapped inside Jumanji, a magical board game he finds discovers buried in a building site. 26 years later, Judy and Peter Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce), two orphaned kids living with their aunt, discover the game in the attic of their new home and begin to play, freeing the now-grown-up Alan (Robin Williams) in the process. Unfortunately, they also release a host of dangerous animals, deadly plants, and an unstoppable bloodthirsty hunter. Their only hope of survival is to finish the game, whatever the risks. Action packed, funny, heartwarming and even a little scary in places, Jumanji is an excellent family adventure for the whole family, and one that, thankfully, doesn't rely solely on its special effects to impress (a good job, since quite a bit of the CGI is looking rather dated). The story is engaging (with a nice time-travel style twist at the end), the cast is great (with Williams managing to give one of his less irritating performances), and once again director Joe Johnston delivers a final product that, whilst not a classic, is still thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb. A walk in the memory lane; We (me and my brother) used to watch a cartoon named \"Jumanzi\" every Wednesday, back in 2000. Watching this movie talk me through a walk in my memory lane. The great Robin Williams also makes me nostalgic. 26 years, struggling and surviving, and than fighting back to get their life back. It is called human spirit. Though, every bit of it is fantasy, the plot become more human, when Robin remembered his saviors, who give him another chance in the game. Really good movie; Jumanji is a really good movie. I read the book and saw the movie and they are both really good. It got a little weird at times but only a few parts. I liked Robin Williams in this movie. The FX is cool. The monkeys don't really look real. You can tell it was computer generated. Over all it was good. It kept you on the edge of you seat. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good adventure movie for kids. Think of it as Night At The Museum meets a board game; Jumanji is based off a cartoon TV series that was made into a film in 1995 and stars funnyman Robin Williams who plays a man called Alan Parrish who as a kid played a board game called Jumanji which was been buried since 1869 with his friend Sarah(Bonnie Hunt)in the year 1969.But when Alan plays the game he gets sucked into it as his friend Sarah watched in horror as each time the player plays the game consequences occur and the only way to finish the game is to play the whole thing. Fast forward 26 years later in 1995 and two young children played by Kirsten Dunst (from the Spider-Man franchise)and Bradley Pierce who's parents died along time ago are now living with their aunt as their aunt bought Alan's old house.But when the two kids stumble across the board game as they hear the drums playing in the background in the attic,its up to them to try and finish off where the player left off and free Alan who helps them finish the game with his friend Sarah. But will they finish the game. Overall this film is really good until the very end which was sorta confusing for me. If you seen it you know what it is but it involves time travelling back to 1969 and then back to 1995 again. But still if you are a fan of Fantasy movies,Robin Williams and if you love something to keep you entertained on a lazy Sunday afternoon Jumanji is worth checking out. Outrageous fun; When young Alan Parish and his childhood friend, Sarah play a board game that Alan found buried near his fathers business, Alan is sucked into the game and left to grow up alone in the jungle. That is until two young children, Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) join the game and release him 26 years later. Every turn in the game becomes a living nightmare that endangers the lives of everyone involved, and the only way to stop it is finish the game. Alan (Robin Williams) and Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) will have to play some more if there lives are return to normality. The concept of the movie is truly original and it successfully delivers on its potential, with an excellent cast and funny script, this adventure is both hilarious and action packed, with some cool special effects thrown in. Great family entertainment 8/10 A lovely little film; This four year-old film, I would highly recommend for anyone out there in fantasy-land. Nice special effects, a very good idea behind the plot and Robin Williams all ensure a thoroughly enjoyable experience if you like action-comedies without the ubiquitous \"Good vs. Bad\" show-down. Jumanji is very different and well worth seeing. I look forward to the upcoming Jumanji 2 next year;  the cast for Jumanji 2 probably needs to include Gerard Depardieu instead of Robin Williams!!!! :-) Jumanji a great classic movie of the mid 1990's; I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was. The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done. This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too. Probably worth checking out, even today; There is a lot to like in this movie. The concept was intriguing. Robin Williams plays a basic Robin Williams character, i.e. a man-child. I never would have recognized Kirsten Dunst or Laura Bell Bradley as children without the cast list, but they both performed well. David Alan Grier did befuddlement just as well back then as he does now. Bebe Neuwirth and Bonnie Hunt did nicely, and looked very nice as well. The pace got a bit frenetic for me, though I understand that this was deliberate. The CGI animals looked fine in the distance but up close, not so much. I know we are spoiled by the unlimited effects in films today, but some of these, like the lion, looked terrible. I saw in the credits that they had Industrial Light & Magic, so I doubt it could have been done any better at the time. And some of the things in the ending did not seem to totally follow from the body of the film. It's probably worth checking out though, even today. Jumanji  a timeless adventure story; There are few children's movies that I particularly enjoyed  I can recount The Borrowers, Labyrinth and The Neverending Story. Jumanji, however takes a new place among children's films  in fact, it may seem that initially, Jumanji is about simplistic story about kids playing a board game. Based on a gorgeous picture book story of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg, this movie takes a beautiful magical adventure and makes it into a thrill ride that defies all natural laws. Time travel, physical transformations, perceptual distortions and multiple universes are just a few of the things that Jumanji toys with. The most evident phenomena is that the characters run in two different and parallel universes, one where Jumanji exists, and the other where it is just a dream. The life of Judy and Peter as orphans exists in a different world from the one where Jumanji doesn't exist  in other words, Jumanji is a catalyst of fate, an evil entity that does not bring about awe as it did in Allsberg's book, but fear. The world that Allen Parrish is doomed to be incarcerated in the jungles of Jumanji is another one, but that period of time is nonexistent in the world he will eventually live in. This is the beauty of the movie; that these characters can only allow their trauma and epiphanies to cross worlds. With each roll of the dice, the characters grow and change. The ending with 'Jumanji' is mark of the end of that universe  everything that the jungle world had yielded, from the colonist-hunter Van Pelt to the roaring stampede and the monkeys had to return, to be sealed into the game and the universe. The game controls life; but it is merciful when played to the end without cheating. The mental agony and pain must have been tremendous for the Parrishes. Presumably, Alan spent his twenty six years in the jungle, but returned to his old self only to again relive his life as if it never happened. The temporal distortion must have presumably had an effect on his parents, although only Sarah seems to notice. (She was playing the game  and only those playing are directly affected, but in the game universe of Judy and Peter we see a problem in the movie's understanding of temporal change) The power of fate in deciding the endgame was critical in the film. It seems that the game was in itself a game of a game; it was all planned out and ready to go. In fact, it also seems that no matter how crazy or perilous the situation is, the characters cannot be killed. Even Van Pelt says at the Sir Sav A Lot that \"I am hunting only Alan. I won't kill you, since you didn't roll\" He too is bound to the rules of the game, no matter how much of a colonialist he is. The game instills a high level of fear without death, in order for the game to continue, all the characters must be present. So in one way, no one need be scared of anything in the game. Instead, the game builds resilience in the characters. It was natural that in the end the end was initiated by the future; or more appropriately the past. At the end, both Sarah and Alan make up for the trouble they have caused and have a life bond from the experience. The jumping between 1994 and 1964 is a critical aspect where we see that the horrors of the game have allowed Judy and Peter's parents to not die in the ski accident. They are oddly willing to put an end to their vacation when they hardly know the Parrishes \"In the jungle, you must wait, until you roll a five or eight\"  Jumanji \"Roll a two, roll a four, but never ask for more\"  Gautam RATING: 10/10 (amazing) An entertaining, chaotic adventure, one which impressed me as a kid and still does now; I first heard of this successful family adventure movie at school in the late primary grades. It must have been new to the VHS format at the time (meaning I missed its successful theatrical run), and a student in my class brought a copy in for show and tell. I think I was interested in seeing it for months before I finally did. I remember watching it more than once on video in the summer of 1996. After those months of anticipation, I don't think I was let down, even if it did seem weird and scary the first time, with all the chaos. I guess I wasn't used to seeing that in films at the time. I've watched it again twice in recent years, after growing up, and both times, I found that it was still entertaining, unlike some movies I enjoyed in my childhood. In 1969, Alan Parrish is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Brantford, New Hampshire, with an upper class family. One day, after being ambushed by a group of bullies, he hears a mysterious sound of drums coming from a construction site! At the site, he digs up a box, where the sound is coming from, a box which was buried there 100 years earlier! Inside, he finds a board game called Jumanji, and takes it home. When Alan is at home by himself after a falling out with his father, his friend, Sarah Whittle, comes over, and he shows her the game. They begin to play it, not realizing how powerful and dangerous it is! Alan is sucked inside, and Sarah is chased off by bats that come out of the game! 26 years later, two kids, Judy and Peter Shepherd, whose parents have died, move into the old Parrish house with their aunt Nora. The siblings hear the drumming of Jumanji from up in the attic, and find the game. They start playing the game without a clue, just like Alan and Sarah did, and dangerous animals begin to come out of it! Also, Alan is finally released after being trapped in the jungle for 26 years! He learns that the year is 1995, and sadly, his parents have passed away. He must now continue the game with Judy and Peter, and reunite with Sarah. The four of them are all players now, and they must finish the game if things are ever going to go back to normal, which will obviously be very risky! The film starts well with the spooky 1869 sequence, when the box is buried out in the dark. After that, it's usually pretty good around the beginning. During the first of my two latest viewings, I remember finding most of the movie dull before Robin Williams comes in, but with my last viewing, I didn't find that to be the case. There isn't much humour during this part of this film, but there is some suspense. When Williams does make his boisterous entry, that's when the humour starts. After that, there's both excitement, with all the action and chaos, and humour. Williams provides laughs with his antics, but the film doesn't rely entirely on him for the humour. Sarah's reluctance to continue the game in 1995, the scene with Van Pelt, the trigger happy hunter from the game in a gun shop, and Aunt Nora and Officer Carl Bentley witnessing some of the Jumanji animals are also funny. Other merits of \"Jumanji\" include some poignant moments, good CGI effects (even if they're not the best, and have been topped since then), and decent acting, which includes decent child actors, unlike some films. All these things are what I think makes this film good family entertainment. HORRIBLE!; This was on TV again recently, and naturally the kids stopped to watch it. Why I will never know. We own a copy and they rarely if ever put it in the VCR. Whose idea was this movie? Joe Johnston, the guy responsible for some of the worst movies of the 1990s and whose only really decent film was HONEY, which was way back when? I have said previously this is really a horror movie in disguise and obviously not a particularly good one. What in hell is with the special effects? Is there a worse-looking set of animals in film history? I wonder all these years later if maybe the distorted, cartoonish look of the monkeys and lion were intentional, since they sprang from a children's board game. But then why do the elephants, rhinos, pelican and even the oversized mosquito, look relatively normal? Robin Williams is about as bad as he ever got, except for the nightmarishly bad JACK (although I never saw his ripoff of Benigni, which I can just imagine to what depths he plummets, and I forgive him WHAT DREAMS MAY COME since he obviously did not write or direct that fiasco). View JUMANJI at your own mental peril! Dangerous Boarding Game; In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called \"Jumanji\" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan's father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. \"Jumanji\" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90's. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Jumanji\" In the Jungle You Must Wait, Until the Dices Add 5 or 8; This film is about two children playing a mysterious board game that was left by the previous owner of the house they're living in now. They play it and the game begins. A man comes out from the game after staying there for a decade. They figure out the game is dangerous and think it would all go away if they just finish it. During the coarse of the game, there is peril everywhere! This is a good movie, not better than Zathura, but it's still good. I have to warn some parents out there because if you're taking your kids to see this movie, it might scare them. Might. Although it didn't scare me because I'm 14. Characters get hurt. Some even die. There are funny moments and sweet moments. This is a good film that anyone could enjoy. Probably not your little children. Quite a Lot of Rapid Movement; I worked for several years at a bookstore. I remember when the children's book \"Jumanji\" came in. The book jacket with the reckless monkeys was very catchy. It was a very short book, so I have a feeling that some liberties were taken with the plot. There had to be a ton of extrapolation. This is a rapid fire movie which at times takes a bit of industry to keep up with. There are rules to the game and for me, they are very hard to follow. There is also a time element that is in play here. Robin Williams, as usual, plays his character to the hilt. The kids are pretty good as well. I'm sure this would appeal to a younger audience. There is no time for attention spans to expire. The computer generated graphics are wonderful, to be sure. Those monkeys are really the stars of the show. Unique; I am trying to find my words in order to perfectly describe Robin, but i just realized that it's impossible to do it. Words are not enough to describe such a man... I've seen a lot of people in my life, all kind of people, but i never saw someone having so much warmth and kindness in just a small smile like Robin. That's something which makes you to love him unconditionally. The way he acted in the movies was so original that it can not be compared with anyone else in the history of cinema. He's smile made us all better people a little bit, which means he changed the world in he's own way. He will be always with us, and within us. Let's make him immortal !!! Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a 10/10. No No No -- its a 10; This is one of those films which sort of faded into obscurity at time of release but will I believe over time be considered a classic. I have seen it over a dozen times. And, for the purposes of this review, the reason I mention that fact is to ask the obvious question... why? And the why is because of the narrative. It is nearly perfect. Heck, it may even be perfect. If you are going to create a hi-CGI fantasy about children, geared to the child within (so to speak) you need to jump down the rabbit-hole is a convincing way, so that there is no hope of return. This is the essence of every good \"fantasy\" from the beginning of time, from Peter Pan to Alice In the Looking Glass to the Matrix. Once you are in, it is hard to get out. And that hooks the audience. What better way to establish such a narrative than a kid's game with \"turns\" and \"dice\"? Where each roll gets you in deeper? Also a great chance to watch to watch Robin Williams and Dunst before he/she became too old to play these roles; and Bonnie Hunt (great!) before her film career imploded. Postscript 12/14 -- with the recent passing of Robin Williams I wanted to add the following, especially after another viewing. First, it is one of the most perfect fantasies Hollywood has done since the invention of color film (keeping in mind that the best fantasies hail from the 30s and 40s). Second, and I know his fans will not agree, possibly Williams' best work. Early in his career, and he got a chance to play a boy in a man's body. Is there a more perfect role for him?? Hunt did not have what you would call a wide or varied film career but she is pitch perfect here, and matches Williams note for note, emotion for emotion. And Kirsten Dunst, another controversial figure, seems to have had a backwards career, with her impact dwindling as she aged. The highlight of her career may have been kissing Spiderman, but her face holds the camera here in every scene she is in, and she too is pitch perfect. Massively un-appreciated, one of the greatest films in its genre ever, right up there with Harry Potter or Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast. This Ain't No Game!; CONTAINS SPOILERS In 1869, two boys bury something unknown but whatever it is, it's very dangerous. It stays for 100 years. In 1969, young Alan Parrish rides his bike one lovely day, unfortunately he's soon chased by Billy Jessup and his gang. Alan goes to his father, Samuel's shoe factory. Alan tells his father what's up, but his father merely tells him that he must stand and face something you're afraid of, so Alan did and got the crap kicked out of him. Suddenly, he heard drums beating. It was in a construction site. He dug up a wooden board game called Jumanji. At home, Alan's parents have announced that they shall send him to Cliffside School for Boys. Alan refuses to go. Samuel get's mad and storms out of the house with his wife. Alan's friend, Sarah Widdle, comes over that night and the two decide to play the game Alan found. It resulted in Alan being sucked into the game until someone would roll a 5 or 8. 26 years later-1995. A woman named Nora, her niece Judy and nephew Peter buy the old Parrish house. One aternoon, while Aunt Nora left for the office and the kids were about to leave for school when they hear drums beating. The game was calling. They dig it out of the attic and decide to play it. Out of the game comes monkeys, mosquitos and a lion! Also, Alan comes out. He's very grateful, then goes to the old shoe factory to find his parents. He learns of their passing; by finishing the game, they can put an end to the wild animal attacks, so the three go off to find Sarah Widdle, because according to the game, it was her turn. At first she was reluctant to play, but she did. They encounter a huge pod plant and a hunter, Van Pelt who wants to kill Alan for some reason. Well, after braving a stampede, a huge rain fall, giant spiders and an earthquake, the game was over and all went back to 1969 where Alan patched things up with his father, he and Sarah get rid of the game and live happily ever after in the bright and cheerful 1995, rather than the dark one Jumanji had created. Pretty good movie! Nice special effects. Robin Williams was good, as always. Bonnie Hunt was good. The kids were too. Kirsten Dunst grew up to play Spiderman's love interest. Also, the same actor that plaus Samuel Parrish (Jonathan Hyde of Richie Rich) also plays Van Pelt. I hear there's going to be a sequel: Jumanji 2. But it doesn't have Robin Williams. For the life of me, I can't figure out what it will be like. But for now, you gotta see the first one! -- It's time to play the game. You can't move until somebody roll 5 or 8.; Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. \"Jumanji\" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game. The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078; Despite the fact that I am a huge Robin Williams fan, I had never seen Jumanji, it just never appealed to me, but even since Williams' untimely passing, I've been trying to view his entire filmography. I also wanted to catch the original film, before its reputation was irreparably damaged by next years re-make, featuring the Rock, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart. The film focuses on young Alan Parrish (Robin Williams), the son of a rich industrialist, who is always in the way. One day, he finds a weird board game, buried in a construction site, and decides to play with a friend, but this is no ordinary game, and Alan becomes trapped inside for decades. It isn't until two kids, moving into a new house discover the game and start to play it, that Alan is freed. Not wanting these kids, to face the same fate he did, they track down his old friend, and decide to finish the game and put the madness to an end. I think when Robin Williams played a child or a crazy person he was at his best. Those were the time when he could really just let go, be free, and be truly hilarious. As in most films like this, Williams is the film, the rest of the cast revolves around him, and without him, this is just another kids movie. Kids love these quirky, weird films, and parents hate being dragged to them, but Williams had a way of making both sides happy and making them both want to see it, that's what Jumanji was. For all intense and purposes this is a kids movie, with Williams acting like a big kid, but making adult jokes, innuendoes, and just being that guy who made him a legend. Almost Thoroughly Enjoyable; If I had been 10 or 12 when this movie came out it would probably be my favorite.  As I was 34, my first reaction was that there was too much screaming. But there's much here for an imaginative youngster (or oldster) to enjoy.  The script is generally witty, and except for the screaming, parents will not be bored watching it -- and if they squint their minds eyes enough to remember what they enjoyed before puberty, they'll get a nostalgic rush. This is everything family entertainment should be.  And though it does involve the supernatural, it is presented in a negative light and none of the characters relish being part of it. I guess that life is a game of chance!; You know the drill: young Alan Parrish gets sucked into a board game called Jumanji, returns when a brother and sister are playing 26 years later, and has to battle the animals that wreak havoc on the town. It all seems pretty simple, but they play some neat tricks with it in the movie. As the adult Alan, Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but still makes the character admirable. With good support from Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and Patricia Clarkson, this is a pretty interesting movie. I will admit that the monkeys looked pretty fake, but we can't dwell on that in this movie; the point is to enjoy oneself while watching it. Oh and one more thing: from \"Jumanji\", I learned the difference between alligators and crocodiles. If I could go back...; I love this movie. I don't know why. Maybe because I wonder what it would be like to start my life over again when I was 10 or 12, knowing what I know now at...well, much older. My favorite part is at the end, when Alan and Sarah come face to face in 1995 with the 2 kids who played the game with them the PREVIOUS 1995. Visually very interesting and not a rip off of any other film, that's for sure! Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Exciting Family Adventure; In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called \"Jumanji\", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished. Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human. The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like \"Dead Poet's Society\" or \"Good Morning, Vietnam\"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality. This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor. Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the \"Narnia\" stories). Fortunately, any moralising in \"Jumanji\" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of \"alternative timelines\". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10 Meaningful themes for all ages; This film is NOT a 'kids' film and it is NOT just another example of Hollywood making money off of an already existing product. Let me tell you what it is. It's a film that examines such pertinent themes as frustrated adolescence, negligent adults and wishes that do and don't come true. The cast is superb. The script provides them with enough action so that they can just do what they do best (ie comedy) without being 'preachy' with the messages that the writer was trying to convey. I was anxiously awaiting the sequel because I figured that, as movie technology advances, some of the flatness of the special effects would be fixed. Oh well. David Alan Grier was especially funny. He is one of Hollywood's best kept secrets. He belongs in movies not just T.V.. Decent family entertainment; On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children. Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it. Lame, lamer, lamest.; I guess this must be meant to appeal to kids, because has that R.L. Stein flavor to it -- you can't suspend disbelief because the whole thing is just so cheesy and lame. The closet thing to an interesting character is Carl the cop -- although Sara seeing a shrink after watching Alan vanish IS a hoot. Fine for the kids, but adults would do better with a book and a hot bath. Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... The jungle; This is an excellent movie for all ages. Congratulations to the cast, production, stunts and all the people. And now I want know what's happen in the jungle when Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) was there for 26 years. This should be a good adventure. This game is like no other.; Roll doubles and look out.  Elaborate special effects highlight this tale about two kids who release an imprisoned player trapped for decades in a supernatural board game. Story line is quite stupid, but this is so much fun to watch. Robin Williams does his thing. A young Kirsten Dunst is charming in this preview of her future talents. Rounding out this mish-mash of a cast are: Bebe Neuwirth, David Alan Grier, Bradley Pierce, Bonnie Hunt and Jonathan Hyde in a dual role. Special effects and sight gags are redeeming. The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for 25(?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\" Probably not perfect, but very fun; Jumanji is a highly imaginative and very fun movie. The visuals are good, and the story is creative and exciting. The storyline consists of a man being sucked into a board game. 26 years later, two kids find the board game and set him free. However, the game board has already released a few dangers, and those dangers must be stopped. The only way to do that is to finish the board game, and the animals (or whatever else was released from the game) will be put back into the game. There is action and minor thrills, and the movie emerges as being a fun experience. It's kind of creative, and it's an excellent adventure film. Sure, it is a bit cliché'd and the monkeys look pretty corny, but don't let them distract you from the overall enjoyment of the movie. 6.5/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment. original, not like any other game; I saw this when I was 9, and I was obsessed with it and saw it 3 times in the theater, and it was my favorite movie. The whole idea of slight, unhappy, 12-year-old Alan Parrsih (Adam Hann-Byrd-Little man Tate, Halloween H:20) getting trapped in a board game in 1969, for 26-years and coming back as a grown man. The idea was unforgettable to my interest in time, and I imagined my self then coming back 35-years old. The movie is so elaborate and original, the stampede was always my favorite, it's got such edge-of-year seat action with the Rhinos, Elephants, and Zebras crashing throught the wall at the last second, and they used the most dangerous animals possible. Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) ALan's childhood friend, and Peter (Bradley Pierce) and Judy (Kirsten Dunst, along with Alan play the game and bring Gian mosquitos, vines and a Hunter from the game. The movies also really funny especially the cop. Geeky Randy's summary; Fun family film about a magical board game that hosts many dangers that can only be stopped when a player finishes. The entire cast does their job well, but the only one not interchangeable is Hyde in a double-role as the main character's wealthy stern father and a big-game hunter (hint: intentional parallel). Entertaining from start to finish, but even children in 1995 were likely very aware that the scary creatures on screen were nothing more than special-effectsbecause of this, it's difficult to ever get lost in the delicious chaos despite all the funny moments and thrills. Still, despite its flaws, the story is interesting enough for the whole family enjoy and the film is good enough to be replayed every few years. *** (out of four) A game for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind; A fun family film about a game. I was sceptical, but as I like Robin Williams, I was obliged to go and see the film. The first thing that hit was the atmosphere. It's a bizarre and quite scary film. Well for a 7 year old anyway. Robin Williams plays the part really well but the real star of the film is the special effects. The stampede and various other disasters from the game were fantastic for their day. OK they look a bit dated now but in their time, they were some of the most advanced special effects ever used in movies. Bonnie Hunt steals the show with her humour and character. And the 2 children are fantastic as actors. The only thing that lets Jumanji down is the tag line. It gives away too much of the story of the film. But don't let that spoil things. The film is an unmissable adventure based on a small picture book. Surprised? You will be. IT's the most great movie EVER, you can't get Enough of it; I want to give this movie what it really deserve ,If i will say there is movie that i will never forget in my life ,it will be this great movie for the brilliant actor robin Williams. first of all, I want to thanks all the cast of this movie and the great director ,for bringing it to us. when I want to be refresh and happy and laugh I will watch it when I want to feel the power of love and the thriller of adventure, I will watch it , there are a lot of people how see it as for children only but its really not , it was like they know where to start and finish. this movie is for everyone its my best movie ever I give it 10%10 don't miss it Not board; Watched this on TV where it was aired as a tribute to the late Robin Williams. It's an enjoyable family-entertainment fantasy adventure with Williams playing a grown man who as a boy was sucked into a mysterious, dark board game called Jumanji, freed years later by a couple of young children who happen upon the game when they move into Williams's character by this time run-down house. Along with Williams also fully-grown girl friend of the time Kirsten Dunst, the four of them brave everything the game throws at them to finish it and free Williams to return to his old life. And does the game throw everything at them! Crazy monkeys, a roaring lion, a jungle which comes to life, hordes of stampeding elephants zebras and rhinos and one very persistent big game hunter. A veritable special effects fest, while the plot amounts to no more than awaiting the outcome of the next roll of the dice on the board, it all makes for good clean exciting fun and who amongst us as never enjoyed playing a board game as a child. The back stories about Williams being bullied as a child, having a fractious relationship with his dad and his adult wooing of Dunst are lightly drawn but all of course resolved happily ever after by the end. Williams is fine after he makes his delayed first appearance, portraying yet again a child trapped in a man's body just as he did in a line going back through Peter Pan in \"Hook\", \"Popeye\" all the way to his breakout part in \"Mork and Mindy\". Dunst offers good support and the kids aren't too gauche and sentimental either. Nice to see \"Cheers\" Bebe Neuwirth get a decent part too. I wouldn't call it Robin Williams defining role but as an update on the old children's matinée features, this was an entertaining feature made the better by Williams engaging performance. R.I.P. to him. When two kids from the 60's stumble upon a game, one of them is sucked into its jungle.  Now it's up to two present day kids to finish it.; ********/10 This movie deserves more than it received because it is not only a very different plot but has excellent character development, which is key to a great movie. The special effects are so-so (due to the time period in which it was made), but it is overall exciting while humorous. There isn't a movie quite like this one, and is one of my favorites. Robbin Williams is tremendous and while watching it you forget his true identity. Kerstien Dunst is young, but is impressive for her age, commonly not found in some movies. I guess if I'd have to sum this movie up in one word it'd be \"unique\". Not many films have monsoons indoors or mansions turned into jungles. The Disney movie that could have been; Hunt and Williams play the parts of shellshocked-delayed stress syndrome surviviors quite well. The story is entertaining and engrossing, with both elements of light and darkness. The effects-well, they DO look a bit unreal-and perhaps that is for the best-it adds a sense of unreality to the story -after all, these things come from a board-game universe! Even Van Pelt looks a bit CGI...and Bebe Nuewerth is a sweetie. Not for 13+ age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for 1980 not for 1995. Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. Watts meets New England; Disaster visits a New England town: When all hell breaks loose, when beasts from nowhere trample the streets and earthquakes rip the blocks and giant mosquitoes and God-knows-what-next befall the descendants of pilgrims and fishermen, of Minutemen and revolutionaries and of immigrants yearning to breath free, those same hard-scrabble, salt-of-the-earth, no-nonsense patriots all join hands, pull together, and-- . . . loot their neighbors' downtown storefronts! Unbelievable.  Tinseltown belts out a fairly well-done and imaginative fantasy (which truly `Jumanji' is), and then--wouldn't you know it?--foul it with one of the many flies stuck in the ointment that is Hollywood, a scene so diagnostic of the intellectual sickness that has infested the industry since Hellman sang her praises to Stalin.  Then again, maybe it is believable. `Jumanji's' only other flaws: a part too small for the underrated Bebe Neuwirth (a joy to watch always and here no less so), kids full of bravery that's a little too scripted and moments of suspense that really aren't. If we can ignore all that, even the brief bit of class-warfare propaganda, then \"Jumanji' becomes eminently watchable, even memorable. But promise us you won't loot any stores next time you see monkeys charging down the street. Grade A Effects; This movie is the kind of movie you wouldn't want to watch when you're trying to get to sleep. This movie is lurking with action and adventure around every corner, along with some animals. Great effects, good plot, and interesting characters. A *** out of ****. Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. Good, classic, family fun; Despite being rejected by many a film critic for being childish and lacking in the classic sweepstakes, I found this film more than enough to satisfy my evening desires. With its strong plot and good actors, this film has much going for it, despite slightly lame CGI, its the story that carries you on. I have heard few people praise this film but I believe it to be a classic due to having an eerie dark sense all the way through until the credits roll, whilst still maintaining comedy and being for the whole family. It is bound to keep the viewer thinking of the awful situation these people face long after viewing has finished. Overall, one of the high points of Williams' career, and Kursten Dunst has never been better. Try it, you might surprise yourself.  Excellent!; There is only one way to describe Jumanji: excellent. The plot is very, original, with outstanding concepts packed into each individual scene. After viewing this movie, the wild side of the jungle gets into you, making you want to dare to play the game. Although the computer animation may not look all that real, I still give this movie a 10/10, for an outstanding plot, casting, and spirit, which any great movie has. Almost 20 years on and it's still entertaining kids of all ages; Jumanji was on TV today, and my 8 year old son had liked him in \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and I remembered it being fun, so with sweets and crisps we sat down to watch it. Orphans Judy (A young Kristen Dunst, who had started in \"An Interview With A Vampire\" the previous year, but still a few years away from Spiderman fame) and Peter move in to a mansion with their Aunt (Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers) where the find a board game called Jumanji. When they start playing, they free Alan Parish (Robin Williams) who was trapped in the game when he was a child. Robin Williams is always fun to watch and he was very popular at the time, due to movies like \"Aladdin\" and \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and Kristen Dunst was a real talent as a young actress, none of the annoying traits of usual child actors. Of the supporting cast David Alan Grier is fun as a hapless Police Officer, as is Jonathan Hyde in duel roles as a hunter and young Alan's Dad. Defo worth checking out if you have kids, and more than enjoyable even if you don't. Some of the special effects have dated badly, but are still OK, most of the humour is spot on too. My son got a big kick out if it and really enjoyed it. And I thought for a 19 year old special effects laden kids movie it had held up pretty well. I love this film!; I loved this movie! First of all, my #1 favorite actress is Kirsten Dunst, who plays Judy! I have seen Kirsten in countless other films including: Bring It On, Disney's Anastasia, Mona Lisa Smile, Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2 (June 30), and (Duh!) Jumanji of course. We have a lot in common. I am a HUGE fan of Robin Williams as well. He has played in films that I've seen such as: Mrs. Doubtfire, (also starring Pierce Brosnan who plays the worlds greatest Secret Agent: Bond, James, Bond. Robin has also been in: Disney's Aladdin (The Genie), Patch Adams, Flubber, Biscentanial Man, and Hook. I have seen Bonnie Hunt in her t.v. show, Life With Bonnie, and Cheaper By The Dozen starring the ever sooooo funny comedian Steve Martin and my sister's favorite actress Hilary Duff. I have a lot of favorite actor's but only one actress, and that's Kirsten! When I first saw her in Jumanji I fell in love with her. She is one beautiful young lady. I didn't know who she was though, LOL!!! I didn't recognize her in Spider-Man \"sigh\". As I looked at the credit's I saw a name: Kirsten Dunst. I remember seeing that name in the end credit's for Jumanji. I just about fainted, LOL!!!! I rented Jumanji again, and I looked at her and I realized: \"Wow, she hasn't changed a bit!\" \"She's still got those big Blue eye's that I just love,\" she hasn't lost her sense of humor,\" and I will always, always, ALWAY'S LOVE HER SMILE! Every movie I've seen her in, she's always been a really hot Redhead, Well, in Jumanji she wasn't a redhead, but, SHE WAS STILL HOT! LOL!!!! She's a legend, to me. I looked at her biography on IMDb.com and I saw that she was born on April 30,1982! I just about fell out of my chair. LOL!!! I was born April 10,1988!!!!!! She's six years older than me, but heck! I still love her. But, I'll always remember her as that little girl named Judy in Jumanji! My favorite line that she said was when the Cop commented on Robin's clothes for the first time: \"He's a Vegetarian! I was sucking in air, I was laughing so hard. Another scene was in the rain in Jumanji when Robin and Bonnie were about to kiss, and Kirsten is in the back rolling her eyes! LOL!!! That brought be back to the upside down kiss in the rain in Spider-Man! Jumanji is a fun movie! It can be a little intense sometimes, but it can also be funny. One last thing: KIRSTEN DUNST IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE MY FAVORITE ACTRESS! THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE! Til the dice read five or eight \n",
       " Jumanji; Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in 1995, I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 1800's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in 1969, transporting him into the jungle world for 26 years until two new children stumble upon its drumming. Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time \n",
       " well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects. The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be \"real\", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end. The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still childrenone had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow upand with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think. There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as \"Soulman\" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the \"adult\" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal. A great movie; JUMANJI I loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today! The movie is about a boy who finds a board game called Jumanji. When he takes it home and starts to play it with a friend, he soon realises that this is no ordinary game. He gets sucked into the game and is not released again until 26 years later 2 more kids find the game and release him. Now he is grown up and has to find a way to end this game before everything it releases destroys the town. Due to the sad passing of the genius that was Robin Williams, the TV channels have decided to show all of his movies. Jumanji was the first one I saw. The story to this film is like not her that I had seen before. It was an original idea (unless there is another film I don't know about) that was just so imaginative. It works really well and has a great adventure element about it. The effects are average. This was made in the mid 90s so that probably has something to do with it. The animals were obviously not real. You could see the lion was so mechanical it made me laugh. And the other animals were so obviously computer generated. But it was comical and that just added to the fun of the film. The acting was great. The main character was played by Robin Williams. He was as energetic and full of character in this role, just like he brought to every role he took. Other cast members were Jonathan Hyde, a young Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bonnie Hunt. Bonnie Hunt was brilliant. Her reaction and facial expressions made me laugh a few times in this. Another stand out performance was by David Alan Grier. David was so funny as the cop. His comedy timing was excellent and deserves a mention. This film really does keep you entertained throughout and is just a lot of fun to watch... Even now nearly 20 years later. I will give this 7 out of 10. Normally I end my reviews with a quote from the movie, but this time I just want to say how gutted I am about the news of Robins death. I am a fan of his work. I watched Mork and Mindy when I was a kid and grew up watching Jumanji, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam, Jack etc... There were so many great films that he made. I always saw Robin as so full of energy and full of life. He had one of the greatest smiles in Hollywood and when i saw an interview with him, he seemed so chirpy and happy. It just shows that in front of the camera, you never know what is going on in people's heads. I was sad to hear he had been suffering from depression. Depression is such a deadly illness. I know this sounds stupid, but I am gutted that I was not there to talk to him, help him. I hate to think that he felt so alone, especially as he had millions of fans all over the world that knew him on screen. He made the world laugh out loud so many times. Even through bad times in my life, watching his movies has put a smile on my face. Robin deserved much more happiness than he got. He gave so much to me and the rest of the world and it doesn't seem right that he should end his life this way. I will miss seeing new movies from him, but will always continue to go back to enjoy his old ones. Robin will live on in my house and he will always continue to make me smile. R.I.P. Robin Williams. A 90s classic.; Jumanji has some decent acting from the adults and from the kids. Apparently this film is set in New Hampshire - the scenery is not all that, maybe because New Hampshire itself is not all that, but regardless this is a fun fast-paced adventure flick that is never boring. An error in this film is that this board game is depicted as some sort of master of the universe, the majority of the film is set in 1995 - When Alan is out of the game and everything else from the game gets sucked back in the film goes back to 1969 where Alan and Sarah are kids again, fast forward to the 90s and they meet Judy, Peter and their parents, i guess the movie wanted to make it an extremely happy ending where the parents get a second chance, but then at the same time Judy and Peter never remember Alan and Sarah, this is the definition of a fantasy movie, if you think about the logic of it too much it'll drive you crazy. Bottom line if this error never happened there'd be no movie, this is what a fantasy movie is - a motion picture that is completely out there and difficult to wrap your head around. A lot of the scenes are still embarrassingly funny - a few examples - when the monkeys shoot the roof of the car and drive off, some of the behavior and dialogue from the police officer Carl Bentley, when Alan and Sarah get stuck in the floor, and the result of Bentley's literal wreck of a car is embarrassingly cringe-worthy in itself. Jumanji actually has a realistic element which is the behavior of Alan's father, he doesn't seem to care that much about Alan, is self- absorbed expecting Alan to follow his footsteps with boarding school, and is generally quite strict and cold and just like Alan said during one scene - his father could barely even hug him. After Alan went missing the father got depressed, stopped going to work and that was the end of it, he only seemed to care about Alan when Alan wasn't there, what's the point of that?! it's like emotional displacement or something, it was all a little too late, but as we see at the end Alan's parents are still alive and it's clear that they have time to change their standoffish relationship. This is the definition of a children's movie - everything has to be happy with no tragedies at the end. Jumanji is very dramatic but brilliant especially the \"Iv'e seen things you've only seen in your nightmares\" scene and the \"26 years ago you played a game with a little boy down the street\" scene - those two pieces of dialogue were done fantastically by Robin Williams and his facial expression and body language worked perfectly with the dialogue. This motion picture also shows the viewers how children think, the scene where Alan mentions that he \"remembers the front porch being a lot bigger\" tells us that kids see everything bigger than they actually are. The funky new-age woman \"Sarah\" - the adult version is also a likable character even though she sometimes talks crap with her star- sign/zodiac-sign garbage. There is no chemistry between her and Alan though, but they can get away with it because that is not what this film is about. The special effects are what they are, they're not as bad as to ruin the movie. The actor who plays Alan's dad also plays the human hunter, why they used the same actor i don't know, but regardless he did a good job in both roles. Jumanji is set in a small town and if you are starting to dislike small town settings as i am then you can choose not to focus on the town and focus more on the main plot. Thankfully this flick only has literally a few main characters and it does a great job of making sure the plot outweighs anything else. Ja Rule Jumanji; 'Jumanji' is a drama comedy about a boy who is always picked on by a bunch of bullies. He gets sucked into a disastrous game board called 'Jumanji'. He was taken to a jungle for 26 long years. He then comes back after the dice read 8 and with the 3 other players who unleash the unexpected dangers of the jungle\n",
       " onto the real world. Alan Parish is a troubled boy with kids picking on him 24/7. One day while walking through a construction site he finds a chest that holds 'Jumanji' - the board inside it. He starts playing this game with a young girl, Sarah, where he is sucked into the game. After 26 yrs he comes back as a man!! Sarah Whittle is one of the bully's girlfriends and she brought back Alan's bike when he invited her in to play the game. She was really scared when Alan was sucked into the game, after that she was chased by bats all the way down the street. It looks so real but when she falls over and a bat is on her shoulder, it looks Judy and Peter are the two other players who live with their generous aunt because their parents had died in a car crash. Judy lies because it makes her feel better and Peter doesn't talk to any one except Judy. Peter turns into a half monkey/human for cheating, which special effects make this look real. Together all four encounter many different but dangerous stuff from the jungle. Not only does it affect Alan, Sarah, Judy and Peter, it affects the whole town. All in all 'Jumanji' is a rollicking imaginative adventure that will carry you away\n",
       " literally!! My Childhood; This movie made my childhood. I love Robin Williams movies, Jumanji introduced him to me. Jumanji is a movie that everyone should watch. Robin Williams will again make you appreciate living as he always does in his movies. The movie contains full of fantasy objects. The writer has a really great imagination. I will make my children to watch this movie after all years that pass. While watching this movie as a kid, I was scared, excited and happy. It makes you to feel every kind of feeling. This indicates that the movie has done a good job. I again recommend to everyone. Jumanji appeals for all ages. I am pretty sure I will watch the movie again when I get old with the same emotions when I watched it in the first time. Jumanji Review; Jumanji is a film directed by Joe Johnston based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg. Now I wasn't quite excited to see the films considering the reviews. But I did enjoy Zathura, the spiritual sequel to this film so I deiced to give it a go. And to my surprise I was quite entertained by the film. Plot: Judy and Peter play a board game to some disastrous results. Story and direction: The film opens up with 2 children from 1869 burying something and saying that whoever opens this up may God be with them. I mean this scene was basically not necessary. The film could have opened from 1969 with our protagonist Alan Parrish. We see Alan's world where he is bullied a lot and hides in his father's shoe factory. There we are introduced to Carl who I think was not necessary for the film in the first place. Then we see Alan taking the Jumanji game to his home and opening it. in the meanwhile, we see Alan's parents deciding to send him to boarding school to which he objects and decides never to talk to them again. Then Alan and Sarah begin to play the game when Alan gets sucked into it and Sarah getting scared runs for her life. Then the film takes a 26 year leap, where we are introduced to 2 new characters Peter and Judy, who have been given a quite nice back story. They open up the game and while they playing Alan comes out of it. Then we are taken on a joyride where the try to finish the game with a now grown Sarah. Now the thing that felt awful in the film was the CGI. It felt like you were watching some big patches of imagery that were just pasted onto the screen. Then I guess the Van Pelt character. He was just too laughable for me. And was wasted a lot. And finally, the revised 1995 version wherein some things were not explained rightly, according to me. Performances: Robin Williams made me remember that why I will be remembering him as a great actor. His comic timing was spot on. RIP Sir Williams. Bonnie Hunt was also great as Sarah. Kirsten Dunst was a great child artist in the film. So as Bradley Pierce. Favirite Scene: The scene where Alan pops up to save Peter and Judy from a lion and his joy that he has returned home after 26 years of being trapped in the game. Robin Williams just acted so great in this scene. Verdict: Although with some misses, Jumanji is a very much watchable film. I enjoyed my time with this movie. I am going with a 7.5/10 Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is 1969, and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats. 26 years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good! QFC - Jumanji; Jumanji is a fun filled film with great special effects, gripping action and it revolves around an interesting although absurd idea of a damned board game. However absurd this idea may be, it works as far as the adventure goes. It has many flaws because eventually the absurdity becomes too much and, especially for adults, it will become annoying because of its repetition in the the attempt of filling the movie with 'funnys'. Robin Williams himself is a pleasant surprise as the action hero. His choice may have been a little surprising, but alas, Williams shows he is able to be anything, anytime, anywhere. So hats off to his performance, not the deepest ever but an enjoyable turn for him. Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. My first childhood film and one of my all time favorites!; I was born in 1994 so I am one year older than but my Uncle bought a copy of Jumanji when I was in pre-school and the whole family watched it together. And after seeing the film for the first time, the story is just like a funny adventure to me and I really love it. I always sneak up to the CD cabinet to watch it again because my grandmother always gone mad every time I switch the CD player and the television. And after a several replays, the movie grown deeper to me; the message of the film and everything. Until now, I still watch the movie and still having lots of laugh. Early CGI Makes the Monkeys Look Fake! Otherwise It's Amazing!; An enchanted board game breaks into the real world and the only way out of it is to finish the game! The monkeys look \"washed-out\" and so do some of the wild zoo animals; which is why most of the rest of the EFX are mechanical or use backdrops and mattes. Otherwise a very strong 10 would be my vote, as the casting works and the plot shows lots of imagination and flair. With a \"sly wink\" to \"Peter Pan\", Alan's father plays both his dad and Van Pelt the Hunter. My two favorite scenes are when the house gets folded in half and eaten by the monstrous plant, and when everything swirls backwards into the gameboard. I also love it when the house goes \"wild\" and turns into a swamp complete with nasty alligators. I do not like the scene where the little boy turns into a monkey with a tail. Young children may find it disturbing like the donkey transformation in \"Pinocchio\". \"Jumanji\" is suspenseful and scary but no one actually dies in the film. Therefore, it's much more enjoyable when viewed again. The only one who seemed to hate it was Roger Ebert, but it's only too scary for pre-schoolers. Most \"users\" love it! What \"scares\" me the most in this film: the bats, insects, spiders, alligators, and The Hunter. The sequel will not have the charisma of the late and great Robin Williams. I still miss him. He was a comic genius. If there was a market for it, I would like it to be re-imagined with better graphics like the old \"Star Trek TOS\" reissue. A breathless unforgettable adventure!; I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind... This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure. Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story. Great! 10 out of 10 from me! Game Over, Man; Spoilers herein. The reason this film was made was because they could do the effects. That reason has no power now, and in fact most of them already look a bit cheezy. But there are some interesting elements: --Kirstin Dunst at her peak. --Robin Williams in his best role. Or rather for the role best suited to a manic comic. --A pretty cool house, one of the best in recent memory. --Some clever time folding. --A screenwriter's wet dream: in addition to creating a film world that sucks in viewer into an artificial reality, to have that film world contain another one. That world-within-the world is exactly as far from the normal world of the film as it is from us. Just like the film, it grabs us once we start and won't let go until the end. Clever idea. Not exploited. Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements. Jumanji: One of My Personal Favourites. Period.; I was about one years old when this came out, by three I was mesmerised by the analog and digital effects Jumanji contained. It stood aside the efforts of Jurassic Park, but more animal-based as Jurassic Park was dinosaurs. Robin Williams pulls off a strong performance as Alan Parrish. The film revolved his character playing the game and escaping the world the game brought to him. It had Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce aside Williams whom join this adventure. I believe the film took a creative angle, which more fluctuation that the book left for the imagination. Here it follows the book accurately, just with expansion amongst the book's basis. Hence allowed more adventure and opened more for the viewer digging themselves within this jungle adventure. I can go on about the film's details and how they amaze me. But I conclude Jumanji: One of My Personal Favourites. Period. wild CGI destruction gets repetitive; In 1869, two boys bury a mysterious dangerous wooden chest. In 1969 Brantford, New Hampshire, young Alan Parrish gets picked on by bullies. He finds the box in a local construction site. He opens the chest to find a board game Jumanji. His father is sending him to boarding school. He is about to run away when his best friend Sarah Whittle comes by. They play the game and Alan is pulled into the board game. Twenty six years later, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) buys the rundown mansion planning to open a bed-and-breakfast. She brings her niece Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter (Bradley Pierce) who lost their parents in a car accident. The kids find the board game in the attic and start playing it. Alan (Robin Williams) is released. They track down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) to finish the game and bring all the released apparitions to an end. Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) was a friend who worked at Alan's shoe factory and is now a cop. The game brings out big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) who looks like Alan's father Sam. The basic idea of a board game that comes alive is one with great possibilities. I wish that it is more than just a series of crazy CGI destruction. I wish that the players needed to use their brain power to solve clues. The constant escaping from one thing to the next gets a little bit repetitive. They start piling on top of one another. Williams is not quite as lovable as expected. Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier are kind of fun. There is an uncontrolled quality to this children's movie. Imaginative (spoiler); This is probably one of the most imaginative movies I have seen in a while. I mean, it has an entire back story, as we can see in the beginning, when those two kids are trying to get rid of the game. Then it goes to 1969, when Alan finds the game, he and Sarah start playing, and he gets sucked into Jumanji. Then, throughout the rest of the movie, Alan comes out of the jungle and he, Sarah, Judy, and Peter continue playing the game and unleashing all these dangerous animals (and Van Pelt) and the monsoon and killer plants into the city. And at the end, those kids in Japan find the game. Very well thought out. Certainly worth a look. pretty good, except...; Jumanji is an enjoyable, and at times exciting family adventure. Only one major flaw: the special effects. Jumanji relies on special effects for impact. Nothing wrong with that, only its so easy to tell that they are special effects. Enough fun to get you to sit through it, but they should really find another effects crew next time. 2/4 Fun!; I give this movie a ten on ten. I may be biased as I watched this movie when I was ten and whenever I watch it, it brings back fond memories of lazing around and watching movies during my summer vacations. But I am surprised that the overall rating for this movie is 6.5 (when I write this review), I expected it to be at least 7. This really is a fun movie to watch with some hilarious scenes. The monkey bike riding scene stands out it particular. The special effects looked good when I was young but now the fake animals are not very impressive. Jurassic Park was made before this movie and had much better special effects. Robin Williams does seem too old to play a 35 year old Alan Parish but he is a brilliant actor and you do not mind accepting him as Alan. Bonnie Hunt does a good job too as the paranoid Sarah Whittle. The kids do a great job too, especially Bradley Pierce; look out for the scene where he is searching for an axe. And David Grier is brilliant as the bumbling sheriff Carl Bentley. I suggest you watch this movie with your family on a weekend. Its worth it! Epitome of Moronic Hollywood Film-Making; A previous reviewer wrote: \"A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie.\" I agree in part and disagree in part with that comment. The problem is impossible to pinpoint, because there are PLENTY of \"big problems\" with this movie! \"Random hazard generator\" is the PERFECT description of the ancient board game! Random hazard after random hazard until the game ends is what is supposed to pass for \"plot\" in this movie. Did anybody count how many times the game board fell out of and back into the players' hands? That, too is supposed to pass for tension. Ultimately, the film fails because there isn't any development of the back story. What was the origin of the game? Now, that would have been an interesting question to explore! And how does the game work? All we ever see is the game's projection of \"random hazards\" OUTWARD into the reality of the players, but somehow Alan (Robin Williams) apparently was sucked INTO the game. How did that happen, and why doesn't it happen to any of the current players of the game? Actually, the guy in the pith helmet is, more or less, the human villain in this movie, but he is never more than an inexplicable, evil cartoon. Was he, too sucked into the game like Alan, or is he the sole human \"random hazard\" generated by the game? Why is he so determined, not to hunt animals, but to MURDER Alan? The film just glosses over the fact that this sub-plot is actually one of premeditated murder! The hunter guns for Alan simply because the plot demands it. But the movie makes no attempt whatever to explain the character. Never once did I sense any genuine emotional chemistry among the characters. Just a bunch of actors acting - not INTERACTING. The love story sub-plot felt obligatory, never genuine. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt never generated enough chemistry to make me care whether Alan and Sarah got together in the predictable end. All in all, this film has the germ of an interesting idea that is really wasted by focusing on mindless, non-stop \"random hazards,\" poor CGI effects, \"lots of screaming and running around\" and insufficient character development. Except for the precise nature of each \"random hazard,\" the whole film was disappointingly predictable, including the cliché of the almost-kiss in the midst of peril routine. How many zillion times has that been used? The dialog is a similarly endless stream of clichés. The issue was never HOW the game would end - but WHEN. The more interesting issues were never even glanced at. This kind of movie can only appeal to people raised on video games. It was generated by that kind of adventure-for-the-sake-of-adventure mentality, and it has that same kind of feel. LOVE THIS MOVIE!; Last night, May 2,2003  this movie was on again........no matter what other show we might be browsing at the time, we invariably start watching Jumanji,,,,,,we enjoy the hilarity and antics of all the characters,  it's done for shear  fun and entertainment, and we don't care if the special effects may be outdated,  we still consider it one of the best! So there! :-) Two  Happy Fishes  from oHIo Fine special effects, fizzled screenplay; This is another of those films where a 30-minute documentary on how they did the special effects would be a lot more interesting (not to mention a lot shorter) than the movie itself. The digital effects and animatronics are great; the screenplay doesn't work. A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie. The pasted-on homilies the screenplay comes up with _ the need for courage, commitment, real parent-child communication _ are drowned out in the hubbub, and a good cast (not to mention a big budget) is wasted. And they're planning a sequel to THIS? Have they run out of good (or even mediocre) films to do sequels to? Game You Could Only Dream About; Alan Parrish is the son of wealthy shoe maker Samuel Parrish. But the life of a rich man's son changes when young Alan comes upon a new board game, he is transported into it while playing it. Twenty or so years later two orphaned children, Judy (Kristen Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) come upon the game and play it. Next thing they now, Alan pops out of the game twenty years older along with a lion and some monkeys. It is a race to win the game with Alan (Robin Williams), Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt), Judy, and Peter while trying to outrun stampedes and Van Pelt, the man hunter. The movie has what a movie should have. The interaction of some of then animals is sometimes scary, sometimes funny, and sometimes just strange. Robin Williams is good like always and supported by Dunst, Hunt, and Jonathan Hyde (Van Pelt). It's what some mite call a child thriller. What to classify it as is though but it was good. Jumanji. Starring: Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kristen Dunst, Bradley Pierce, and Jonathan Hyde. 3 out of 5 Stars. Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Oh waw this is what Twister should be like!; Remember Twister? Well, this movie has probably got the same amount of special effects BUT is much more fun to watch. Let me explain. It has got a story to tell. Twister was only about twisters. Anyway, 'Jumanji' hasn't only got yummy fx, but also a verrrry good cast. Robin Williams ( 26 year old Alan Parrish ), Jonathan Hyde ( Sam Parrish/ Van Pelt ) and Bonnie Hunt ( Sarah Whittle in 1995 ) are the best members of the cast. From the moment the fun starts ( I mean, when they start playing the game ) it never ends. To be honest, the animals in this movie were almost real and I sometimes check my closet before I go to bed. You never know what could be in there... Here's what I think: the special effects deserve 10/10, the cast gets 9/10 so I think the movie must get 9,5/10. Now go and find 'Jumanji'! Wonderful adventure; My opinion: Do not underrate this movie that much. I didn't particularly like it - in fact I almost forgot about it for many years - but the story is simply very, very smart. The idea behind the plot is utter genius. Okay, the actual transformation did not work perfectly, but I insist that it was still a straight accomplishment that had 1. a nice cast, 2. sustainable visual effects and achievements, 3. a great story, 4. both funny and entertaining sequences, that even made you pause and think sometimes, which I regard as a major attainment of any movie. So - I'll give it a solid 7, which it deserves at least. a game not like the other ones; \"Jumanji\" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game \"jumanji\" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy. An excellent family entertainment achievement, with the keyword family, not just kids.; The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children's book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die! Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter  I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families.  \n",

                                                                                               Grumpier Old Men Too Sedate *; While Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were an excellent team, they bombed in this film but good. What's so grumpy about Lemmon in this film? The prequel was much better. Ann Guilbert, as Sophia Loren's mother, is given little to do. Remember her as the grandmother to \"The Nanny?\" Sophia Loren, other than marrying Matthau, is also give nothing to do. Ditto for Ann-Margret, Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak, all of whom were so good in the original but are reduced to practically nothing here. I also resent Matthau, who shows off his part-Jewish heritage marrying in a church at the end. I found this to be offensive. Sorry, but that's the way I am-old fashioned. To all those criticize me for the last statement, how would you have felt if the Matthau-Loren nuptials had taken place in a synagogue? While I realize that this was a comedy, this still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. A non-religious setting would have been the only solution to this. Grumpy, but not funny; What, I wonder, does the legendary Billy Wilder think of this film starring Lemmon and Matthau, the great team he so memorably paired in 1966's \"The Fortune Cookie\"?  Wilder's film is a dark, cynical satire, and was the first of what is now seven films starring the pair.  Seven films, but only two of them--\"The Fortune Cookie\" and \"The Odd Couple\"--are genuinely funny efforts showcasing these actors' combined talents.  \"Grumpy Old Men\" was mildly amusing due less to the script than to the welcome return of Lemmon and Matthau who hadn't been on screen together in 12 years.  The unexpected box-office bonanza naturally inspired a sequel, but all this equally lucrative outing has in its favor is a brief monologue by Burgess Meredith who, as Lemmon's 95-year-old father, boasts of eating bacon and smoking Camels while the \"experts\" who warned against such vices are taking a \"dirt nap.\"  Not even Lemmon and Matthau can enliven the script by Mark Steven Johnson this time around.  The curmudgeonly Matthau admitted he didn't lke the script for the first film but did it to work with Lemmon, and that the only reason he did the sequel is because the first film was a hit.  No doubt, \"Grumpiest Old Men,\" the inevitable sequel, will be just as dreary. If these pictures make big bucks, why tamper with the formula?  Why hire Billy Wilder to punch up the quality when the public seems content merely to see Lemmon and Matthau rather than see them at their best? Who would have ever guessed that it's the same place?; For the most part, \"Grumpier Old Men\" is pretty silly. Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still at each other's throats when Italian immigrant Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in town and throws everything into flux. What actually struck me most about the movie was how different the town looked in this one from the original. Obviously, it was a different time of year, but maybe the different look was meant to show how everything might be changing in the town. Other than that, Ann-Margret returns as Ariel, and she's still as free-spirited and vivacious as she was in the original. Burgess Meredith - in his final role - is still the grandfather who can exercise absolute authority over the youngsters, although he now has the hots for Maria's mother (Ann Morgan Guilbert, aka Millie on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\"). Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah also reprise their roles from the original...ah, and there's that fish. All in all, a fairly interesting movie. Not any kind of masterpiece, but it showed that Lemmon and Matthau still had it. Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. after you have seen the first there is no point seeing this one; After the fun of watching Lemmon and Matthau act like kids for less than 2 hours (i.e. from the first movie) I was satisfied, but then due to the success of the first movie the producers decided to give it another twirl, this time the story had the two starting off as friends thanks to the incidents that happened in the ending of the first film, but then some really really idiotic stupid reason, they were at it again. The movie was not funny as it was like a replay of the first, same pranks, similar plot and screenplay made this movie a waste of time. After getting a mate for John, they (the producers) decided to get a mate for Max, with nothing to write home about but a lame script that just showed no finesse or true plan, just the producers hoping to bank on the success of the previous movie. The main disappointment in the movie for me was Sophia Loren; her acting was just too weak for me to understand that she is a star. Everybody else in the movie even Burgess Meredith (who had Alzheimer's disease and this was his last motion picture appearance) was impressive, at least that I can give them. The movie is directed this time by Howard Deutch, who later worked with the duo in 1998 for Odd Couple II, Deutch other movies also have not been well received like Getting Even with Dad (1994) and The Whole Ten Yards (2004), which are basically the reason why I will not bother seeing My Best Friend's Girl. The movie plot carries on 6 months after the incidents of the first, where both John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) were getting prepared for the wedding of their children. Then a new arrival in town a beautiful lady by the name of Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) came in to change things by turning the towns bait shop to a restaurant. John and Max join forces to try and run the new lady out of town, but the issues between John and Max's children marriage plan caused both to reignite their feud as both refused to believe that their child was at fault. Only the ladies are alive till today (February 2013), as both Lemmon and Matthau died like half a decade after this movie release. Grumpier Old Men was a box office success in its own part, but a huge critical disappointment, as the movie cost 10 million dollars less than its predecessor and made like a million more in the box office. After you have seen the first there is basically no point why you should bother seeing this one, because it will stand in my mind as one movie I credit as a waste of time and talent. www.lagsreviews.com forget the fussing; As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Funnier than the first!; This movie is downright hilarious with tons of good one-liners. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (may they both rest in peace) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max & John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says \"Holy moly\" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor! Sophia, twenty years later at 80, is still spectacular.; I saw a picture of Sophia on her eightieth birthday, demurely covering herself with a sheet and a heart-melting smile. All I could think of was the scene where she hitched up her bra and marched through the bar, and every man looked, and I do mean every man. I read later that she had \"improved\" the script for that. A reviewer in the SF Chronicle wrote later that she said she had had no \"touch- ups\", and if so then \"her genes need investigating.\" I remember her many films where her beauty was so natural that it was a wonder any man could concentrate on his lines. She never traded on it, but on her talent as an actress. Carlo Ponti was a lucky man: beauty without guile, talent without pretense. Italian pizza were like street food. When she heard we had so many pizza parlors, she thought we must be a poor country. Then she visited, and dined on American pizza. She reconsidered, gracefully and graciously. A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances...; A sequel to the thoroughly enjoyable Grumpy Old Men, 'Grumpier Old Men' is A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances. The sequel has the spirit of its prequel & the amazing cast, led by the impeccable talents of the Late/Great Jack Lemmon & the Late/Great Walter Matthau, are in full form! 'Grumpier Old Men' Synopsis: John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. 'Grumpier Old Men' works well as a romantic-comedy, as it has moments of humour & subtle romance. I loved the prequel & I must say, the sequel doesn't fail to deliver. The film has sustained its energy & wit, that one would expect from it. Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is entertaining, although initially the pace is slightly slow. Howard Deutch's Direction is top-class. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is good. Editing also is ably done. Performance-Wise: Lemmon & Matthau shine all through. Its their sheer on-screen chemistry, that alone is worth watching the entire film. Sophia Loren is top-notch. Ann-Margret is impressive. Kevin Pollak & Daryl Hannah leave a mark. Late/Great Burgess Meredith is memorable in his part. On the whole, 'Grumpier Old Men' is a smooth, relaxing watch. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10 Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from 1995. The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe 8yrs old, and must have seen it over 100 x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it 15 minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in 1995, 2 years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie 8 out of 10. Mini Ha Has In Minnesota; It's just possible that the intention was to shoot four Grumpy Old Men titles featuring the four seasons because after the Winter setting of the first one we are now in Summer though theoretically such a cycle should have begun with Spring and ended with Winter so maybe the cyclical thing was an afterthought. Whatever we have virtually the same cast doing virtually the same thing with one absentee and two replacements one of which, Anna Guilbert is actually a native of Minneapolis adding a touch of authenticity. If it was unrealistic that Ann Margaret - who, after all, was teaching English at university and would by definition have access to dozens of eligible males - would marry Jack Lemmon in the first film it is equally unrealistic that Sophia Loren would wed Walter Mattheau here other than for feelgood reasons. On the other hand it's probably churlish to nitpick in this way when the film is only intended to entertain. Which it does. great; This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa As Good As The Original; Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\". I don't agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love \"Buddy Buddy\" and \"The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile. very funny.; This film has some of the funniest lines and it's a great comedy. One would probably think, even I, thought that this would probably happen between two older men who fight about the obvious: women, fish and each other. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are a perfect pair. Even though it's a comedy, the romance in it is on the clean side. Nothing too distasteful and the comic relief is still included into the romance, which gives it a continuous comic flow. Even though there is a serious part of the film where John's father passes away, after that scene the film is back to the comic feel, which is nice because there's no dwelling on the sad/serious scene. Nonetheless, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh hard. Sweet and Sad; In this bright sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\" we find John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) at it again. The rivalry never stops. This time, they are bickering over their children's nuptials, almost causing a wedding not to occur. Sophia Loren co-stars as Maria in this foray into the land of 10,000 lakes as the new girl in town that Max has an eye for. At first, they both hate one another because she is turning his beloved tackle shop into a restaurant. Comedy ensues as Max and John both try to get the restaurant shut down and condemned. Eventually, as in the first film, love finds a way. However, sadness veils over as well when Burgess Meredith's character dies. Other than that, the film is very enjoyable. Cute sequel that works; Fun story of two older men who never quite outgrew boyhood, and the ladies they love. What a treat to see two master actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, working with silly material and enjoying every minute of it. The lady loves, Ann Margret and the ever-sexy and dazzling Sophia Loren, do equally well with a lightweight, sometimes over-the-top script. The principals are aided by a uniformly fine supporting cast, including Burgess Meredith as the Lemmon character's outrageously lecherous dad, and Ann Morgan Guilbert as Sophia's feisty mama. The older players' interaction is a delight. My only quibble with this film is the fact that Meredith's character dies without getting married like everyone else. Why? I wondered whether Meredith had perhaps expired during filming, but, according to Wikipedia, the actor lived a whole two years following this movie's release! The original film, \"Grumpy Old Men,\" takes place during a picturesque Minnesota winter, with snow used to charming effect. The follow-up capitalizes on a Midwestern summer. Like apples and oranges, both productions satisfy. the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. 2/5 stars - John Ulmer Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! The good, the bad, and the just plain miserable...again; It's not uncommon for a movie sequel to do little to the formula that made its predecessor so financially (and hopefully critically) successful. The old \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" method of filmmaking has been used in the Hangover, Home Alone, and Taken franchise to only modest success in terms of quality. However, in Grumpier Old Men, the sequel to the fine comedy Grumpy Old Men, handles the rehashed formula better than many film sequels do. While I'm getting to sound repetitive and out of descriptive words, this is largely because of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's chemistry together on-screen. From the moment they appear, it's almost impossible to believe the men's friendship in real life wasn't lifelong and consisted largely of playful torment, vulgarity, and several boys nights out. Had the film been a sequel with few returning cast members (say Lemmon and Matthau were substituted by two other actors), this sequel would've likely been a somber affair to view. In a way, I'm thankful the town of Wabasha Minnesota hasn't really changed much since our last outing, with the exception of John Gustafson (Jack Lemon) marrying Ariel (Ann-Margret) from the original film. In the meantime, John's dad still lives off a diet of beer, cigarettes, and bacon and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), John's cantankerous neighbor, still finds himself engaging in petty neighborhood battles with John about outwitting the other man. However, the big ordeal this time is not competing for a new neighbor's love but trying to save a local bait shop from becoming a \"restaurante\" for Italian cuisine. The restaurant is managed by Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren), a gorgeous but uncompromisingly strict woman who catches the eye of Max even as him and Jack plan to foil the restaurant's forthcoming prosperity. Other events (aka subplots) occurring in Wabasha are the wedding between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah), a plot which would later be used by the same director Howard Deutch in The Odd Couple II, also starring Lemmon and Matthau, along with John trying to get his father (Burgess Meredith in his final role, which was burdened by spouts with Alzheimer's and difficultly remembering lines, some female company as he gets older. One of Grumpier Old Men's immediate issues is that there is simply too much going on between plot-strands that involve marriage/romance troubles (I counted four including John's brief trouble with Ariel later in the movie) ad others that involve trying to sabotage the bait-shop-turned-restaurant. Grumpier Old Men may have too many new ideas for cutesy subplots, but it keeps the tone and feel of its predecessor alive and well. It still feels like Wabasha is the location of a sitcom with its oddball situations that seem to consistently bear hefty consequences for its residents, but its characters still feel like real people we've come to known and care about. Unsurprisingly, Lemmon and Matthau share unbelievable conversational beauty in the way they engage in simple discussions that seem to constantly end in uproariously funny bickering. Once you minimize your focus on that aspect in the film, you have just an average comedy that, while charming and pleasantly safe (a good and bad quality for this particular kind of picture), is just grateful to be buoyed by two very talented leading men. Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Sophia Loren, and Burgess Meredith. Directed by: Howard Deutch. A vibrant sequel that's still underwhelming; I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They seem to work perfectly together, and with a better script, this movie could be gold. We are taken back to Minnesota to re-visit the old grumps who now have to plan a wedding for their very plain and very boring children. There's a reason Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah have never had substantial film careers- they're very uninteresting actors. But I digress. If \"Grumpy Old Men\" built up it's laughs, \"Grumpier Old Men\" topples them down. The best moments of both films are when Lemmon and Matthau trade vicious insults at one another, and also play pranks on each other. But when this is taken away, we're suffering every old cliché in the book, including Walter's tiresome 'Wholey Moley' line which is used so much, it could be taken into context for a Shot Party (take a shot every time Matthau 'Wholey Moley''s himself). The other problem with this series is the fact that gorgeous women fall for these two farts. Roger Ebert made a very valid point in his review for this film- first Ann-Margaret moves into the neighborhood and marries Jack Lemmon. Now the even more gorgeous Sophia Loren has set her sights on the incredibly unattractive Matthau. And why? For concepts in the plot. There's no reason a woman as beautiful and intelligent as Loren would fall for the dull and disgusting figure Matthau is. I know this is a comedy, but come on now! All in all this sequel is peppier and a little more fun then the original, but both movies suffer from overblown dramatic passages that are not needed. We want to see the old guys go at it, not Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah. I laughed a lot at this movie- mostly at the incredibly underrated Bergis Meredith as the foul-mouthed Grandpa. Since all three main actors have passed, we'll never see them again. At least Margaret and Loren are still alive and kicking. I'd love to see their movie: \"Grumpy Old Widows\". The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5. Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. not much fun; Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still combative while maintaining their truce. John is married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) now and his father (Burgess Meredith) is still spry. Everybody is chasing after the big fish Catfish Hunter. Meanwhile, their children Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are planning to get married. Newcomer Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in Wabasha to buy the bait shop and turn it into an Italian restaurant. It's a continuation that's missing much of the fun. It is contrived. It's great to see these great actors working together but that's all I got out of it. I found very few laughs. Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. Back For More!; CONTAINS SPOILERS John Gustafson and Max Goldman are back in their first adventure since their last. It's six months later and they're still fishing. All the snow has melted and the neighborhood looks very different. The boys are out to catch a giant legendary fish they've heard tell about.          These men would soon discover big changes happening. Like, their friend Chuck, who died in the last adventure, had operated the bait shop. Ever since his demise, it's been empty, but some people have come with plans to turn it into a ristorante (restaurant). They are: Mama Regetti and daughter Maria. John and Max don't want that to happen so they pull numerous pranks on the Regettis but they still won't leave.         Jacob Goldman and Melanie Gustafson contemplate matrimony. But have their doubts when their fathers insist on planning the event. But when the kids decide the wedding is off, John and Max are back at it. Pulling all sorts of foolish pranks on one another. Max steals John's outboard motor, John wrecks Max's fish net and has his cat scratch up Max's car seats, but Max sends a big dog through John's house. Ariel decides to leave for a while. John was in a real pickle. He tried asking his father for advice, but he had passed away; Max goes on a date with Maria and they decide they like one another.        Pretty soon, it's a wedding day. En route to the church, Max and John decide to fish for the giant musket they're so fond of. They catch it, but John says they must leave it in the lake out of respect for his father, so they do and rush to church. It looks like the wedding of Jacob and Melanie, but it isn't. They eloped. It's the wedding of Max and Maria. John planted Max's dog in the limo as they drive off.        Was this as good as the first? Sure. I'm sorry to say that the three main stars, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith are no longer with us. Meredith died in 1998, Matthau in 2000 and Lemmon in 2001, which is real sad. So it's guarenteed there will never be an Even Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple III. They were really funny men. Why do the good ones always gotta die? But anyway, if you're a fan of these men and you enjoyed the first one, then I recommend Grumpier Old Men! - Still having a good ol' time!; I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men back to back, so I could see both instead of my normal rent one sequel at a time ordeal. I just finished Grumpier Old Men this morning and was expecting a modest sequel, but it turned into a great sequel, pretty much to the point where I enjoyed Grumpier Old Men to Grumpy Old Men. Despite the fact that they use some old jokes, this was a fun plot and I thought the guys have gotten even funnier, including John's father, he's a little dirty, but so much fun to laugh at. John and Max are now best friends again and couldn't be happier with each other, their son and daughter are about to get hitched, and they are overwhelming with the wedding plans. Max is starting to get lonely though, since Chuck has passed on, the bait shop is given to two older Italian women, one lady, Maria, starts a little feud with Max wanting to turn the bait shop into a restaurant. But their anger turns into a hidden passion and they end up falling head over heals for each other, but Maria has some hidden skeletons in her closet. Grumpier Old Men is proof that you are never too old to fall in love or have your heart broken again. It was so sweet seeing Max fall in love with Maria, I loved their passion for each other, it was so fun to watch. John's father and Maria's mother were just so awesome and funny, they had such great chemistry! I would highly recommend Grumpier Old Men, it's a great comedy that once again touches your heart and tickles your funny bone. 8/10 1/10; this movie sucked! I hate it! It's so boring! The acting is so bad! Why does Sophia Loren's italian character talk english to her italian mother when they're alone? The script is so bad! It's so corny! Max and John fighting with the fishing things is so silly! This movie was never funny! It was painful to watch, i'm telling you! Avoid it! Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter & Jack's previous films together. It was this film & the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max & John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life & Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau & Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman & John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a 7.4 out of 10 Snoozing sequel with the leads in need of some No-Doz; Woeful, disappointing sequel to 1993's hit \"Grumpy Old Men\" is more retread than follow-up. The two crotchety neighbors--Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--bicker over their children (who will soon be making the sparring oldsters in-laws!) and, of course, who has the better fishing skills. They stop trading insults long enough for Matthau to begin irritating a new woman in town, a fiery Italian who has just opened her own restaurant. Sitcom humor with a sometimes-raunchy twist that is no longer fresh. Almost worth-seeing for Sophia Loren's funny, lively performance, but everyone else looks a little sleepy. Ann-Margret (who married Lemmon's character at the end of the original) must've dropped in for a day and a half to complete her work. As the youthful couple, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah are also under-used. ** from **** As equally funny as the original, but with an Italian flair!!!!; This sequel to Grumpy Old Men is as funny as the original. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and the rest of the cast from the original movie reprise their roles. John and Max are still feuding, but the tension between them has softened. There are, however, some changes: Ariel and John are married and there's a new girl in town named Maria Ragetti. She's moved to Wabasha to open up an Italian restaurant at the former Chuck's Bait place. When the boys discover what Maria's intentions are, they hatch a scheme to ruin the grand opening of the restaurant and try to keep Chuck's business going, even though the inventory of the former business has been cleared out and the interior remodeled to look like an Italian restaurant. Max and Sophia meet, but there's a disagreement about what the place should be. Maria goes to the neighborhood bar to try and reason with Max, but to no avail. It seems as though Max and John have trouble saying goodbye to what is no longer there. The humor between Lemmon and Matthau's characters is still spiced up and is still able to put viewers in stitches. Then, Max and Maria get married, and the restaurant starts selling bait, as well. Great movie, great cast, great fun!! Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) funny funny; I, too, found the film very funny and until reading about it here couldn't remember who played the other woman with Burgess Meredith at the end of the film, the scene that made the whole film complete.  Without giving away what happened at the end of the film, the other woman was that gorgeous elder lady of many great films - Sophia Loren.  What a delicious surprise!  Good also for any old grumpy man! Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. 7/10 stars. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT 7 out of 10 \"Good Lemmon & Matthau Comedy Sequel!\"; Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Kevin Pollack, Daryl Hannah and Burgess Meredith star in this 1995 comedy sequel. This takes place about 6 months later where John (Lemmon) is now married to Ariel (Margret) and he and Max (Matthau) are sort of getting along. This time, Max finds romance when he meets Maria Ragetti (Loren), an Italian widow who moves into town and opens a restaurant. Jacob (Pollack) and Melanie (Hannah) are also engaged and things start to get a bit difficult for them which makes their dads feud with each other, but only temporarily. The late, Meredith (Rocky) also returns as John's father and this was his final film. This is a good sequel and like the first film, it provides laughs and a bit of heartfelt moments as well. I recommend this. Oh, How The Mighty Have Fallen...; GRUMPY OLD MEN (3 outta 5 stars) GRUMPIER OLD MEN (2 outta 5 stars) I dunno why I even bothered to watch the second one. Oh, I guess because it was on cable TV shown as a double bill with the original \"Grumpy Old Men\". I liked the original when I first saw it. It was not the best work by the Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau team... but it had its moments... these two actors could probably read pages from the phone book to each other and still make it funny. Unfortunately, the sequel has even FEWER of those moments. Still, I maintain that no movie with either Lemmon OR Matthau in it can be *totally* worthless. This is probably as close as they ever got, though. (Bear in mind that I have not yet seen their last movie together, \"The Odd Couple II\".) Practically the same plot as the first movie... Lemmon and Matthau play lifelong acquaintances and next door neighbors who are constantly bickering about fish and/or women. Burgess Meredith plays Lemmon's FATHER... and if you find old people talking dirty hilarious then you'll probably love his scenes (especially in the closing credits outtakes). Ann Margaret and Sophia Loren play the women in the grumpy guys' lives... hard to imagine that women as attractive as they still are would want anything to do with these two old dorks but, hey... I guess pickings are slim after 65. Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. A sequel that's equal to the original comedy; The first go round was such a hit, that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau got together for this sequel to the 1993 smash hit, \"Grumpy Old Men.\" And \"Grumpier Old Men\" is every bit as good as the first film. It has some new characters and the scene changes from winter to summer, then winter and spring. Most reviewers don't talk about the surprise of the wedding in the first film. And I won't do that for that film or this one. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) team up for a time in the movie to plan the wedding of their daughter and son, Melanie and Jacob (played by Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak). And, later, to try to thwart the conversion of their bait shop into an Italian restaurant. Sophia Loren is the added ingredient for much humor as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti. She's a cousin of \"Spaghetti\" Ragetti, whom John and Max know. Her mother is in the picture, Mama Ragetti, played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. And, grandpa Gustafson is back, with Burgess Meredith now a couple years older. He tells son, John, as they sit by the lake drinking beer, that he sometimes thinks God has forgotten about him. The hijinks and capers in this film include some hilarious pranks the two friendly enemies pull on the Ragettis. As with the original film, this one supposedly takes place in Wabasha, Minnesota. While it is a real town on the Mississippi River border with Wisconsin, the filming for this and the earlier movie was done in a number of places around that area of southeastern Minnesota. So, anyone going to Wabasha won't find the fishing lake, the town overlook or some other scenes shown in these films. With the 10 films they made together  especially the nine comedies, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have delighted audiences for decades. May they outlive Catfish Hunter and continue amuse people for decades to come. OLDER, HORNIER AND STILL FRUSTRATED IN MINNESOTA;  `Grumpier Old Men' is a film that is a sequel to `Grumpy Old Men.' Reprising their original roles are Jack Lemmon as John Gustafson, Walter Matthau as Max Goldman, Ann Margaret as Ariel, Burgess Meredith as John's father, Kevin Pollock and Darryl Hannah as the children of Max and John. They are still next-door neighbors, only now the feud has subsided. Their children are living across the street in Ariel's house.  The marriage of their children is on the horizon. The setting for this film is summer and fall in Minnesota.  Fishing is still the main sport where `Catfish Hunter' is still the elusive prize.  The bait shop on the lake has been closed since Chuck passed away.  It is now under new management.  John and Max are anxiously waiting the reopening.  To their surprise, it is not being reopened as a bait shop, but a ristorante (restaurant).  Here enters Sophia Loren as the new proprietress Maria Sophia Calotti Ragetti.  Ann Guilbert who plays her mother joins her.  When Max and John find out the new plans for their favorite bait shop, they set out to undermine her plans for a grand opening.  A series of misunderstandings set off a domino effect that touches everyone's lives.  New loves are found and an old feud is rekindled. All of the same emotions that were in the previous film are in this film. There is laughter, sadness, anger and happiness.  Catfish Hunter makes his film debut, which, in essence, puts a `face' with a name.  His film appearance pays credence to the fact that he is a `real' fish and not just a myth.   The acting in this film is superb both by human and non-human.  The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down. Loren is still hot; Grumpy old men was an OK comedy with a nice performance by Ann-Margret, but otherwise forgettable. This film, on the other hand, has some real comic touches that actually also have something to say about the aging process - and life really doesn't end until it ends. But first the bad news: Daryl Hannah. I've liked her in other films, but she is so flat in this, she's a distraction. She doesn't have the feel for these characters, not even her own, and so doesn't quite fit. She's not even credible as the mother of the young girl who is so important in her relationship to great=grand-dad Burgess Meredith. There must have been some plot device they could have come up with to leave her out of the picture altogether; oh, well. Now the really good news: Sophia Loren. I admit I have always had a crush on her since I saw Houseboat as a kid; and when I saw the shower scene in Arabesque, i couldn't sleep for a week. Her performance here is splendid (romantic comedy is one of her strengths, after all), but the really really good news is that she was past sixty when she made this film, and she looks hot enough to burn a young man's fingers! Really - if I'd been Walter Matthau in that bar scene, I'd have gone out with a heart-attack right there - and smiling. With an adequate script, and such superb actors, Deutsch wisely lets the formula roll on without interference. Consequently, whatever the short-comings there's plenty to remember fondly from this film. Oh, and don't miss the blooper-reel that runs under the final credits - Matthau and Meredith are having a grand old time. Oh, and Sophia Loren is still hot. Grumpier Old Men (1995) **1/2; More of the same for those who enjoyed the first film, nothing great but a decent time killer. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return in their twilight years as the ever-battling duo, but this time with the added attraction of Sophia Loren who still looks gorgeous at age 60. She winds up posing a threat to their favorite bait and tackle shop when she decides to take it over and turn it into an Italian restaurant. Since Lemmon's already got sexy Ann-Margret as his hot girlfriend, Sophia hits it off with old man Matthau (ah, the magic of movies), who does not look as good for his age (75). Burgess Meredith is better used in this one in his role as Lemmon's naughty old pop. **1/2 out of **** charming and funny light romantic comedy; It may be just me but I found Grumpier Old Men way way better than Grumpy Old Men. I laughed more and got involved in the plot much more. That it is totally 100% predictable every step of the way is only one of its charms... its how you get there where the fun is. And these actors turn in surprisingly memorable performances for such a slight film. I thought Sophia Loren turned in one of her most charming and funny performances, as did everyone else. The story was just more interesting and three dimensional than the first film and flowed more organically. The story line is simple ancient classic romantic comedy that these veterans had done so many times, it seemed for them like doing a well-known dance. The fun is not in surprises but in going through the old steps with joy. The actors move through their paces with simplicity and enthusiasm and the film actually captures very well the effects of love. The whole film hangs together and works in a way that, for me, the first one didn't. It gets airborne. It deserves a higher ranking than my seven except the story is a little too well-worn. It also allows the two protagonists to get a little more real with each other. Even the three charismatic animal actors get caught up in the spirit of fun. One thing about the film that gave me trouble was that all four women being courted in the film are talented, accomplished, strong and magnificent while all four of the men are hamstrung. I found it mysterious that these women, dropped by some miracle into this tiny town, would be so strongly attracted. Pretty Dang Funny; John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. We often expect sequels to be weaker than the original. But sometimes we may be pleasantly surprised. In this sequel, the \"grumpy old men\" are still up to their old tricks, going after each other and teaming up to close down a restaurant. Some of it may be a bit far-fetched (in real life, a store owner would get the cops involved) but it's good fun. Sadly, the film has the distinction of being Burgess Meredith's final film. On the plus side, he really goes out with a bang. His acting and delivery of witty lines is top notch, and the film does a great job of hiding his Alzheimer's. You can really feel the talent in his character. It has it's moments; Howard Deutch decided he wanted to cash in on the success of Grumpy Old Men and it worked. The only problem to the sequel is that some of the cast seem to be a bit bored by the proceedings. The one liners are enough to make you drop your popcorn. Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon are a joy to watch as they continue to find ways to drive each other over the edge into insanity. And yet Deutch calms that insanity by giving us a quick glimpse into just how much these two men mean to each other when Jack's dad played by Burgess Meredith dies. Lemmon and Mathau are still at the top of their game in this film. In this film the Ann Margaret character is suppose to be the rock, the sound of reason, the calm in the midst of the storm. You believe she is until she has the insanity thrust upon her and is forced to react. For the most part Ann Margaret as well as Daryl Hannah seem bored throughout the entire film. Kevin Pollack is just as good in this sequel as in the original. Burgess Meredith is the scene stealer, he manages with dead pan accuracy to deliver some of the best one liners in the film. Ann Morgan Guilbert manages to match Burgess with her ability to respond to his one liners with shock and outrage befitting her character. And then you come to Sophia. Sophia is in her comfort zone here. Sophia is comfortable with the slapstick comedy and relishes it, she's in the movie, she's not walking through it. She's absolutely stunning to watch but at the same time she adds to the moment. She's as glamorous as ever but it doesn't get in the way. All in all a good follow up to the original. Good Laughs; Grumpier Old Men (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to Grumpy Old Men have Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau returning with more fights and foul language. This time out Lemmon is still happily married but Matthau is on the move and takes a special interest in an Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved to town. I think the most remarkable thing about this film is how well Loren looked. Even at 61 she's still a head turner and her comic timing isn't too bad either. I'm sure this film was only made because the first one made money but it doesn't really matter as no one should take this too serious as it's just a silly comedy meant to make you laugh. There are plenty of nice laughs here but I don't think it's as good as the original. This certainly isn't in the league as The Odd Couple but we do get a pretty good throwback to that film here as there's a scene where Lemmon has to spend the night with Matthau but can't put up with his dirty house. Ann-Margret returns but is pretty much wasted as is Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak. The perverted Burgess Meredith is back and steals the scene every time he's in it. Both Matthau and Lemmon are naturally very good and they easily slip back into their roles. It's priceless watching the two men work together even when the material isn't as strong as one would hope. Lemmon gets a special notice here due to a very touching scene with Meredith. Another problem is the direction, which has one of those \"made for TV\" feels to it. In the end this film could have and should have been a lot better but the cast make it worth watching. Delightful acting and script but silly scenes...; Always delighting in Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, warmed by their aging and childish pranks, I enjoyed this film which is filled with delightful acting and fun script.It suffers, however,  from more than a few silly scenes. Great!; This is a rare sequel. Wait a minute, sequels aren't rare. Well, that's true, but a *good* sequel is rare. Most of the time, sequels aren't even in the same league as the originals. However, due to excellent writing, a superb cast and great direction, this film is every bit as enjoyable as Grumpy Old Men. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made several films together and they worked together extremely well. The gorgeous Ann Margaret reprises her role from the first film and is now Lemmon's wife. A new lady hits town and Matthau is very interested. This lovely creature is played by Sophia Loren, who is still stunningly beautiful. Burgess Meredith is great as Grandpa. The stellar cast ensures great acting. However, this film is also written such that there is literally a laugh nearly every minute. I found the film to be highly enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh. Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the 1st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. One of the best movies of 1995!; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Is it better than original?; Is this movie better than the original? Perhaps. It's probably funnier than the original. Walter Matthau's pick-up line is one of the funniest things of the movie. But is it better than the original? The original had more of the emotions of Lemmon and Matthau as they fought. This one has less feuding (but still has some of the old pranks) and more focus on the family / dating relationships of the old men. This movie is funny and definitely worth watching. You'll have to decide on your own if it's better than the original.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Excellent for the broken heart...; Perhaps the reason they call this movie a chick flick, is because that's exactly who it's aimed at. Women. I don't see this as a man bashing movie, but more as a \"how do you deal?\" type of movie. It covers every situation: The unworthy co-worker, The drug-addict boyfriend, the gay husband, the cheating husband, the married man, the New Years fling, the sweet attractive neighbor, the teenage son....but most importantly, it show how women react and deal with the lies, the cheating, and the friendships between both men AND women...and how to survive from that. Any woman who has ever gone through a relationship can relate to this movie, regardless of race, situation, or age. You will want to scream, cry and laugh throughout the whole movie, and I can guarantee that every woman has got a little Angela Bassett in her, especially when she rips through her ex-husbands belongings. Two thumbs up...A definite must-see for any woman with a wounded heart. This film does Terry McMillan's writing no justice; This movie had great potential had it landed in the right directors hands (as seen with How Stella got Her Groove Back).  Many rough cuts, sloppy editing, and terrible lighting at times to name a few.  Casting was excellent with the exception of Whitney Houston who has the tendency to over-chew her scenes.  Though much of the book was not adapted to the film the strength and love amongst four friends was apparent.  It was the one thing that was not lost or left on the cutting room floor.  Good movie, better book. Waiting to Exhale (the movie) ***** (5 stars) Waiting to Exhale (the novel) ********** (ten stars) FAbuLOuS; Simply fabulous. I thought it was a great movie. I was completely empowered! It made me want to start my exes car on fire. Embrace your independence  watch this movie. (is great to watch with the scorned over glasses of wine and bon bons) It'll make you laugh, cry, get mad, and then plot getting even. I can waste a lot of your time telling you to see it, defending it from what others say about it, or just generally talking it up. But haven't you always wanted to see Angela Basset throw a fit? How bout cut her hair off? And who wouldn't want to watch Whitney act with humility. This is by far my favorite movie with Whitney - second, The Bodyguard - third, The Preachers Wife. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Pathetic; This film is simply about a bunch of women who pick men who's behaviors they claim to hate & then spend the rest of their time complaining about them. It seems that this view is held by many women & possibly accounts in some measure to the number of women who consider their relationships with men to be unsatisfying. This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation. Hilarious in Parts; 1995 was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in 1995, the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops & horrible movies. Don't Exhale Just Yet; I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It's not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others, it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However, the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria -- even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger, Holly Hunter, Alfre Woodard and others. Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight, insecure no-nonsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight, but she was the only one who found it (and deserved it). She was the only one who didn't sleep around, wasn't a man basher, set a good example for her son, and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face -- look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things, her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent, good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie. Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package --- beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life - she could now start her catering business, she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end. Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book, you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men. Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same -- Whitney Houston being well groomed, pretending to be well spoken and classy, and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise (although she might have been too young). The character had to tell us she was smart -- in a phone conversation with her mother she said \"I'm smart, I'm a good person and I work hard.\" Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills, doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end. This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn't \"tell this story\" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were. Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue? Double Standard; So I finally got around to watching \"Waiting to Exhale\" on Encore the other night and I don't understand why this became a hit. (Note: spoilers ahead) As far as I can tell, the basic premise of this film is that all men are insensitive, callous and unfeeling; especially towards women. Okay, well and good. That is the storyline? Fine. Men suck, got it. But there is a huge double standard here; two of the women are dating married men and clearly, we are meant to be sympathetic about their plight as they whine and cry about not having \"their\" man with them at night in bed. How about this? STOP DATING MARRIED MEN! Maybe that's your problem in the first place. Now, on the flip side, Angela Basset's character is abandoned by her husband for another woman. Yet, if you pay attention, even this character is not completely innocent. When her husband informs her he is leaving, the things she says makes it clear she's known about his lover(s) for years but ignored his infidelities. Why? Obviously, because he's so wealthy. She liked all the \"stuff\" a little too much to have confronted him about it. Again, she's made her bed here, not as completely as the two who are actively cheating, but still. She spends the rest of the movie being so angry that he left her you never really grow to like her. Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer; he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar. With their clothes on, which apparently means it's oh-so-platonic and sweet. Then he writes her a letter months later, thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off, he'll contact her again. Did anyone else think this was more than a little sleazy? I would hope if I were dying of breast cancer that my husband wasn't out sleeping around (and I do mean just sleeping) with other women. Sweet, platonic, whatever; I think it's pretty horrible. Bottom line; the characters you're supposed to connect to are unlikable and the ones you're supposed to hate are just pathetic. Not very enjoyable. However, I did give it three stars for the music, which didn't suck too badly and the clothes and style. It's a nice little snapshot of how things looked in '95. And the print wasn't very faded. That's about it, though. Extra in Movie; I was actually an extra in this movie and had a quite a fun time hanging out w/the cast/crew. I had an opportunity to be at several of the locations for days of filming and it was a lot of work. You don't realize what a day of filming entitles until you actually do it and I was just an extra. I was more interested in the process of the film making than being on camera so it was a great opportunity. I even got \"spoiled\" and met a lot of the cast and drove around in the SUV's that are for the main cast...fun stuff! I think over all the movie was to enjoy for fun. I think the basis of the friendships were the most important aspect of the film. That through all the craziness of men in their lives they were still there for one another. This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Good movie, Better book; This wasn't a bad movie. The acting was great (although Whitney Houston still seems mediocre). Some of the scenes were powerful and funny. However, unlike the book which also deals with the sisterhood of Black women, the movie becomes a long \"Men are pigs\" tirade that gets weary after a while. Plus it's sometimes hard to root for the characters. For instance, considering all the one-night stands Savannah has, it's hard to see why she's questioning her ability to find a good man. Overall, Waiting to Exhale, is basically a sorely-needed bonding movie for African-American women that, while a little biased, is good escapist fun. Sticky; There was nothing in the movie that made me excited. The message did not come through,  if there was one. Perhaps it is to convey the idea that men are useless,  or that relations are complicated because women make it complicated. If a comedy,  I did not laugh.  If a drama,  I did not find it dramatic. It was like drinking a cup of coffee presented to you with way too much sugar. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. Whitney ruined the great potential; Angela Basset was good as expected, but Whitney has no Range as an actress. The screenplay also neglected to portray, on film, the greatness of this novel.  Instead of promoting sisterhood, they emphasized the canine-qualities of men.  Read the book; rent Soul Food instead! Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. I wanna move to Arizona; I thought It was a great movie, although it is a lot of sleeping with other women husband that are taken, we all have to be honest, this goes on a lot in reality. it's not right, but it happens.... Overall I really enjoy the movie because it took me way back to 1995, the movie was great. great times, although I was just 11 when it came out, I remember all the hype over this movie from my mom n my aunts.... One factor that I've never notice before was the setting... It makes me wanna pack up my family an move to peaceful Arizona.. Great Movie. r.i.p. Whitney Houston I cannot believe it took me all this time to see this movie all the way through... Frustrating...; That's the word I'd use to describe the film, an adaptation of Terry McMillan's 1992 best-seller. It's not great, it's not bad, but it's frustrating to watch, and the fact that I'm of the male persuasion undoubtedly had something to do with it. Now, let me be the first to say that I did enjoy seeing a group of strong black women portrayed onscreen. To say that Hollywood has been exceedingly lax in this regard is an understatement. But it would've been nice if their collective talents hadn't been squandered on this disgustingly anti-male tirade. Especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine, who otherwise shine in everything their names are attached to. Good, solid movies about sisterhood are probably needed now more than ever, but not at the cost of shortchanging the good, upright, decent brothers out there, whom this movie largely forgets about (with some notable exceptions -- Gregory Hines, for example.) And the frustration doesn't end there. Both Savannah and Robin manage to find themselves involved with the most shady characters (a married man and a dope fiend, respectively), yet they complain about the lack of good men out there. I suppose it would be silly to question just where they've been looking, even though it might hold the answer. The sad thing is that there are fellas out there who have little to no regard for women (\"the scum of the f__king earth\", to quote Savannah), and women who fall for fellas like that for the most silly, shallow reasons. If it wasn't for Bassett, Devine, and Babyface's score, this movie would barely be watchable. As it is, it's a moderately entertaining diversion, albeit a frustrating one. A 3 is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. great touching story; While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life's mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Great female flick of the '90s!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track 6: This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! A real disaster!; This movie is awful! The caracters are shallow and almost ridiculous, especially Lela Rochon. It's a very, very, very bad soap opera. I was watching this movie with my wife and we were laughing almost all the time. It is much too long, with no rhythm with absolutely no emotions. It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one cliché after another. Skip it, it's a waste of time! The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" My favorite movie ever !; I'm so surprised by the comments i read here. Since i saw that movie maybe 10 years ago now, it's one of my favorite movie ever along with boomerang.Maybe it's because i was fairly young when i watched those movies.. but i find them extremely good. I watched the movie before i read the book and it may be the reason why i loved the movie so much. Sure Whitney's acting could have been better but she managed to do a pretty decent job overall. As for the soundtrack it's a pure bliss for RnB lovers and i would say a classic now. The image of Black men in the movie is very negative but in a sens it pushed to be the exact opposite so it kinda shaped my vision and my life, and \"deepend\" my love of black women. Some parts of the movie are just so classic like the break up between Robin and troy on the balcony and the soundtrack at that moment was some kind of a symphony.. anyways great great movie .. enjoy A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about 15 or 16 and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker. 6 of 10 stars. A bit too soapy but deserves respect for being a positive film for black women; Vannah is travelling to see her friend Bernie while leaving behind all her old live to start anew.  Bernie has just been left by her husband of 13 years for a white woman.  Robin wants to be loved and happy but always makes the wrong choices.  Glo has an estranged husband and the only man in her life is her teenage son.  The four get together through their struggles in love and live as they try to put it all together again. This is very much a woman's film and, as a man, it's easy for me to criticise it for being a weepy or for being a bit of a woman love in, so I won't.  The plot is pure soap opera, the lives and loves of our 4 women, however it is still involving as the four stories all have strengths as well as weaknesses.  The mix of comedy and sentiment is a bit too much 20:80 and at times the sentiment gets too much, but the sassy characters keep the interest. The soapy sentiment isn't helped by a poor soundtrack and poor use there of. In itself I like some of the love ballad r'n'b stuff  but here it felt like it was all over every scene.  This really bogs it down. Also a down side is the whole man hating thing  only a few come off looking good.  I thought the director being a man would help redress the balance but it seemed to have no effect. Why  can someone tell me  was Houston chosen to lead this talented black cast?  Was it because she could do a cut price soundtrack?  She's a poor actress and he spoiled her scenes  she needs to stay in TVM's.  Bassett however is powerful as ever and really steals every single scene she's in.  Devine adds comedy and sauce while Rochon is perfect as the vulnerable beauty going about love the wrong way.  The male cast is great too  there are so many well known faces in this with only two criticisms of them  1  everytime I see Haysbert now all I can think of is his 24 character.  And 2  Wesley Snipes' character just don't convince me at all. Overall to criticise this for being girly or sentimental is to miss the point.  It is actually good to see a film with so many good roles for black actresses.  It's a bit too soapy for my taste but it is funny and involving with a commanding Bassett.  Only Huston, a soppy soundtrack and constant man caricatures spoil it. WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. I give this one 2 out of 10. not bad; this movie and its story are quite good on the whole..........Ms Bassett is the leading and the best actress,for sure.I get her character.she's beautiful and I guess she's blown people away with her beauty and the EASE WITH WHICH SHE FASCINATES.Ms HOUSTON IS NOT TO NEGLECT NEITHER.She looks natural in this one.And despite her little experience as far as her actress career is concerned,she is good even though her story is a bit common .Loretta is divine!Anyways,this motion picture is merely good.There's nothing amazing.And it don't stand out from all the other movies.the only thing that makes me stick to the screen is the complicity and the crude humor on men of the four ladies! Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this 1995 film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. A One-Sided Celebration of African American Feminism; Directed by Forest Whitaker and adapted from a smash best selling novel by Terry McMillan, WAITING TO EXHALE is a glossy, but one-sided look at the relationship between four strong black women and the various men in their lives. The film is one-sided because the screenplay presents most of the male characters as sexist, manipulative pigs without a redeeming characteristic in sight, but the sensitive direction and outstanding performances keep the rather lopsided story watchable. Whitney Houston made an impressive film debut as Savannah, an ambitious television executive caught in a dead-end affair with a married man (Dennis Haysbert). Angela Basset does Oscar-worthy work as Bernadine, a woman who has spent her life being the best wife and mother she knows how to be, who has her world rocked when her wealthy husband (Michael Beach) calmly announces one night before a formal dinner party that he's in love with someone else and wants a divorce. The scene where Bernadine gathers all her husband's stuff and makes a bonfire out of it in her driveway is one of the film's highlights. Lela Rochon plays Robin, a not-too-bright doormat who finds herself pregnant by a man she wants nothing to do with. Loretta Devine is fun as Gloria, a hairdresser who is divorced from her husband, who it turns out was gay, and is struggling to raise her son (Donald Faison) and tries to begin a relationship with a new neighbor (Gregory Hines). If you can accept the fact that in the world of these four women, all men are pigs, then this film can be very entertaining but the top-notch performances by the cast cannot be overlooked. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Feel Good Movie; The acting in this film is phenomenal, especially on the part of Angela Bassett who always does an amazing job (see What's Love Got To Do With It). The inter-cuts work well where they are placed, much like all of the other shots, and keep the films pace and the viewer interested. I've read other user comments and I find their opinions to be completely biased and unwarranted. If you're watching this film looking for profound insight to life you will be disappointed. This film is an adaptation of Terry McMillan's critically acclaimed novel FOR BLACK FEMALES. Waiting to Exhale explores the lives of four female friends. Each woman makes mistakes and has to deal with those consequences. But it is through being there for one another that they overcome these problems and others. For me, most of the negative user comments are from people who the film was not made for, that are only analyzing the film from the story. There is more to a film than it's narrative and when base your full opinion on that alone you are missing out. Plus, for me, it's just flat-out annoying when people who are completely not the target audience bash a film. Note: this is not to say that art cannot breach color, age or sex barriers. But be let's be realistic for a moment. If say, a heterosexual, black, 21 year old female studying Art was asking you for a good movie suggestion for a Friday night...Would you suggest The Dukes Of Hazard? I think not. Not unless you were joking. Hot Soundtrack, Terrible Character Development; Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end.  It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.  However, much of this is wasted on poor character development.  Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover.  What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies.  While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all.  For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script.  Clearly the answer is that it isn't.  Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with.  Why the director didn't see this, I don't know. Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface. 4/10 Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" WAITING TO EXHALE : Waiting To Go Somewhere, But Sadly It Never Does...; WAITING TO EXHALE Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. \"Waiting To Exhale\", Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book, had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it's star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene. \"Waiting To Exhale\" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone. It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn't know the word \"feelings\" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change. For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they've experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don't seem to learn squat. It's like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. \"Waiting To Exhale\" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose. ... D ... Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life. Please. Sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE HARD TRUTH) looked VERY beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts REALLY made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Decent; Those of you who ranted and raved about how horrible this film was really tickle my funny bone. I love to see miserable people hate a movie just because...well, they have nothing to better to do. Not saying this was the best movie I've ever seen. But I agree with others who say that Bassett and Levine are the ones to save this film from drowning with all the other horrible movies. I love Angela Bassett, I'm a huge fan of hers. The scene which depicts the morning after her husband leaves her for his secretary, which would've otherwise been too cliché for my taste had it not been for the way Bernie (Bassett) burned up that BMW! I mean that was classic. Sorry if any of you testosterone-fueled men out there will accuse me of man hating, but I love that scene and will watch it over and over again. Three cheers for Angie. And Devine's character, Gloria seems sort of weak and unable to stand up to even her teenage son, but I love how she bends a little and confesses how she feels to the late Gregory Hines' character. You'll notice Devine's Gloria and Bassett's Bernie are slightly juxtaposed but their chemistry is excellent. If you haven't seen it, check it out, if not for anything but the performance of these two gifted actors. in response to your response; I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :)  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Entertaining, but the premise has been worn thin -- it's sweet, but unnecessary.; The original \"Father of the Bride\" with Spencer Tracey is a really good comedy, the remake starring Steve Martin is a good sweet-natured, amiable enough comedy - and I don't really think a sequel was necessary at all. I mean the whole premise is basically the same - before George Banks (Martin) had to grasp the reality of his daughter being married, and now he has to come to grips with the fact that she's having a baby. A nice twist on this is that his wife (played by Diane Keaton) is ALSO pregnant, but nevertheless it's still (basically) the same as the first film in one form or another. Thankfully it doesn't seem like a total cash-in (like so many sequels of this sort do) because it has a certain charm (as did the first film) and is still remarkably entertaining, all considered. But you can tell it was made solely because of the success of the first film - even Martin Short is back with another extended cameo as Franz the wedding manager. Of course you may be wondering why he's involved with a pregnancy, since his business is weddings. Here's a hint: more $$$ for the studio. Martin is basically doing the same thing he did in the first film - the weary upper-class guy who feels overwhelmed by the state of things. Diane Keaton is still very sweet and likable as his wife. The rest of the cast (including Macaulay's little brother Kieran Culkin) range from OK to good. Martin Short, however, is yet again a stand-out and is very funny - he wasn't necessary for the plot but he is funny and a good addition to the movie regardless. Overall I'd say this is one of those sequels that didn't need to be made, but could have been a lot worse. It's sweet, it's got some good lite-comedy moments, and in general it's just an enjoyable family movie that isn't trying to be anything other than simple entertainment -- which it is. Like Cliches?; ...That weren't even funny the first time? I've seen a lot of films with Steve Martin in them, and they all made me laugh.  Until this one. Part one is worth a look..it may make you laugh a couple of times (I think I laughed once).  But I recommend avoiding this one all together. Some of Martin's best work!; First, this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2. If run back to back, they run like one beautiful story. This production is great from start to finish. Everything about it is wonderful, including the story, the acting performances and the direction. This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor. His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances. He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man. This movie is no exception. His performance is comedic, yet startlingly genuine. Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's. I love this movie. I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character; with how he feels, and what he's going through. This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum, and I love it. It's less about family, and more about life's curves; the every-day things that make us crazy, happy, sad, and ultimately stronger. It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think, consider, ponder the events which have led us to where we are now. Combined, they rate 8.6/10 from... the Fiend :. I loved it, but one thing bothered me...; I enjoyed this movie: Diane Keaton is my favourite actress, Steve Martin always makes me laugh and Martin Short is great, but I felt really sorry for Keaton having to pretend to be pregnant. She didn't seem to be enjoying it and when the Banks were at the hospital, she actually looked rather bored, because whenever she spoke from the moment George protested about the doctor's name, she almost made it sound like she was in a maths lesson. Apart from that, it was great! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching Martin, Keaton or Short in a movie or who likes to laugh. 9/10 because of the little problem, but it was great. I loved it. Not bad...but could have been better; The first time I saw Father of the Bride 2 I really liked it.  I still enjoy watching some parts of it but I thought some realistic parts in the movie were not necessary.  First of all, the mother and daughter pregnant together.  This could happen but probably when the mother is not older than 40.  Nina had to be at least 47.  Is it likely that the mother would be pregnant at that age? I don't think so.  Secondly, I could not understand why George and Nina wanted the baby to have two last names.  Children always go by their father's last name and I thought Brian's father made a good observation when he said that George and Nina already had Matt to carry on the Banks name.  So why they thought the baby should have two last names is beyond me.  In conclusion, Father of the Bride 2 is still cute and fun to watch in some parts but I thought the first one was much better Not bad, but inferior to the first; I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the first movie. It was not without sentiment and it was hardly original, but it was still beautifully filmed, well acted, charming and funny. This sequel is not as good as the first I agree, but I still quite enjoyed it. The story is predictable, and there are some so-so parts in the script. Eugene Levy, who I do like by the way, is okay here but his character felt somewhat unnecessary and felt like he was there as an additional character and to give the film a longer length. And I also would have liked to have seen more of Kimberley Williams, she is so beautiful and quite a good actress, but I actually do agree that a little too much time is spent between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. However, it is beautifully filmed, has a nice soundtrack, decent pacing and good direction. And the acting is fine too, Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are still very likable, and while as I've said I would have liked to have seen more of her Kimberley Williams was lovely. And I loved Martin Short here too, he was one of the main merits of the first film, so to see him in his wonderfully fluffy turn again was a very nice surprise. Overall, not bad at all, could have been better, but I liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox Funny Sequel; Geogre Banks is getting used to life without his precious daughter Anne. Now he is thinking about all the free time he will have when his son is out of the house.That`s when Anne announces that she is going to have a baby.Geogre is shocked but he becomes even more shocked when he finds out his wife is going to have baby as well.Now he has to deal Franck helping out with the two pregnant women.Can Geogre ever get a break? This is my second favorite movie.My first is Father of the bride part I.This is a good movie.See it it is a great sequel.It is almost as good as the first one. Steve Martin steals the screen. Loved it!!; I thought the sequel to the first Father of the Bride just showed what a great chemistry Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, George Newbern, and Kieran Culkin, along with all the other supporting actors have together. I would actually love to see a Father of the Bride Part III and I usually hate more and more sequels. I really do enjoy this sequel and I think it is better than the first one. I would reccommend any and everyone seeing this movie (but not without seeing the first one). No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. This is my favorite movie; ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is my favorite movie.  I think it is funny, sweet, and truly touches the heart.  In the sequel to the previous, Father of the Bride, George Banks (Steve Martin) is finally getting over the fact that his beloved daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams)has gotten married.  But then she shocks him with the news that she is pregnant.  Everyone else is thrilled, but George is not.  He believes that he is too young to be a grandfather.  He tries to become young, but doesn't succeed.  Then, both he and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton) are shocked to find out that Nina is also pregnant.  George now thinks he is too old to be a father.  They have one other child other then Annie, Matty (Kieren Culkin.)  Through the chaotic turns of pregnancy, George learns to except the fact that his daughter has grown up and moved on, even though it is hard.  They also have to deal with Fronk (Martin Short,) the goofy wedding coordinator from the first movie, who is now designing the new baby's room.  They then discover that Annie has been given the opportunity to design a museaum in Boston, far away from their own, San Marino, California.  George now realizes that he will miss his daughter more then ever, but he learns to get along.  In the end, he enjoys being a grandfather to baby George, and a father again, to Megan, named after the doctor who delievered her.  In this funny and heartwarming sequel, everyone puts out fantastic performences once again.  Even though I very much enjoy Father of the Bride, I enjoy this much more. Very Warm and Funny.; This movie is a very warm and funny family film. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the Sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny. The only thing I didn't like was Eugene Levy's character, I found that his part was just put there to extend the movie a bit. I also didn't like how they used him in the second one when he was clearly the one who auditioned to be the wedding singer in the first one. All in all this is a great family film where many will enjoy and watch together. One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. Worthy second installment.; Mild SPOILERS are contained in the following comments. However, I believe everyone knows the story and how it turns out. The fun of the movie is seeing the actors, especially Martin. Steve Martin is back as George Banks, having just lost his daughter and basketball partner (Kimberly Williams as Annie ) to marriage, and now she is back home with her husband and a big announcement. She is pregnant. Of course everyone is happy, and the joy is doubled when Nina Banks (Diane Keaton as Annie's mom) finds out she is pregnant too. Poor George doesn't know if he can handle all this. After all, he is about to be a grandfather, he's not prepared to be a new father also. Martin Short is back as Franck Eggelhoffer, the unintelligible wedding planner. All ends well as both mom and daughter deliver their babies at the same time, in separate hospital rooms, so George has to go back and forth. The movie ends a few months later, and as Annie and her new baby are leaving, she gives dad a miniature basketball, a reminder to George that he can raise another basketball partner. Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. Better than the original; This one is definitely better than the original, funnier, smoother pace, and in some places, better acting! Plus Martin Short has more screen time. Great! This is a great movie for anyone who like good clean comedy. Awesome! Five out of Five Moose Stars! great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a 10, i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Deja Vu; I found this sequel to be both charming and entertaining. What I learned tonight is that this movie is actually a remake of the 1951 movie \"Father's Little Dividend\", which in turn was the sequel to the original \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and with the same great cast: Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Bennett, et al.  They both share the same broad comedy and story line (only one pregnancy in the earlier version though), and in their own ways are equally entertaining.  Old or new incarnations, however, be sure to see parts one and two in sequence. Average comedy sequel; There's been better, and there's been worse. \"Father of the Bride Part II\" falls right in between when it comes to sequels of comedies. The plot was easily predictable and the movie didn't have as many Steve Martin funny moments as the original. There were some good moments that made me laugh though, most being scenes with Martin Short. It did seem like sort of a stretch, though that all of the sudden \"Frank\" was an interior designer as well as a wedding/baby shower coordinator. I guess they just needed a way to keep him in the movie longer. I was hoping for a lot more when I rented this. My advice: stick to the original. Touching even in its weak state.; Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, and kimberly Williams Paisley return in Father of the Bride Part 2. The film as a sequel was slightly disappointing, but on the whole, likeable. George and Nina Banks are in for the surprise of their lives when they find themselves middleaged and expecting their third child.  The timing is impeccable as Annie Banks-MAckenzie also realizes that she is expecting. Thus Steve MArtin embarks on a nine month journey that will consist of him building a new room for the baby, watching his daughter become a woman and overdosing on sleeping pills.  Honestly, the film made me laugh hysterically and i shed a few tears at the bittersweet ending. 3 and 1/2 stars out of five. Pretty much just a rehash of the first; As this movie started, it reminded me a lot of the first. Various scenes were reenacted, only a little wackier, sort of like it was trying to be a shade more funny than the first; I guess that is the usual stuff for this type of sequels, but I think it failed at that. Apart from that, the movie pretty much succeeds in being a good sequel to the first. The story is also somewhat reminiscent of the first one. All the same actors return as well, and they are pretty much the same, just a shade more wacky. The story is also told by Steve Martins character, George Banks, like in the first. Pretty much everything in the movie is a takeoff of the first; this doesn't make it bad though, if you liked the first, liked the characters, you'll want to see this too, if nothing else, to see the characters again. It is about as funny and as sentimental as the first was, and as enjoyable. Fans of the first one, or of Steve Martin will most likely enjoy at least some part of it, as this is the typical for both the first movie and Steve Martin. 7/10 Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie. A (Rare) Good Sequel; The first \"Father of the Bride\" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin's great comedic \"Dad\" character with the emotions of marrying off his \"only\" (to that point!) daughter. However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor. Thankfully, \"Father of the Bride II\" does not fall into this trap. With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather. Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton). Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women! Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments. Whereas the first film captured George's equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George's identity crisis. With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family. Overall, this film is just as good as the original. The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare. Let's just say that if a \"Grandfather of the Bride\" were in the works, I would be first in line. My comments are going to be very positive.; Hi! I think that Father of the Bride Part 2 was a great film and very hilarious. I think that the mother and daughter could have been pregnant at the same time!  It was a great movie and I recommend it to all people who want a warm-your-heart comedy! It's a great film! Thanks! I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. I really found this film quite annoying; My basic opinion of this movie is that it is a crappy American feel good comedy. It is simply about a man who is going through another mid-life crisis as his daughter, who was married in the first movie, has a baby in this one. The catch is that his wife is also pregnant and with the irony really dripping, both of them have their babies within minutes of each other. As such the kid's auntie is exactly the same age as him (it won't happen to me, though it is possible). When I watch this movie I think to myself, this guy really doesn't have problems. There are people out there that have much more serious problems than he does. He admits to having a beautiful wife who loves him, owns his own home (or did), has a great job and great kids - and he thinks he has problems. Maybe the whole comedy is in the fact that he is worrying about absolutely nothing, but seriously, when I watch this movie, I simply shake my head and think that the guy is a loser. I really don't think it is all that funny. In fact, the guy has much more serious problems. He seems to be spending an awful lot of money, and is going to find himself in a huge amount of debt, and he doesn't seem to ever be at work. My question is not only where he gets his money, but where he gets the collateral for all of the purchases he is making. He buys back his house for an extra $100,000 on top of what he sold it for, and really, how can he seriously afford it. Okay, it wasn't all that bad. As a movie is was made well, and I did chuckle a few times. But in reality, this guy is a serious loser because he has more than anybody could possibly ask for, and he is worried about growing old. Hell, we all grow old, but he has experience more than what a lot of us have already had. Instead of worrying about growing old, the twit should look back on his life and be thankful for the blessings that God has already given him as opposed to forgetting all of that and winging about his age. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late '40's)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... The Best Movie of All Time; let me tell you.. anyone who does not like the movie is just a little close minded.. i read comments that thought the movie was too unrealistic but thats what makes it so great! i mean look at other movies such as lord of the rings or star wars neither or them contain true reality.. this is why its a movie. Anyway, i loved Steve martin in this movie. he does a magnificent job of playing the character for an over protective dramatic father. he was the best actor. who could have played the part of Nina as well as Diane Keaton. she makes the part of the mom annoyingly overwhelming mother, which is exactly what the point of us as the audience to think of her. martin short is the best of all \"fra'nk's\". the way he seeks George banks's approval is perfect. and lastly Kimberly Williams is the gorgeous daughter we are all expecting her to be.. i watch this movie every night before bed and i can recite every word to this movie. because of father of the bride II i have dreamed to meet Steve martin.. \"hes my hero!!\" hopefully you fall in love with it too. and dream to be pregnant with your mother as did Annie banks. Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. 5/10 And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW2, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. daughter gets married; In the sequel to Father of the Bride we have the daughter getting married and moving away from home, this presents a big dilemma to the father played of course by Steve Martin. Maybe not quite as funny as the first one,, or as good,, but definitely above average,, it's always a pleasure watching Steve Martin work at his craft. The movie is basically about how the family,, especially the parents deal with their young daughter growing up,, getting married, and eventually moving away from the nest.. the cameo from Eugene Levy is just wonderful,, as a real estate agent who is trying to sell the very home where our main character lives.. all in all a very family friendly movie,, that I would recommend. Not as good as the first, but still great fun.; In the sequel to the brilliant Father Of The Bride, Nina Banks and her daughter Annie are both pregnant and George Banks, being his usual nervous self has to learn to get used to the idea that he's going to be a father again AND a grandfather. The whole cast including, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams and Martin Short are all back here giving good performances. Even though Father Of The Bride Part II is not as good as the first Father Of The Bride, this is still a great movie which is enjoyable and fun all the way through and that's why I'm going to give this good sequel a 10/10.  Heartwarming & Hilarious; Steve Martin does it again in this touching and funny sequel to 1991's Father Of The Bride the rest of the cast returns in a new story dealing with the joys of parenthood. I loved Father Of The Bride II not only because it was funny, mostly it was due to the comic antics of a man dealing with two pregnancies at once. He's a great comedian as well as an on screen father, my favorite scene is when both babies arrive at the same time. A year has passed since George Banks (Martin) watched his only daughter Annie (Williams) get married and has accepted her transformation from daughter to wife. She comes home with her husband Brian (Newbern) to announce the wonderful news to her parents, brother Matty (Culkin) and in-laws that she's pregnant. Everyone is thrilled and excited except for George who thinks he's too young to be a grandpa, from then on he tries to act young by dying his hair and exercising. But things are about to get a little crazy when his loving wife Nina (Keaton)discovers she's pregnant too now George must deal with the impending arrival of both his grandchild and his own child. Thrown into the chaos is Franck Eggelhoffer (Short) the wedding coordinator who helps to design a room for the new addition to the Banks family. This movie is not only sweet but it's charming entertainment for fans of all ages. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the 1951 sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of 50. This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! Father of the Bride Part II; The first film was the remake of the original version starring Spencer Tracy and Dame Elizabeth Taylor, and it became very popular, so naturally they felt like a sequel was needed to continue the story. Basically George Banks (Golden Globe nominated Steve Martin) is getting used to the fact that his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) has become the bride now wife and got married to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), and more surprisingly a mother when she reveals she is pregnant. With this revelation comes out George has a small midlife crisis, and he tries to recapture his youth, including dying his hair, but he does eventually settle somewhat and get used to the idea that he will be a grandfather. But then he is shocked to find out he will be a father again as well when his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) reveals that she is also pregnant, and it may appear that both her and Annie's baby will be born on the same day. With these things happening, and the house having leaks and termites there is the opportunity to change things by selling the house to Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy), but he changes his mind later. When George manages to get the house back, despite a higher price, he gets the help of camp wedding planner/coordinator, now interior designer, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) to make the baby rooms and get things ready for the arrival of children. There are a couple of false alarms from Annie where she thinks the baby is coming, but eventually it comes to the real thing, and they rush to hospital, and of course Nina goes in to labour as well. In the end George is very happy to be holding both his new baby son and his new baby granddaughter is his arms, before his daughter and her husband move away to their own new home. Also starring Kieran Culkin as Matty Banks, B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein, Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie and Jane Adams as Dr. Megan Eisenberg. I can see what the critics mean by giving it two out of five stars in certain places, it certainly isn't as funny as the original film, it concentrates more on the sentimental material, but that's not a bad thing for this comedy drama. Okay! A really likable comedy.; I enjoyed this film. I found that it was easy to relate to Steve Martin's character George Banks as a parent. The relationship between him and his daughter Annie, played by Kimberly Williams, was an honest father daughter relationship. I recommend this one for parents in general and empty nesters in particular. The idea of a mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time is plausible and amusing. like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $15k bonus to move out in 10 days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $100k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. Father of the Bride II; Likable, but not as impressive a follow up to the 1991 hit with Martin now dealing with his daughter being pregnant...And, oh yeah...his wife is pregnant again too. good, but a mistake; this movie rocks. but there is one thing weird. okay, so in the beginning Annie says, \"i have lived here since i was 5!\" and then later right when they are selling the house and playing basketball Annie and George(her dad) and her dad says \"i remember the first time we played out here, you were 4.\" wait...so was she 4 or 5 when they moved in??????????? other than that this movie makes me laugh, cry(because i laugh so much), and..........uh.....what was that other thing people say when they say that? i don't really remember. i just love how Steve martin always is so cheap. I am forced to say more so i will say i love that this movie is always on HBO! And i realized something, Steve martin has had white hair like forever! Not as good as the first, but good family fun; This movie is as thin as you can get. Its' emotions are easily played. There are no surprises. It is very predictable. And I say...so what? What is wrong with that? This is an American Dream movie. Everything goes perfectly and everyone is as happy as can be. Why should it be a complicated character study? It deals with the birth of babies. There's no complex feelings that need to be dealt with in this situation. A life is being created. A family is being blessed. A baby's birth is a time for love and hope. This movie has both in spades. It's a very positive movie that shows the joy a new baby brings. Every parent-to-be should watch it. A child's birth is an emotional event with no equal. This movie knows it and milks it for all its' worth. My only complaint is it should have been called Parents of the Bride. Way too much time is spent with the relationship between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. There should have been more attention paid to Kimberly Williams. Not only were the scenes between her and Martin the best scenes in this and the original, but Kimberly Williams is the most beautiful actress to come out of Hollywood in many years. Forget all the blond, silicone filled, bimbos that every teenage boy raves about. Ms. Williams is a natural beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****. Better than the first one!; I love Steve Martin, but I was disappointed by the first movie, so I wasn't expecting as much from this one.  But to my surprise, this one was even better! It's constantly funny, just like one should expect from Steve Martin; it's not preoccupied with corny emotion, like the first movie was. It's Steve Martin in his best performance since \"My Blue Heaven.\" Sometimes sequels can be surprisingly good.  This one is better.  It has all the comedic elements that were stagnant in the first movie.  It's everything the first movie should have been, and more! As I understand it, there were accusations of anti-Arab stereotyping?; \"Father of the Bride II\" may seem to some people like a lesser Steve Martin movie, with him as the patriarch from the previous movie now having to deal with his daughter's and wife's pregnancies. Unpretentiously silly. But one interesting thing is that apparently, some Arab groups claimed that the movie was making anti-Arab stereotypes, as a Middle Eastern man buys their house with plans to demolish it. I wouldn't have interpreted that as anti-Arab; I mean, it's not like they're portraying him as a terrorist. Oh well, life goes on. The movie's a nice, goofy way to pass time. I really liked the scene where they bring Steve Martin into the hospital (that would've sure been an embarrassment!). Also starring Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, B.D. Wong and Eugene Levy. Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video Good, but first one was better; This film is good but you have to suspend disbelief quite a few times. All the performances are fine, with Steve Martin a scream again, and Diane Keaton glowing from start to finish (she has a lot more to do here than in FOTB1). The best scenes are: George trying to get buff in the gym, asking which famous men he's younger than, pointing to his wedding ring at the lady in the car next to him, and seeing all the misbehaving children out the window in his car while his wife sees all the happy kids and their parents out her window. And of course, when George holds his child and grandchild outside the delivery room. My favorite line: \"Now going to the movies will be economical: one child, two seniors, thanks!\" Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Good; This is well worth seeing. Everything goes perfectly. Ain't no such thing as too much Steve Martin, baby. Here Martin carries weak material, but it's a positive movie that shows the joy a new child brings. You will laugh, cry and cheer. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Some of the dialog is a bit lost on US audiences, but still some hilarious lines. The music is amazing throughout. Also the scenery is incredible. I saw the cast had a lot of great comedians, so I thought there would at least be a few laughs. Instead, I was surprised to see a very touching movie, absolutely great script. I give it 7 out of 10. AWESOME!; This movie is great!  I think it's one of the best movies ever made!  I love both Father of the Bride I and II!  I think that it is cute how they have the mother and daughter pregnant at the same time!  I hope that they come out with a Father of the Bride Part III, that would be awesome! :-) Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. 2.5 out of 5 stars. Good, so long as you don't try to think too much; It was a fun movie, but it had no particular substance. I mostly watched it because I'd seen the first one. And because it was free on my cable. Or at least, I wasn't paying only to see it. Now, I have done that before and been pleasantly surprised, but this just wasn't one of those movies. Most of what was in this movie has been done already in the first film, and then it was in a much better way. Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, I'm just glad that I got to watch it free. Sure, Steve Martin's always fun to watch, particularly when he's acting dopey for whatever reason, but that didn't make it a great film. Just mediocre. Still, it's fun for a laugh. A Well-Done Sequel!; A sequel to immensely likable Father of the Bride, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is A Well-Done Sequel! Its enjoyable as well as emotional! 'Father of the Bride Part II' Synopsis: George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. 'Father of the Bride Part II' is worthy sequel of a wonderful prequel. The characters still appeal, the humor works & the emotional moments are heartfelt as well. Nancy Meyers & Charles Shyer's Screenplay is genuinely well-done. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography & Editing are fair. Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains. On the whole, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is a satisfying sequel. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the 1951 movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the 1950 classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the 4 year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. A so so sequel; 'Father of the bride' was a good film and probably didn't need a sequel. But this is Hollywood, everything needs a sequel. While it is clear that a lot of effort has gone into making this sequel work, the central idea stretches credibility and every idea the writer had seems to have been thrown at the wall in a desperate attempt to get laughs. There are moments that remind you of the heart and humour that the preceding film had, but it's a load of nothing really. I went into this film dubious about how good it could be, and I didn't finish watching it any more convinced that the original needed a sequel. \"Father 2\" : Born again.; Okay,now the sequel \"Father Of The Bride 2\",which was surprisingly better than expected. Like anyone who sees a sequel,you expect almost a carbon copy of the first. It does start similar to the first movie,with George sitting in a chair addressing us,the audience. It also does an unfortunate repeat of the fight between Annie & Bryan,again like the first movie,I saw it coming. The baby shower party is not played big,like the first after wedding party but I laughed when actual storks carrying little bundles showed up. I was kind of \"iffy\" on the sub-plot of George selling the house,having to leave in ten days and then blowing a bundle to get it back again. I'm not questioning the probability (we know in reality that'd be impossible),I just found it kind of unnecessary. I did however like his dyed hair and new look,that was hilarious and he should have kept it until the end of the movie. Some may say the idea of a mother & daughter being pregnant at the same time,is impossible. Yet,somehow it works here. It's not just the obvious next step for Annie but for George and his wife too,who thought having babies was way behind them. I love Steve Martin's warped expression when Bryan calls him a \"Grandfather\"! I liked that a woman having a baby in her 40's was taken very seriously,since it's a fact that women who have babies later in life have a more difficult time. It makes for a good piece of drama in a film that's otherwise a family comedy. The comedy is helped once again by the presence of Martin Short and I like that he becomes more involved with the family. Especially helping George out the front door on his back. This after giving him sleeping pills for rest. Once the babies are born and Bryan & Annie head to Boston for a new life,the film gets a very touching ending with George and his new baby girl. 8 out of 10 for the expected repeat of ideas,otherwise a very well made sequel. (END) Fantastic; Both the first movie and this sequel are fantastic. I loved the first movie, so I thought I would give the second one a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised!! The acting from all the characters is amazing, from Steve Martin to Diane Keaton to Kimberly Williams-Paisley. 16 years after its release this movie is still a gem. When I'm feeling down or just need a go-to comedy for a night in, these two movies are the best. For those who say that a 40-something woman is too old to have a baby--that's just not true. Do your research. I bet more people have been in that situation than you think. Anyway, this is a feel-good movie for some great laughs and a few happy tears! Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in 1995. It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. not bad for a sequel; as sequels go,this is film isn't too bad.i didn't think ti was quite as good as the first one,but it's not a bad effort.i didn't find it as funny,and some of Steve Martin's histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me.really,this one doesn't quite have the same sincerity as the first.through much of this movie,i was all too aware i was watching a movie,whereas with firs tone,i was drawn in,and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting.having said that,there are some bright spots.for,one,this movie is just as touching as the first.and Eugene levy has a great cameo.and there is still some fun to be had.even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above,i still think Father of the Bride II is a 7/10 Not exactly the most innovative of films, but still great fun!; This is an excellent, funny, warming film. Although a lot of the \"same kind of thing\" was done in the first movie, it's still entertaining. Steve Martin's character was good, although at times his behaviour is quite pathetic and Martin Short is again entertaining. (Particularly his pronunciation of the word 'pregnant).' Although it's highly predictable and not the most intellectually stimulating of films it is still well worth watching and the vast majority of people would enjoy this film. What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Father of the Bride Part II; The 1991 Steve Martin comedy proved out to be popular enough to earn a sequel, much like the original Father of the Bride of 1950. All of the main cast of the first film returns in a story where the eponymous father George Banks (Martin) has gotten over the stressful wedding of his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) and her fiancé Bryan (George Newbern). However, when she breaks the big news about her pregnancy to the family, the grandpa-to-be becomes anxious about getting older and starts proving his youthfulness in various ways, such as selling the family's beloved house to a greedy real estate developer Habib (Eugene Levy). Life has more in store for George and his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) though, as it soon turns out that Annie's is not the only pregnancy in the family. Again, the humour is best when it relies on Steve Martin's comical talent and charisma instead of craziness and exaggeration. Unfortunately, adhering to the rule of always making sequels bigger and louder, the writers have given more screen time to the unbelievably annoying wedding planner Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) whose noisy and flamboyant scenes are certainly the weakest parts of the whole movie. The fussy bumbling caused by the impending childbirths at the end is also rather annoying and unimaginative. I think the movie works best during the more subtle scenes, such as Martin making uncomfortable faces while hiding his nervousness or arguing about the baby's surname with the overjoyed family during a dinner. Besides the run-of-the-mill jokes, the movie also shamelessly wallows in impenetrable sentimentalism of the newborns' adorability. Especially the music is so unbelievably schmaltzy that it was really getting on my nerves while watching; can't the filmmakers just trust their material's appeal without burying it under a sweety-tweety sugar mountain? Nevertheless, despite the predictability of the plot and the not-so-hilarious jokes, George Banks is a very likable character and Steve Martin is at home in the role, so those who enjoyed the first movie will probably like this one too  the basic building blocks of the story have not been changed at all.

       "      <td>Full Refund Please; In a SNL skit, an audience member tells Charlie Sheen that he took a date to see \"Men at Work\" and bought popcorn and soda and such. Charlie Sheen then hands him $30 and apologizes. That's what my wife and I thought after we saw this movie. The concept of common sense evaded people who are characterized by having it in abundance. I seriously doubt FBI agents make the same stupid mistakes or have the same idiotic hang-ups that the agents had in this movie. There could have been more on the technical side of profiling and less on the lameness of the plot. It got to the point where the agents were doing things that even my wife admitted she wouldn't be stupid enough to do. If I ever meet Val Kilmer or Christian Slater, I'm going to tell them I saw this movie. Hopefully they will understand that it's 100 minutes of my life I'll never get back, and will at least give me $40 to make up for the money I spent. Fluff-Stuff; Formulaic thrill ride with intellectual pretensions as F.B.I. profilers are at the center. The best and the brightest. Ooops! That is the problem in this visually vigorous \"guess the killer among us\" Movie. The Agents don't seem to be too smart although they pretend to be, spin and solve a Rubik's Cube in less than two minutes, is an obvious and ostentatious display. If you buy these characters and settle in for the somewhat creative and sanguinary serial killings, the Movie might pass as an entertaining diversion. The set-ups and the executions are the main thing here and complexity or the mysterious are shelved. An acceptable entry into the middle rungs of this kind of thing that has more style than substance. The ending is ho-hum and goes on a bit too long, but in the end it is watchable but frivolous fluff-stuff. Not A lot of thought went into Mindhunters; When Christian Slater is on the marquee of the movie you're about to see, you can pretty much expect a couple things. The first one is that Slater most likely will die within the first reel and the other one is that the movie will probably suck. \"Mindhunters\" doesn't disappoint on either level. This is not a spoiler, this is fact. Val Kilmer, another fallen star, is a sadistic trainer for a group of would be FBI profilers. The group is on the verge of advancing in the program but as a final test, Kilmer brings them to a secluded island to test their skills. The problem is that a killer is offing each profiler one by one and the agents all suspect each other. They all become paranoid and there is a lot of gun pointing. This movie has some entertaining moments and I give it some props for coming up with such interesting ways of impalement and death. But for the most part, this movie is pretty stupid. The motivation behind all the violence is really pretty weak and I knew exactly when the little twist comes in to play. \"Mindhunters\" is decent popcorn fare, but it's really a waste of time. (**) A very insightful film--even better from an intellectual viewpoint; The lady doth protest too much... I personally thought this was a good film, with a lot of interesting sub-texts. No film is perfect, so I was hardly expecting it to be a \"Usual Suspects\" calibre-film, or \"American Beauty\" (to name but two of my favourite all-time ones), but it was excellent for giving food for thought. The idea about people exposing their weaknesses and their strengths and how that can be used against them was scary. I took one cue from this movie--and that was, perhaps naively, it's not always too good to show too much of what type of person you are. Not that there are serial killers lurking round every corner, but I think the film is a metaphor for how our weaknesses, strengths, and whatnot of our characters can make or mar us. Clichéd perhaps, but a useful reminder not to reveal yourself too much as there are dark and dangerous minds out there. What I disliked, though, was some of the dialogue being too predictable--serial killers are supposed to have been bed-wetters; thankfully, there was none of that in there, but the reference to parents gave the game away. On a positive note, I liked LL Cool J's acting. I though it was solid and robust. He delivered his lines with tremendous ease, and made his \"gate-crashing\" very well-intervened. To add to the above, I think there's an existential element about this yarn that I don't have sufficient knowledge to elaborate on---but I would recommend for those that disliked the film for the story-line, try watching it again, paying close attention to how the killer was able to kill everyone off. Note the ideas about \"misdirection\" and people's habits...and it can potentially send a shiver down the spine at worst, and at best, give fantastic food for thought for next time when you're at a party with people you don't know, how you don't tell them \"I don't go anywhere without my gun\":-) I give it an 8/10 excellent; this is a really good movie i would recommend it to anyone who likes a thriller and a mystery. its keeps you on your feet. watch it if you have the chance. if like mysteries than you will like this one. the reason why i rated it 9 out of 10 because it was nail bitting and it had many new plots you never knew who was the killer. anyways watch it. if you haven't then go to the movie store and buy it, don't rent it cause you will waste the 5 bucks. its that good that you don't want to rent it you want to buy it. i don't have anything else to say because i'm not supposed to give it away. its a good movie just go and see it gosh go and see it Awful; Warning - Spoilers ahead I was really mad that Val Kilmer had to die in this movie.  This movie would have been good if Val Kilmer would have survived.  I do however liked LL Cool J's role.  This movie was really freaky.  It shows you that a killer gets those that have a liking for certain things. \"CSI\" meets Agatha Christie meets \"Copycat\"... and not in a good way; &gt;&gt;SPOILERS AHEAD&lt;&lt; The story borrows something from every feature listed above, but the plot is mostly Agatha Cristie's \"10 Little Indians\". The killer is among the isolated group of victims and, as in every Christie's story, you spend the whole time guessing the proverbial \"who did it\". Of course everybody has some kind of motive and is, therefore, a possible suspect, until his own death clears him of the suspicion. Unfortunately this formula has already been heavily exploited in the past (even by Christie herself), so it gets pretty tiresome once the stage is set up. You watch characters getting killed off one after another in a series of contrived (and pretty unbelievable) ambushes they keep falling into (and to think they are meant to be intelligent above average - crime investigators). You wonder who the killer is but numerous twists and turns keep you (and the characters) from pinpointing someone particular. In the aftermath it's no wonder that the killer is NEVER who you thought would be. No, the killer is the one who gets killed off earlier but is never checked for pulse (literally). And it is always kind of a let down. Of course the final battle between the killer and the last victim never goes without the villain explaining why he did what he did (for the audience). As if it mattered. So once you take the plot for what it really is - a vehicle for an action thriller - you get a solid action movie, but without much thrills. Blood and gore is there, but one has seen worse. Fight scenes are well executed but there is always something funny about them, in a slapstick sort of way. And the final showdown with gunfire under water is hilarious! Harlin is a decent action director, but is evidently lacking in building suspense and making us care for the characters. The minute he kills off the only character you could potentially like (Slater), we are left with a group of hysterical and slow-witted people you just can't wait to see disposed (that goes particularly for that Indian girl who is plainly overacting). If you want real psycho-drama-thriller watch \"Copycat\". If you care for modern-style blood and gore watch CSI on TV. And if you want to see Harlin's only real masterpiece watch \"A Long Kiss Goodnight\". An all around good thriller; This is probably the best FBi thriller made ever. The acting is great and it keeps you guessing the whole film (I am mad at the discussion board users because they gave away who the killer is and i haven't watched it all yet) but its still fantastic. It has the best murder sequences since Freddy Krueger hit Elm street, i loved how well the characters were developed and how well they were murdered. I saw about 55 minutes of it and three people were killed off (If you a guy who watches these movies for the murders) and each time the killer is not shown, he just sets traps for them. The film was great and the acting terrific, where are the Oscars on this one? It stinks (possible spoilers); I personally think Renny Harlen is one of the most underrated directors working in Hollywood--he has more talent in his little finger than an an Antoine Fuqua or Gore Verbinski, both of whom have managed to direct action movies without having the slightest idea how to actually stage exciting action scenes.  I mean as bad as Cutthroat Island was, it had far more impressive action sequences than anything in Pirates of the Carribbean.  Unfortunately it didn't have much of anything else and that's the problem with Harlen--he's a truly gifted filmmaker who has no talent whatsoever when it comes to choosing his scripts. This one ranks alongside Driven as being Harlen's worst to date.  The premise is promising, although it bares more than a passing resemblance to the derided (but better) Stallone vehicle Detox. People who go to movies looking for Friday the 13th style colorful kills will probably enjoy this.  The problem for me was that the murders were so outlandish they not only seemed completely impossible--they actually crossed the line into goofy self-parody.  This movie generates little suspense, the script (by the writer/director of The Cooler) doesn't make much sense, the biggest stars are killed off or disappear from the movie early.  Pretty much everything that can be wrong with this movie is. The studio should just dump this garbage on cable where it belongs--a theatrical release would be a waste of time and money, although the film could pick up a cult following among drunken frat boys who will no doubt enjoy the goofy murders. Correction On Previous Comment:; I have made an egregious error.  Renny Harlin did not direct STRIKING DISTANCE, although he is responsible for DEEP BLUE SEA and that Andrew \"Dice\" Clay vehicle THE ADVENTURES OF FORD FAIRLANE.  The man truly responsible is Rowdy Herrington.  Herrington has helmed such classics as GLADIATOR (the one with Brian Dennehy, 1992) and the mullet showcase that was ROAD HOUSE.  I offer my heartfelt apologies to anyone who this mistake has offended or confused, and to the family, friends and representation of Mr. Harlin.  They are both bad directors but by far Herrington is the lesser film maker.  Thank You.... Mindless; Jake Harris (Val Kilmer) runs a training program for FBI profilers. It's above and beyond the normal gun training. He takes the team to Oniega Island off the coast of North Carolina to take part in a simulation. Philadelphia P.D. detective Gabe Jensen (LL Cool J) tag along to observe. They are assigned a serial killer called the Puppeteer. However the killings soon become real. It's an Agatha Christie murder mystery crossed with the modern trend of serial killer and FBI profilers. The problem is that it's so completely fake. I'm not saying murder mysteries are always about realism. There is something over the top ridiculous about this that drains the brains out of this thriller. I'm not invested in guessing who is the real killer. It becomes how crazy each perfectly timed kill gets. That has a bit of value but not that much. The director that critics love to hate; Let's face it, along with Tony Scott, Renny Harlin is probably the critics least favorite major filmmaker, and I must admit the guy has made a couple of real clunkers (Cutthroat Island was deservedly trashed), but this is the second of his critically lambasted films that I truly enjoyed. \"Deep Blue Sea\" is the other. Yeah, the plot holes in \"Mindhunters\" were colossal, but man I was thoroughly entertained for 100 or so minutes. To even start to describe the plot it sounds ridiculous, but I am surprised this movie did not do better at the box office. In a word this film was fun, gross, but fun. OK that's two words. And there is something that happened in this film that may be the new Harlin signature. Here comes a minor spoiler...... So stop reading if you plan to rent the DVD..... Just like in \"Deep Blue Sea\" the films major star is killed off first. Also in a similar way.... That is with a very gross demise. Wonder if this is a future trend in his movies. By the way the major director that I love to hate is Stephen Sommers. How does that guy ever get a job? Watch it as a comedy and not a thriller, much better; This movie is about a bunch of FBI wannabe profilers who get dumped on an island and left to solve a simulated case when they start getting bumped off for real. From the very first killing to the last these FBI wannabes are utterly clueless and incompetent. It's like watching Police Academy: The horror years or something. Some of the methods for killing off the agents are more inventive than in saw and, of course, just as likely to totally fail because they are over engineered. In fact, treating it as a comedy made for a better movie than treating it as a serious thriller. Not even worth watching for the famous actors...; *SPOILERS* ...because they die in the first eighth of the movie. What makes this so bad is not that they are the most respected actors in the film, it's the fact that they seemed to be the main focus at the start of the movie. The film never seemed to get the slightest character development from any of the other characters, and the editing was horrible. The movie didn't run smoothly. It felt like a TV movie, because it kept jumping from one scene to the other. First of all, they're accusing this guy, then they're accusing this guy, and this guy...your head may go dizzy keeping up with the film. The death scenes are also outrageously hilarious. I felt like I was watching a serious version of Airplane! The film is also very fast paced, and by fast paced, I mean faster than the damn Flash. There is a lot of death scenes in the movie that try to be emotional, but they aren't because we get zero character development to make us pity them. In fact, you kind of wanted the characters that didn't die to die. There was also a pointless scene at the start of the movie that was obviously trying to hook us...then it turned out to just be a police training sequence. So, they decide to go training on a desert island. Don't worry, the film gets worse as it goes along. In fact, the only good thing I can remember about this movie is the quotes in the film, which were quite funny, especially the \"eeny meany miny moe who's the next mother to go\" quote. But apart from that, this film was utter crap, and I can't believe some people find this underrated. I was expecting a lower score than 6.4/10 for this pile of stink. Don't worry, there's also a lot of cliché helicopter flying scenes, which were popular in the early 2000's. Overall, I guess you can watch it to have a laugh, but if you're looking for a serious, gripping mystery with GOOD plot twists, stay away from this. 1.9/10! The movie was great,and the plot was pretty good...; I've been reading comments where people say some situations are over the top and that they act silly and do stuff that are hard to believe.Well,seeing as they are professional profilers and must have great minds,what did you expect?'course the hole plot was a bit dramatic but hey,the dude is crazy and brilliant,what did you expect?It's a fantastic movie and I fail to see why people are so into putting down great movies...I bet some saw it twice just to find something wrong...then again,I agree some actors could be different but the hole team fits perfectly,so why the hell complain?In my opinion the best part was when they all fall asleep because of the coffee and when Sara changes the time to stay 15 minutes behind.Really clever.And Nic's death was the most well thought in my opinion....great job,indeed. Good, fun movie; I think this was a terrific script which could have been an amazing film - but for  some major cheese spread throughout.  BUT it still is a very exciting film with  generally decent acting. It is full of good twists and generally keeps attention.  Far, far better than I expected with some amazing moments. Derivative and has a few plot holes but exciting enough to make up for it; This was a movie I enjoyed a lot. If you're looking for originality this isn't the movie for you but it takes a tried and true movie formula and pulls it off well.There is a very clever satire of Silence of the Lambs at the beginning which is funny but the main plot is a bunch of would-be profilers go on a field-training exercise on a remote island. Well you know the rest. Suddenly things become very real when they start dying one by one. Since there is no one else on the island which is used for \"war games\" and FBI training, the killer has to be one of THEM. Can they \"profile\" the killer and catch him or her before they're all dead? Well of course paranoia sets in and the devilishly clever killer is able to exploit each victim's individual weaknesses. There are lots of plot twists of course but I found the identity of the killer rather easy to guess if you were paying attention and \"profiling\" throughout the movie. Certainly you'd think real profilers-in-training would have been able to figure it out. But the plot is still very exciting with all it's twists and turns and LL Cool J does an especially good job playing a cop who is \"observing\" the exercise and not an FBI agent and thus becomes the natural \"outsider\" in the group. In the end, if you just take the movie for what it is, a basic and rather unoriginal thriller, which is never the less exciting and in some ways well-crafted, you won't be disappointed. It delivers all or most of what this type of movie should and is a lot better than many I've seen. 8/10 Serial killing For Dummies . . . By Dummies; What is it about this concept that has now created two of the worst thrillers in recent history? (The first being the Sly Stallone atrocity \"Eye See You\", ironically seen by very few). In all honesty, I think the idea -- A group of law enforcement types trapped in a confined area, then stalked and slaughtered by a serial killer -- has potential for a really cool flick . . . This sure as hell ain't it. The so-called Feds here never seem to have come across a dead body in their lives (The female lead is not only nauseated by real corpses but bloodied dummies as well), let alone trained as profilers. The writers, meanwhile, seem to have never met a cliché they didn't like. Toss into this 'sh** stew' director Renny Harlin (who once upon a time actually had talent) inventing up increasingly ridiculous camera angles (Stay tuned for the clock's POV!)every two minutes or so, a kinetic fight sequence out of a (bad) Jet Li flick and some of the silliest (not to mention contrived) murders on celluloid and you have . . . this. The most scariest thing about this movie is that the finale -- Featuring a laughable underwater face-off --was apparently the best of five allegedly filmed endings. Now that truly boggles the mind. Good Suspense; Saw this on cable and I must say it is pretty darn good. The traps set by the antagonist was gruesome and elaborate. The suspense was built up at a good pace, however, the finale and the uncovering of the killer should have been tweaked a bit. I enjoyed Patricia Valasquez as she is one of the fine-looking Hispanic actresses out there and she kept her accent which is a plus when Hollywood insists foreign actors speak with an American accent. I am glad no sequel was made to the best of my knowledge. It would have been pretty watered down and would not live up to the original. The idea of using FBI profilers is a good idea and the settings on a deserted island is also well done. I recommend this good thriller. Terrible; Okay, lets get right down to business. The plot is about some FBI trainees who are close to graduation under the eccentric tutelage of Val Kilmer. For their final test they are transported to a training island where they will find a murder scene and have to come up with a profile for the killer. Now maybe I'm not as aware as I think I am but the FBI does not train like this...they do not take a random group of people to a classified training island to come up with a profile, but that's besides the point. But let's keep going. In this group you've got just about everybody represented...white, hispanic, black, handicapped... Over a weekend, they are supposed to find the crime scene and come up with the killer's profile. But when they find the crime scene, gasp, one of the group is killed in an impossibly intricate set-up. These will only get worse as the film goes on, however. As the group comes under stress, each character reacts in a different way as expected and of course you're subject to the usual \"who did it\" dramas which end up taking up half of the remaining movie as of course, one by one, characters get killed off in an impossibly intricate ways as the group set about trying to get the killer's profile. So eventually, everybody dies except for the people you expect to make it to the last scene and then of course they fight and get into a shootout over the mock-up town. Then there is a predictable \"twist\" which is followed by a silly underwater gun fight... Movies like these try to be so clever and more often than not, they fail. Some of the acting is pretty bad and it has all the tired old plot lines for some of the characters and in reality, the real killer would never have had enough time to do everything he does in the film. For instance, when he is confessing himself to one of the last remaining characters, he says he used the time when the team was drugged by the coffee to set everything up. Well, okay...one of the things he did was use blood to write numbers on some windows...except there were hundreds if not thousands of numbers in a precise order...this alone would have taken hours. Furthermore, most of his traps would have required precise timing and exact measurements to pull off and with equipment that he could not have known would be available to him upon arriving on this island. If you're looking for something to pass the time and you see this movie on some movie channel, give it a shot but don't expect much. But this sad rip-off of \"Ten Little Indians\" just doesn't pull it off...way too many plot holes. The most disappointing movie I have ever seen in my life; I remember sitting in \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" for the first time, waiting for the movie to start, watching the previews. There was this cool-looking trailer for a mystery/thriller in the vein of And Then There Were None . . . Mindhunters! I looked it up, and it looked pretty freakin' sweet. And then it was pushed back. A LOT. The anticipation built. And then, when it finally came out, I was the first in line to go see it. And what a disappointment. 18 months of looking forward to a movie and I get THIS? The characters are lame, flat, and boring. They don't propel the story, and they all seem like they're made out of cardboard. Not a single one of them is sympathetic. The main character was kinda developed during one or two scenes, but there were far too many scenes of nothing but explaining what's going on, and the typical: \"What are we going to do?\" \"I don't know.\" \"We need to find the killer.\" Blah blah blah. Keanu Reeves and Plank from Ed, Edd, and Eddy could've made these characters more interesting. Even worse, the deaths weren't thrilling in the least. There's one scene in which a character has his legs frozen by liquid nitrogen. He falls over, they shatter, and he's dead. Woo hoo! Only the scene wasn't thrilling due to horrible special effects and even worse acting from all of the leads. The only thing we got out of that character was a steamy scene earlier in the film . . . I didn't feel bad for him. And the ending is just horrible. It's not that it's predictable, it's that it makes no sense whatsoever. Apparently the killer can teleport and rig up crazy booby traps in the blink of an eye, because they (I say \"they\" so you don't know whether the killer is male or female, as if you wouldn't be able to tell) was able to do that while everybody's backs were turned. And then there's a horrible red herring where one character is set up as the killer. That character is chasing the other characters and shooting at them, and then . . . whaaaaa? You mean that's NOT the killer! WTF! Just avoid this movie, unless you're looking to see some slick camera work. That's what got this movie a three in my book, because the acting was terrible and the script was worse. But I'm willing to admit that it wouldn't have been as horrible if they had just released it when it was supposed to have been released. If you're into this kind of films,and enjoy enjoying films,you'll love this one.; As the previous comment said, it certainly serves its purpose. Mindhunters is one of these movies that show you that some people still making movies for what they are meant to do : entertain you! From what I've been reading quite often in imdb people tend to forget this. Anyway, down to business now. What I liked in Mindhunters was its speed. Never let you go. Right from the beginning, very nice opening imho, has your fullest attention. And when they go on the island, its party time! The plot gets even more interesting, you got questions popped up in your head as it goes and suddenly you get to be the profiler. You just cant stop guessing. The whole island set was terrific. Gives out this isolation feeling, being an isolated island of course, but at the same time it gets pretty spooky I think. Especially at night. I found its music to be very, very good. It starts with a very low and lyrical rythme, and as the story unfolds its gets more upbeat. The direction was just the right one. Not too much or too less of it. It had the right shots when they were needed, some fast ones were great, the acting was pretty decent, the script... Now as far as the script is concerned, it did have some plotholes. I don't know, maybe I didn't get some scenes, but I have the feeling that something went a bit wrong there. But that's definitely not going to ruin the feeling of the movie. This is a great movie for people who can enjoy films for what they are. If any of you has heard negative words, forget it, and just sit your butt down and watch it. If you're into this kind of films, and you really enjoy enjoying films, you gonna love this one. I'd give it a 8.5 out of 10 Good Movie; MindHunters is the best movie I've seen in a long time. This movie is was what a lot of movies should be keep you guessing through the whole film very good acting throughout the film I hope people do not dismiss this movie because it's really good and actually worth going to the movies and spending dollars to see. I really stopped going to the movies because I was tired of movies being hyped but when you see it you're really disappointed but this movie was really a surprise. SEE IT!!! Everyone has there own opinion that's true. Anyway this movie is good/not perfect but I feel when you watch a movie you want to be entertained and I feel that this movie did that. What you see is what you get...; It's the type of thriller that delivers just about what you should expect from uhm... this type of thriller and it isn't half bad. What makes it fun is some effective death scenes and at least one good surprise early in the movie (when the first of the team is killed off on the island). A lot of the plot film-buffs will see coming a mile away but it makes for a fun 90 minutes none the less. The cast is nice, the thrills are what you'd expect but still fun and that final duel is surprisingly brilliant. That's one time where I actually wouldn't mind keeping my head underwater. I would rate it 7 stars out of 10. Awful!; This is one of the most ridiculous and crappiest films I have ever seen. It contains some of the WORST acting you will see and that is on top of a plot which is thin to say the least. the cast are plain appalling. Don't waste your time on this crap! The first death is a joke with me actually thinking the thing was going to be someone dreaming before it got onto the proper story...it wasn't - from then on it it gets worse! Rent out SAW or SAW 2 or just go to bed...it really is that bad! Apparently this rant has to go on for ten lines which is why I typed this last sentence, the movie didn't justify another line though so hence the muttering last lines! Mindhunters - is a VERY!!!; It's impossible to understand why the most of these people, who said, that they watched this film and didn't like it, call themselves \"Real Movie Profy\". When I first watched an ATB's videoclip \"Marrakech\", I've understood: I must see this movie. I can't say anything about the movie special effects (may be some films have much more impressive graphics), but the atmosphere and the storyline of \"Mindhunters\" is so unbelievable, so mysterious, so interesting; the film's atmosphere keeps you in suspension from the very beginning to the last end. So, I think, that everybody, who didn't like it very much, doesn't even understand the real 'scary and mysterious' atmosphere of the REAL THRILLER! And what about a storyline of the film, may be sometimes it may seen like strange and may be some moments of storyline are not so perfectly made, but this film is the much more 'storylineous', than most of modern films. So, I can give you (for people who didn't like this movie or didn't understand it) a tip: \"Review this movie!\"... Flawed but Extremely Underrated Thriller.; This long delayed suspense thriller was filmed in 2002 and it is finally getting released in North America. The Premise of Mindhunters is a good one. The Story is about Seven Promising FBI Profilers (Kathryn Morris, Jonny Lee Miller, Clifton Collins Jr., Patricia Velasquez, Eion Bailey, Will Kemp and Christian Slater) are becoming F.B.I. Agents but they have to finish one last course to become full time agents. Their Captain (Val Kilmer) is sending them to an island that is completely isolated. The students last training is profiling the fictional Serial Killer by the name of The Puppeteer. The students are sent to the island along with an mysterious law officer (LL Cool a.k.a-James Todd Smith). Once they are on that island, they are alone and forced to play the game. But when one of the profilers dies, then the game turns real and they are forced to profile each other. Also who so the real killer in this island or it is One of Them in the group ? This entertaining film is directed by Renny Harlin (Exorcist:The Beginning, Die Hard 2:Die Harder, Cliffhanger). Harlin shows some strong visual style and the film is surprisingly suspenseful. Although this thriller has at times an uneasy mix of a slasher film. The film suffers some predicable moments. But the film does have a few memorable death scenes. This film nearly went Direct to Video back in 2004, because Miramax/Dimension Films didn't know how to market the film and Harlin kept re-editing the film by finding the right pace for this thriller. 20th Century Fox wanted to buy the film from Miramax/Dimension Films but the Weinstein brothers, who own Miramax/Dimensnion Films didn't want to sell the film. This film went to be released in Overseas before it open in North America. This Film-Mindhunters received some critical notices from several top critics. Mindhunters was probably a mess, while filming and Miramax/Dimension Films could never give the film a release date starting from early winter-2003. The film is finally released in North America on May 13, 2005. When the film is finally released in the U.S., the film turned into a Box Office flop. Mindhunters will probably be released to DVD, anytime soon and the film should grow to be a Cult Favorite. Let's hope upcoming DVD release of this film should have an audio commentary track by Harlin, Deleted Scenes and Alternative Endings. Region one DVD doesn't have Deleted Scenes or Alternative Ending but it does have an interesting audio commentary track by the director and three featurettes. This is Certainly Harlin's best film, since the underrated \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\". Harlin is also One of the film's Executive Producers. Super 35. (****/*****). This Season of Survivor is All FBI, All Action, All Idiots; Director Renny Harlin is very much a paracinematic man, and his particular brand of style fits perfectly in the early 2000s aesthetic of excess. High concept thrillers such as Speed rely on an exponentially thrilling pace. Moving the plot along faster than the viewer brain can comprehend the inherent silliness of the core concept. Since Fincher's Se7en, thrillers have taken the macabre turn in the crime genre. Reaching the point of Wan's Saw set within one of those trials of torture. Mindhunters similarly attempts the same zenith, upping Se7en's police duo with a ragtag team of FBI agents, racing to solve an ongoing test of intelligence and insanity. Despite the blatant exposition and character development, none of these people seem smarter than Pitt's hardheaded detective. The agents muster a fun mix of \"oh, they've come a long way since\" and \"oh... who?\" Notable entertainers here are Johnny Lee Miller sporting his best Blanche DuBois, Christian Slater and Val Kilmer competing in their natural friendly-yet-suspicious-yet-bored acting styles, and LL Cool J acting as if he was John McClane in yet another preposterous scenario. Attempting to outdo predecessors with 'bigger is better', the story takes place on an isolated island complete with an entire city simulation for a training exercise. According to their teacher, representative of \"the mind of a sociopath\", presumably not meaning laughably inane and ridiculously convenient for the killer's grand scheme. The film, of course, never slows down to let you question how the entire plot hinges of this arbitrary setting. The script of Mindhunters is definitely where entertainment hinges on as Harlin desperately races ahead of logic and common sense. For such a complex and convoluted mystery build, there are a remarkable number of legitimate plant and pay-offs. Many of them are obvious enough to predict despite the suspension of disbelief being thoroughly tested. Much how Jigsaw relies on sheer chance amidst his philosophical soliloquies, a great number of set-pieces and foreshadowing relies on pure coincidence. The script is constantly testing whether these characters are supposed geniuses outmatched or merely idiots outwitted by another idiot. One particular if insignificant moment of clumsy writing is the repeated mantra of a situation only being secure \"on the drive home\", the heroes of course proving this right... when boarding a helicopter to safety. Could've easily been fixed for \"on the way home\" but it doesn't affect the story. In a world of post-modern, meta-narrative ironies, Harlin is successful in his sheer earnestness for pure, dumb, entertainment. For a film about investigative geniuses battling a criminal mastermind, it's best to leave your brain at the door. Wow!; I can't understand why this movie ain't have about 8 points in IMDb... and why everybody say that it's a bad movie, when it actually is Harlin's best movie (even better than Deep Blue Sea) I enjoyed it really much... I was totally surprised at the end... I thin that many of those who give this film 1-6 points don't really now what are saying or didn't understand the film or maybe just hate some actor in the film and that's why they give so stupid points. This movie even scared me and I never would though that it's really that good movie!! but I don't want to tell anything from the movie because I don't want to spoil your movie experience. Sorry if my language is not so good but I hope you understand what I try to tell you... Great movie, everybody must see this masterpiece. One of the best movies I ever have seen in this kind of genre. I give 9/10 for this movie. They were hunting minds, but they forgot to bring their own; Renny Harlin isn't exactly known for making intelligent movies, but at least they're usually quite enjoyable. \"Mindhunters\", however, is so utterly stupid that it's hard to get any kind of enjoyment out of it, apart from maybe some unintentionally funny bits. The concept behind Mindhunters (group of people get stuck somewhere with a killer on the loose) is OK, and it has lead to some exciting movies in the past, including Harlin's own \"Deep Blue Sea\", which, while also very stupid, at least didn't take itself seriously. Unfortunately, \"Mindhunters\" does. And that's were the problems start. \"Mindhunters\" is about a group of supposedly talented FBI trainees getting stuck on an island. Before long, a mysterious killer starts killing them off one by one, using increasingly more elaborate traps (think \"Final Destination\"). The first problem with this is that the traps that are used are so ridiculously complicated and depend on so much circumstances that in real life, they would have a one in a billion chance of succeeding. They would also take hours to set up, time that simply no character has since they're all together almost all the time. Next, although the main characters are supposed to be trained professionals, they immediately crack up after the first murder, and start panicking and wildly accusing each other for so reason whatsoever. Yeah right. The list of implausibilities and plot holes goes on and on, right up to the conclusion that makes no sense whatsoever, and seems to be there only for shock value. All of this might have worked if the movie hadn't taken itself so seriously, or if there had been any other redeeming qualities. There aren't. The acting is poor, none of the characters are even remotely interesting or even likable, and there's hardly any humor in the entire movie (in spite of LL Cool J's presence). The only small point of light in this mess are some of the murders, which, granted, are fairly spectacular. \"Mindhunters\" is a movie that asks of you to completely abstain from using your brain for about over one and a half hours, for only a couple of seconds of gore. If you ask me, that's a pretty poor trade-off. There's nothing wrong with a bit of mindless entertainment, but this goes beyond any reasonable limit. *1/2 out of ***** His Weakness..Bulletts....; A group of seven FBI trainees are sent to an isolated island for the final stage of their training period, under the direction of eccentric Jake Harris, who uses questionable methods. However, they are attacked and killed by a serial killer,whom is one of the team members. The tension increases amidst the group with the lack of confidence on each other...Renny Harlin hasn't really made an impact with movies since the long kiss goodnight, and I for think his career never really got over 'Cutthroat Island' or Geena Davis. Here he gets the best B-movie actors of the year, and makes something which is not dissimilar to 2002's Stallone movie D-Tox. But instead of them sharing the same problem, here they are targeted for their 'weaknesses', which is a novel idea, but since the best kill is the first one and the most famous actor in the whole thing (bar Kilmer) it soon loses it's pace along the way. The editing is dire, and really affects the film in some scenes, but thanks to the performances from the cast, the film is watchable enough for it to warrant a second viewing eight years down the line, because to be honest, your only going to remember Slater being frozen in half.. If not for COLD CASE, would probably not be released; First heard about this movie from an article in FANGORIA magazine a couple years back. Finally saw it last year on a bootleg DVD. It was definitely derivative, but fairly enjoyable. The acting was decent--the biggest problem is the weak screenplay. There is a fair amount of suspense, and some grisly (though physically impossible) murder scenes. I believe MINDHUNTERS is getting a theatrical release here mainly to capitalize on the popularity of Kathryn Morris, who is currently starring in COLD CASE on CBS. I've only seen one commercial for MINDHUNTERS so far, so I don't know if the ad campaign will single her out or not. Does what it needs.; It never seizes to amaze me why certain people choose to overly criticize a movie that is clearly made for the sole purpose of entertaining you for a couple of hours. Mindhunters delivers exactly what it promises, a nice thriller that works moviewize rather well, sure it is nothing new or incredible but does it have to be ? I found it a nice way to relax in comfy theater seats munching popcorn while at it, there was no perticular scene or place in the movie that made me wince, it worked from start to end well. Forget the nay sayers and just go enjoy it. Some of the stuff in this film is so over the top; I saw this last year and thought that some of it was so over the top it was unbelievable, the 'anti smoking' bit would be a harrowing advert! Yeah some of the deaths are a bit overdone but it's a good movie I enjoyed it, thought it was pretty good, and kept me guessing etc etc, the acting and directing was good I think any major problems is a writers fault more then the cast/crew! My friends thought it was good too so its not just a personal opinion but yeah like any movie its gonna have people who love it and people who hate it its the same with any film made right? But yes I gave it a 5/10 and maybe I was being a little harsh but it's worth a watch! Just When you think you've got it figured out, you don't; This is a very entertaining thriller/suspense movie that keeps you thinking and hooked right up until the very end. If for some reason you realize you won't be able to finish this movie then turn it off within the first half hour. because after the first half hour you will be absolutely hooked until the very end. trust me you will not figure this one out unless you pay extreme attention to detail and even more to plot and characteristics. Pesronally i do pay extreme attention to detail and this movie surprised me. Mindhunters has it's flaws and it is very graphicly violent so i give it a 9 out of 10. Incredibly stupid way of wasting your time; I can't believe I sat thru the entire movie but maybe it was because of my wife. A whodunnit so-called-thriller edited MTV-style for the teens just to keep you believing that time is running involves 7 FBI wannabe profilers on a drill getting killed one by one in very ingenious and clever ways. You got no time to get in the mood, no time to get to know them better, no time to admire the shots and you wonder how the hell the killer got time to set up all the traps. At the end, I shaked my head in disbelief at the Talking Killer-scene...the whole movie is a pathetic attempt at the whodunnit-genre. okay pot boiler; Hard to believe that Christian Slater was once a big star looking at this, he is reduced to a semi-cameo in a \"B\" picture. It's an okay set up, group of FBIers being picked off by booby traps with the twist that the people in question are warned of the time the next trap will go off. There is an evil genius obviously at work and the people being to suspect each other. You need to suspend disbelieve but if you are willing to do that it's okay. The traps are always every involved and the people are always standing in a particular spot. The traps aren't like claymore mines that take out a whole group but are targeted at a specific spot where someone is standing. Since the buildings are booby trapped why do they stay there? Why doesn't the FBI screen it's people better? Why does the test have to take place with all communication cut off? What if someone had a burst appendix? Why do the people not suspect anything when something happens that it's obvious the \"puppet master\" wants them to take action on? Still think Christian Slater could do better if given a chance. Frighteningly stereotypical; I was enjoying myself through about 20% of the film. Then I realized that even though I've never seen this film before, never read about it, or even seen the poster, I've seen it a hundred times. The last 80% were easily predicted by looking back at every slasher film, lousy thriller and wannabe psycho thriller that's been released the last 10 years. The plot and script is so thin that it couldn't take much more than a day or two to reinvent completely, and the movie seems to rely only on gory details for entertainment and \"suspense\". The only reason I give this film a few points is that ONE scene during the whole movie managed to catch me off guard, and even surprised me a bit. If you're utterly desperate to watch a movie - any movie - and don't have anything else available in the house, this film may be OK to watch. Other than that; don't touch it with a ten-foot pole. Bloody brilliant; I like movies that keep me guessing, this one had me going all the way through. I was glued to my seat and really fell in love with all the characters. The way the plot opened up was pretty special its a real work of art the way the scripts and the directing come together. I loved the darkness and the constant guessing \"is it you, because you said that\" sort of thing. TOTALLY did not expect that ending at all it came as quite a shock, it was so well written that even i didn't guess who it was although i think that because of the way the writers didn't know who it was going to be until the last moment kind of helped out there. If you can get past the slight gore in the movie its dam good and well worth seeing. Marina:) A very good thriller.; Mindhunters is a very good thriller with lots of shocks, scares and surprises. There is a lot of suspense and unexpected jumps. The thing I like about this movie is that it makes you think that one person is the bad guy then you find out it is not and then the next person is suspected for being the bad guy. In other words, there are a lot of red herrings and lot of mystery to it. The plot of this movie. A group of FBI profiler trainees are sent to a military island facility to train their profiling abilities and teamwork. But when one of their teammates is killed during a supposed simulation, they try to get off the island. Then they begin to suspect that the killer is among them. I like the cinematography of this movie. This movie has a very good look to it. The acting is also very well done. Especially Kathryn Morris. And hands off to LL Cool J. In every scene he is in, he just brings in a lot of life to them. That is how good he is. If you like mindhunters, I would recommend copycat. Whaaaa?; This movie is ridiculous. I saw it at the dollar theater. I think it was definitely worth $1, if only for how hilarious it was. I have to say the first death is the best. Liquid nitrogen causing a man to freeze and break off at the ankles? I saw the movies with a group of chemistry majors; I think we disturbed the whole theater with our laughter. Also the acid laced cigarette. It seemed to keep eating through her body even after she fell in the water. Hydrofluoric maybe? All in all this movie was entertaining. The only aspect I found irritating was the constant accusations that went on throughout the film (especially directed towards LL Cool J). Too much back and forth yelling and screaming. Best part is when LL shoots holds in the wall to use for a sweet traverse climb. Rock on LL. The FBI killing the FBI...; Seven FBI trainees are training to become elite profilers, in order to succedd they have to do a training simulation on an island where they are supposed to find a serial killer, of course the mission is just a game to see who handles situations in the best way possible. But the game quickly changes to fatal reality when someone takes the game too seriously. Now the quickly decreasing number of seven people have to find out who's setting up traps for them on the island but it's not that easy when they're the only ones on the island. Well the plot is something I suppose, a serial killer picking off the FBI trainees one by one, instead of using the usual Knife, Machete or Chainsaw, this killer cleaverly uses specially timed inventive traps, you see this Killer has studied each member of the trainees habits and so knows what can kill them, they're goal is to try find out who this killer is and play him or her at they're own game, before they all end up dead. \"Mindhunters\" has a number of famous faces such as rapper/singer/actor LL Cool J (Deep Blue Sea Halloween (HZO), Christian Slater (Broken Arrow &amp; Alone In The Dark), Val Kilmer (Top Gun &amp; Batman Forever), Johnny Lee Miller (Trainspoting), Kathryn Norris (Minorty Report and TV'S Cold Case) and Patrica Velaquez (The Mummy Returns) Being the slasherfan that I am, it's nice to be able to enjoy a slasher where the killer doesn't wear a mask and the cast doesn't consist of a bunch of good looking teens who can't act. Not having these two factors, just proves that the story is stronger than most modern slashers, it's a shame that movie ended being shevled for years and wasn't a success at the box office but to me that doesn't matter because this is one hell of gem of a movie. Each cast member brings they're own unique talent to the roles of this movie, yes even LL Cool J who I don't think much of as a singer, but in this movie he plays a strong lead character in this movie, Christian Slater is also solid in his short screen time, Johnny Lee Miller shows depths to his character as the movie goes on and both the female leads are great as well Kathryn Norris plays cat and mouse with the unknown killer and plays the killer at his own game. The deaths in this movie are cool and inventive, we get a guy iced then breaks into pieces, a decapitation, a guy gets speared through the chest and we also get something completely new death by cigarettes, laced with acid and let's just say smoking is bad for your health. All in all there's a little something for everyone in this movie, there's the horror, action and a bit of CSI, well recommend this movie to anyone. A very intelligent movie; I saw the DVD tonight. I consider this one of the finest psychological thrillers since \"se7en\". The movie is brilliantly written and directed. The story proves itself; you don't need mega stars to sell it. The plot is not flawless, but it is convincing. It keeps the audiences guessing till the end. Without reveal much of the story, I have to give the credit about how the killer is been revealed. Surprise, Surprise! To director, Renny Harlin, you have finally redeemed yourself from your last flopped \"Driven\". Leave your mind at home; If LL Cool J is in a film it means that acting skills are optional. The rest of the film requires you to believe that someone had the remarkable ability to set all the events up knowing the script in advance. Because the events that occur could only have happened if you could see the script in advance. So these clowns are supposed to be FBI agents. Yet vending machines magically dispense things in a highly suspicious fashion and the agent is not surprised by this? This is a true idiot's delight. Sadly this has every type of amateur associated with it. There are truly horrible elements created solely just to create screams from the audience. It probably took a crew time to set up that scene, but somehow we're supposed to believe that the killer was able to set up this entire elaborate scene all by himself. And then the great finale, which would have made Jacques Cousteau envious. It's a comedy in the absurd. Leave it to these clowns to take exaggeration to the max. It takes a special type of low talent hack to come up with this pitiful waste of film. I give it a 3 for the actors who try to do what they can with this script. They weren't terrible, just made to do some very dumb things. A great Harlin picture; I can't remember when last enjoyed watching a picture by Renny Harlin but this was truly a good movie. This thriller is everything You want from thriller: surprising, speedy and exciting. Harlin is proved his skills as a action-director already with Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger but in my opinion this is his best movie and it's a pity that the studio executives don't trust Renny, well he has made some awful movies in his time but he has potential, this movie for example is a very beautiful one, a virtue normally not connected with Harlin pictures. I feel sorry for Harlin that this movie never got into theaters in the US. It certainly would have deserved a chance. Silly But Entertaining; \"Mindhunters\" is a silly, but highly entertaining mystery. The real mystery is why the movie was delayed for two years by Dimension Films. The plot: 7 FBI profilers are put on an remote island for training about serial killers. Little do they know that a real killer is on the loose tracking them one by one. Not killing them outright, but setting traps. The mystery aspect of the film is different and there are a lot of twists. The deaths are also original. SPOILERS BELOW!!!!! Slater's and Kilmer's death are the standouts. Slater's character is the first victim who gets frozen by liquid nitrogen and shatters into pieces. Kilmer's character was strung up with hooks like a puppet. The only problem with the movie is the ending. It's very lame and it hurts the film greatly. But if you don't take the movie too seriously, you'll enjoy it. For more insanity, please visit: comeuppancereviews.com *PUBLIC HEALTH WARNING: This movie causes severe and irreparable brain damage!*; Heir in are no spoilers. Why would I say that? Because even telling you a few of the many many things that are intolerably irritating in this movie might already cause you to bash your head against the next wall. There are obviously good movies and bad movies. In the bad movie department there are such movies as `Hercules in New York' which are so bad that you are constantly giggling and making fun of them. This movie here is in fact so very bad, you can't even do that. Far from it! It's",
       " just plain pain!!! It is supposed to be about FBI profilers, which means they had quite extensive police AND psychological education. You would suspect that because of that the characters would come up with logical conclusions, be patient, observant, have good and well balanced psychological standpoints and be intelligent people. You find nothing of that here; in fact this is the hell crew which is pumped up with testosterone to max level, with 20 years of steroid addiction and pea-sized spam brains! There is no logic to ANY of the events depicted and the killer they are supposed to hunt down is no better. This movie is so completely brimming over with implausibility that a major LSD trip would actually make you understand Teletubbies better than it would this movie! And to add the icing on this",
       " `cake': After a while it becomes extremely predictable. If you like this movie, remember to NEVER EVER invite me to any kind of movie night at your house, because I would end up smashing down anything in my way to get out as fast as possible! It deserves to be on absolute zero! (In Fahrenheit that would be -459 which it actually deserves a lot more!) I can sadly enough only give it a 1, that's the worst I can do besides writing this worst review of my life and I will be crying for weeks now that I couldn't give that movie less points than that! Save your soul, your mind, your future and your health. If you see this movie in a shelf: Look away.  If somebody wants to watch it: Run for your life!!! It is not worth the damage it can cause you, your family, pet, car, toothbrush, it is not worth your time and it will defiantly not amuse you or even make you laugh or anything. It will only cost you your dignity; will diminish your intellect and slap you right across the face! I feel proud to be able to warn the public about this horrible piece of",
       " *add any bad word of your liking*. I should get the Nobel Peace Prize for this warning actually!! Well, I bet I get it! So be ready the next time they show the awards, I'll be the guy with long hair and glasses! Terrible Movie; What floored me the most was how the FBI agents acted through out the movie. Let's face it, if these are supposed to be Americas best then no wonder they couldn't stop 9/11. Each of them acted like a 20 year college student instead of a professional FBI agent. There was arguing, fighting, finger pointing, and just plain silly thinking. Not once did they ever stop and try to analyze the situation and find a solution out of their situation. I had to laugh when one of the agents suggested that another should shoot a handcuffed suspect, so that they wouldn't have to worry about her anymore. I'm sure that would have looked good on the IL'resume. In the end I found the movie a complete waste of time. Another weak excuse to show gore and torture; Let's see: A group of folks (in this case FBI agents training to be serial killer profilers) are thrown together on an island to solve a simulation. Oh, wait: suddenly they realize it's not a simulation. Wait again: one of them may be the killer. Wait a 3rd time: one by one they are killed off, each new killing pointing to a different member. And, yup, the killings are really nasty with folks beheaded, burned by acid and (especially) strung up by wire and fish hooks. A serious actor like Kilmer should be ashamed of participating in worthless sh*t such as this. When are folks going to stop supporting movies like this, Seven, Silence of the Lambs, and other gory cr*p? This is nothing more that a shallow excuse to show excessive torture and nastiness. We've got enough of that in the real world. Let's not keep feeding it. What's especially sad about these kinds of movies is the high percentage of women who enjoy them. Women are fighting hard to stop violence at home, in the workplace and on the streets. Suggest you start pushing Hollywood too and stop encouraging this garbage. Utter nonsense, but fun anyway.; A team of aspiring FBI profilers are flown to a remote island called Oneiga where others of their kind are trained. Overseen by an eccentric supervisor, Harris (Val Kilmer), their skills are put to the ultimate test when it seems that one of them has caught the killing bug themselves. And this psychopath knows just how to play to the skills and weaknesses of each character. Tensions flare among the group when they take turns suspecting each other. Renny Harlin, director of such epics as \"Die Hard 2\" and \"Cliffhanger\", is clearly the right kind of guy for this sort of popcorn fare. It's pretty slick stuff, and the story *is* entertaining if also ridiculous at every turn. It's shot in a visually stark manner, with an almost monochromatic look. The production design by Charles Wood is pretty damn impressive. Things get rather gory at times, but suspense is minimal. Although the screenplay by Wayne Kramer (director of \"The Cooler\" and \"Running Scared\" (2006)) is always taking turns making characters look suspicious, ultimately the big reveal is not terribly surprising. This viewer was reminded of John Carpenters' \"The Thing\" while watching (there's even a blood testing plot point). The closest thing that the story has to a likable, sympathetic character is Sara Moore (Kathryn Morris); there just aren't that many people here worth giving a damn about. Not that the actors can be faulted. Morris is an appealing lead, while LL Cool J is given the opportunity to show off his physique, commit heroic acts, and basically be a bad ass. Eion Bailey, Clifton Collins Jr., Will Kemp, Jonny Lee Miller, Christian Slater, and Patricia Velasquez co-star. Slater has quite a memorable departure from the story. Overall, this is rather silly, but it entertains in its own crazed way. Seven out of 10. \"Are you having fun? I'm having fun.\"; When 'Mindhunters' finally made it's plunge into the movie theaters, I didn't get around to see it. It was released the same week as a couple of other more appealing films and I guess I just missed it on my 'to watch' list. For the longest time I figured this was a positive thing because of the film's extremely negative buzz. 'Mindhunters', the mind-teasing thriller about six wannabe F.B.I. profilers being stalked, toyed with and murdered one by one during a field exercise, was supposed to be released in 2002, but didn't get released until early this year. When a movie is delayed release for three years it can really only mean one thing -- it is unbelievably dreadful. I rented a copy of 'Mindhunters' while on vacation in Spain two weeks ago only because it was the only new film available I didn't already see. I was expecting it to be pure trash not only because of all the distribution problems and delays, but because it was directed by one of Hollywood's most overrated and talentless hacks, Renny Harlin (remember Cutthroat Island, YUCK!). When the film was over, I have to tell you I was pleasantly surprised. 'Mindhunters' isn't a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it entertains and offers cheesy but very fun plot twists. If you can just watch it without analyzing it, I assure all the action/gore fans out there that they will enjoy it. I know I did. The movie follows seven F.B.I. profilers in training -- Sara (Kathryn Morris - TV's 'Cold Case'), Lucas (Jonny Lee Miller - Trainspotting), Bobby (Eion Bailey - HBO's 'Band of Brothers'), Vince (Clifton Collins, Jr. - Traffic), Rafe (Will Kemp - Van Helsing), Nicole (Patricia Velasquez - The Mummy) and J.D. (Christian Slater - Windtalkers). They are led by a tough-as-nails and dry-witted F.B.I. Psychological Profiling Trainer with unorthodox methods, Jake Harris (Val Kilmer - Spartan). Jake takes his protégés to a deserted island owned by the F.B.I. for field exercises, to put them through a final test. They will be alone on the island and will be required to solve and complete certain obstacles. Joining the seven profilers in training is the L.A.P.D.'s Gabe Jensen (LL Cool J - S.W.A.T.) who is sent from headquarters to pick up a few things from the training program. When the eight souls are alone on the island, what they think to be the training exercise begins. When one of the eight is killed, they realize it's not a training exercise at all and someone is after them. But there is only one problem -- they are the only people on the island. That is when the real mystery and fun starts to get rolling in Renny Harlin's 'Mindhunters', one of the better films on Harlin's resume. I actually enjoyed 'Mindhunters', but I wouldn't call it a good film. It keeps you entertained, but hardly anything in the movie is original. Renny Harlin really does a so-so job directing (nothing too bad, but nothing too great either). The script is full of exhilarating and thrilling moments, but it is also jammed to the brim with tired and overused scenarios, painful to listen to dialogue and some really hoaky one-liners that you'd expect to see in an 80s Canadian Made-For-TV crime caper starring Corey Haim or Kirk Cameron. The acting is a mixed bag in 'Mindhunters', with top of the line performances from Kilmer and Slater, bottom of the barrel performances from Clifton Collins, Jr. and Patricia Velasquez, strictly average performances from Bailey and Kemp, a slightly above average performance from Kathryn Morris (the hero of the story), a more or less good performance from rapper turned actor LL Cool J and a beyond disappointing performance from the great British actor Jonny Lee Miller (once married to Hollywood psychopath Angelina Jolie) who provides us with an embarrassingly bad American accent that drifts from American to British to Southern to various unintelligible accents. I recommend renting 'Mindhunters' when it comes to American video stores if you are looking for mindless fun and don't mind some graphic and gritty aftermaths of violent deaths and a few kitty cat corpses. Grade: C+ my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces). A Bloated Mess Of A Film...; I watched MINDHUNTERS with a group of people whose sole basis for the success of a film depends on whether or not they could figure out who the \"bad guy\" was.  They could not, so they deemed it a \"very good\" movie, much to my chagrin.  They seemed to completely miss the fact that nowhere in MINDHUNTERS do the film-makers make any attempt at a plausible story line or characters that have any kind of dimension at all.  The screenwriter creates flat confused pawns that inhabit a hopelessly labyrinthine world that defies all bounds of logic.  The viewer not only has to suspend disbelief, but must place it in a wastepaper basket and burn it. O.K., the story as I remember it:  A group of trainees for the F.B.I. (or some other stock agency that would result in training on an abandoned island) go to an abandoned island.  The mastermind of the group is a guy played by Val Kilmer (in a glorified cameo that receives top billing), and a bunch of other people (amongst them Christian Slater and L.L. Cool J.) who fall victim to elaborate traps--most of which would have have taken an entire day to set up, although the cast is together on screen most of the time.  Does that mean the killer isn't one of the group?  Who cares?  I don't want reveal any of the implausible plot twists (except the ones I reveal below); they have to be seen to be believed anyway.  It would take more time to rationalize this festering spaghetti bowl of a movie then I really would like to dedicate to such an amateurish and laughable film. Examples and !!**SPOILERS**!!:  One of the group is dying for a cigarette. While out walking by herself, with a killer on the loose, she notices a pack of smokes fall out of the machine.  Well, what does she do?  Realizes the obvious trap that has been set?  No...she smokes one and dies horribly. Huh?  Apparently the future members of this elite shadowy agency are half-wits that deserve to die.  It just goes on and on like this for the length of the film.  This is even worse than director Renny Harlin's previous film STRIKING DISTANCE, and that was a pretty god-awful piece of crap. Anyway, if you like being tricked by a movie (even at the cost of honest characters and a clever plot), then MINDHUNTERS fits the bill.  But, if you are opposed to be shamelessly manipulated by a witless and obvious thriller...stay far away from this disaster.  1/10. Surprisingly Entertaining; Knowing Renny Harlin's track record, you never know what to expect from the Finnish director. It seems it's more or less random which of his films turn out to be crap or really quite good. I didn't know what to expect here, and maybe my low expectations were part of the reason why i found this film to be surprisingly entertaining. The setup is pretty standard-fare for a serial-killer film. What makes this different is the victims. They are FBI-agents in training to become profilers. Their teacher is Jake Harris (Val Kilmer) who likes to use special methods while training his agents. As a test the profilers-to-be are sent out to an army training facility on a desolate island. A small town is built on the island and the morning after their arrival a murder will have happened in the town, their job is to find the killer. Something goes wrong however and it seems the game has become real, a killer really is on the loose and now he's chasing them. To say that this story is unbelievable and forced is an understatement. The whole set-up with an abandoned island feels a bit cheap, a lame excuse to get the agents alone in a place from which there is no escape. But if you can accept that particular bit of plot then the rest is not bad at all. The atmosphere is well built and the suspense is thick. Also most of the actors do a pretty good job creating that \"anyone-could-be-guilty\"-feeling. So, even though the serial-killer thing has been done a thousand times and even though the set-up here is even less believable than usual, this is still an enjoyable experience. It might not be revolutionary, and it might not be something you'll remember for very long. But if you like this kind of movie you will at least be entertained for as long as it lasts. I rate it 6/10. Is it ethical to use a serial killer to prove your point?; Such a film is to be discovered directly. There is no possible summarizing it without destroying its force and its effect. Let's say seven young FBI agents are being trained to become profilers. The teacher is harsh with them because he seems to find them too weak. The last test is to drop them on a totally abandoned and deserted island announcing there is a serial killer with them. And they have three or four days to profile him or her, and what's more they have a chaperon from the Department of Justice. Good luck, Good bye and Good adventure ahead. And they discover very fast there is a serial killer among them, but they do not know who. And there everything goes wrong for them. Thank you Agatha Christie and her \"Ten Little N***s\", or \"Murder By Death\" used as models. The details are in the film. The film demonstrates how these young agents have none of the necessary qualities to become profilers, and particularly the capacity to remain cool, cold and self controlled if they don't want to fall in the traps the serial killer is laying in front of them. And lose their cool they all will, dramatically and pay for their mistake with their lives. But the best profiler of them all is absent, it is the teacher who had profiled the serial killer among them and knew this one will not stop at anything at all to be the only one to survive and get the degree. But we could wonder if that is not a subtle way of being a killer too: by using the unconscious and unsolicited services of a real killer to prove his point: these young people are not serious future profilers and have to be eliminated. And that brings the film to the level of a metaphor of society. Only the best one survives any test, or the survivor of an elimination game is the best one. True or False? The film leans towards true. I think it could have been slightly more subtle. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines This would be awesome if you had never seen a mystery/thriller before...; ...but, as I have seen mysteries and thrillers before, this movie ends up a few tacos short of a combo meal in the grand scheme of things. It's pretty good though, and it was a very entertaining watch. The characters are fleshed out pretty well and the plot is well executed. The setting is great, and you're kept in due suspense at who exactly is the killer for the first hour or two of the movie. The acting is generally okay, and there's a good use of atmosphere here. I did like how each character was given their own strengths and weaknesses to be used against them, that was good. And the special effects were cool sometimes, but lame at others. But this movie tries to do too much, reaching for heights it can't quite grasp. It's all very well done, but towards they end they start throwing in so many 'plot twists' that it gets really predictable and irritating. We've seen most of these type of plot twists before, and although they're done well, there was no need to do it so many damn times and drag out the ending of the movie for another 20 minutes. Other random gripes: The gore often looked terribly fake The action wasn't that good. Looked genuinely fake as well. But overall I liked it alright. It's not a classic, but it does a pretty okay job for this type of film. Fans of the genre won't find anything new, but they will find an enjoyable 'popcorn' type of mystery flick. Recommended. DO NOT EVEN THINK ON THIS FILM; This is one of the worst films seen lately by mankind. Don't repeat my mistake and waste 90 minutes of your life on it. Every frame of it is like a nail in your eyes, brain, taste and hope in cinema as art. The plot is predictable, the cast is not worthy (but for LL Cool J, whose work is almost acceptable- wow, beautiful body, mate-), dialogs are empty and exist only to make the plot survive, ad-hoc editing, too much like an MTV video; a film based only on effects. By effects I mean loud noise when the director needs tension, but no tension filmed at all. That kind of effect. Simply put, it seems like the director is always thinking \"Hey, my audience might fall in deep sleep, so I better put in much noise and easy explanations of the plot\". I guess you won't like it if you feel insulted like that. *****POSSIBLE SPOILER***** Characters just fool around until they're killed. The killer is poorly explained and lacks of anything remotely resembling a three-dimensional personality. Go and do something better with your life and you money, you won't regret it. Stood The Test Of Time; Sometimes, I wonder why such awesome films as Mindhunters was bashed by film critics and was a flop in theaters. Released in 2004, it has stood the test of time well and is viewed very fresh and well now. The reason - shorter time, excellent cast, with Jonny Lee Miller, Kathryn Morris and LL Cool J among the best, excellent pacing and very good camera work. I do recommend this FBI mouse-cat-whodunnit-drama as it offers many thrills and holds you at the edge of your seat. Excellent nail-biting thriller where you never guess who the main culprit is till the very end. It is also fine for its correct dark navy color scheme and very menacing cold atmosphere of fear and suspicion. My rate is 10 A gruesome cinematic gem; Who could have seen this coming? After years of sitting on a shelf and picking up a nasty rep, \"Mindhunters\" has blitzed theaters outside the US. To my surprise the film is actually cult classic material and not a bomb in the least. \"Mindhunters\" has a narrative akin to a bullet train at mach speed that nearly flies off the track into the abyss, but does not and in the process becomes a cinematic gem for the true fan of the genre. I am shocked (after seeing \"Mindhunters\") that this is not getting support in North America, as it has potential to do very well as it has here. Excellent flick. Four stars out of five good actors \"cook\" an excellent thriller; This movie is an example of a good thriller recipe. It has a graduate suspense, you never know how things will evolve and if you think you do, you are wrong. It combines psychological hints with rising terror and the result is breathtaking. Most of the actors are well known and this story could happen in real life too, producers didn't exaggerate the elements much out of the ordinary. The location of the action, a deserted island, is great for the plot, as it provides several different sceneries giving diversity to the action. The characters are well outlined, each has his/her personality, habits or weakness that define them. The actors also spice up the characters and have been well chosen for this movie. The tension increases and it never stops,not even at the end, you keep watching out for traps until the final minute. So I recommend you see it and I am sure even the most critical ones of you will at least enjoy it! Affable if vacuous time-waster; Renny Harlin once more gathers up a cast of has beens and never-were's to play out the \"And then there were none\" suspense dynamics he tested out on Deep Blue Sea. As usual with Renny, it all goes by at a fair enough pace and looks nice, but it's best to check your brain on the way in. This time the incredibly daft high concept plot has a gang of misfit serial killer profilers taken to an island by Val Kilmer's super profiler professor, who's in need of a haircut. Once there, the exercise turn serious as one of them is revealed to be a serial killer themselves. The gradually diminishing pool of profilers have to figure out who before they meet their own ends thanks to the ridiculously, comically over-elaborate traps left by the killer. who prays on their weaknesses. The main flaw is just how stupidly elaborate those evil death traps are - never mind a couple of hours, some would take an engineering and electronics degree and a few days. And being world domino champion would help. The cast does okay, without anyone standing out. Some of the characters do some really dumb and out of character things in order to keep Renny's shock machine on the move. It's not going to change your life or give you bad dreams, but it's not bad. Harlin will have to raise his game at some point though, if he really expects to keep getting gigs. A TV show is also in the offing. Presumably this will take forward the \"group of profilers\" angle rather than the \"getting a bunch of people onto an island and killing them\" one, as it's likely to be more sustainable. Utter nonsense; This film is poorly made and entirely uninteresting. No character is ever developed beyond a cardboard cutout and so no character is actually interesting. The monotony of a stupidly contrived drama where characters die one by one - in itself such a tired device - makes the very hook as to who in fact is behind the killings non-existent. Who cares ? And doubly so when for even those of us who absented themselves from all science classes throughout their schooling recognise the killing 'traps' as completely implausible and absurd. The chasms of illogic, which have left discerning audiences weeping with laughter and a right to demand the return of monies paid with interest, receive a hasty and unbelievable explanation from the killer in act 3. One can almost hear the rumblings of the dimwitted story telling minds behind this extravaganza of crappy horror trying to ensure the film at least had some credible base. The group responsible for this heap of festering excreta surely must have included cynical investors, the creatively challenged and hunters of the mindless. Great Movie.Great Death Scenes!; This film was good as hell.The death scene where the best since Final Destination 1 &amp; 2.All though I didn't finish watching it,but from what I watch,it was good as hell. This flick is about an F.B.I. training task team,who are put on a romote island to train.There mission is to catch an fake killer named The Puppeter.But something's wrong,people are really dying and the ones who are left are trying to find out who the killer is.Is it one of them,is it a real killer,is it something monstrous.Watch it and find out. I didn't finish watching it,so I don't know who the killer is.But from what I watch it is sweet.The death scene are brillant and scary.I thought I was watching a horror film when I seen this,because I jumped every time somebody died.Great film and great death scenes. Formulaic, but fun; I watched this last night and throughly enjoyed it. Shot with a similar style and flair to Harlins Deep Blue Sea, the film pushes all the right buttons in all the right places. There is very little original with this film, but each actor does play their parts well. The only real gripe I have, is that when it starts hitting the fan, these highly trained FBI profiler wannabees panic. They seem to forget all that they've learnt making the solution to their problems that much harder. Oh and Johnny Lee Millers accent. Although the \"serial killer\" idea has been done to death, if you'll excuse the pun, there are some clever moments. The domino scene was a nice surprise. Well executed, but just like in Deep Blue Sea, a major player gets bumped off fairly early. I found this a good pizza Sat evening with your buddies kind of movie. Like I said. Formulaic, but fun Worth seeing.....; This is an excellent film; however, do not expect to see the two main characters in the film long. The films more famous actors Val Kilmer (Jake Harris) and Christian Slater (J.D. Reston) are only present in the film approximately fifteen minutes. As a matter of fact, J.D. Reston character's departure is so abrupt it's almost unbelievable. The premise of the film involves a class of seven top FBI agents all vying for FBI \"Profiler\" positions, and a government investigator researching the \"Profiler\" training regiment. The final exam is set on some deserted Navy Seal training island in the middle of no where. While on the island, the agents are to investigate a crime scene, and work up the murder's profile before the weekend's end. However, a real murderer is on the island. The agents become the prey in an elaborate game of cat-and-mouse. As time continues to slip away, the agents are forced to solve complicated puzzles in an attempt to foil the killer's next planned assassination. Whose the killer and who will survive this diabolical scheme is anyone's guess. This is by far my favorite genre of film. The plot sequences are new and inventive; the highly sophisticated nuances just heighten the enjoyment of the film. The entertainment factor is off the scale, I highly recommend this film. My suggestion: Worth the Full Price of Admission; however, it will be available on DVD shortly http://farisreel.com The hunt for a mind...; ...but an unsuccessful one. So what you get is a mindless story with mindless characters and a predictable ending. The story centers around a group of soon to be FBI profilers. To graduate they are flown to a lonely island that belongs to the Navy. They're instructed that a murder will be set up, which they will have to solve successfully. So far so good, but that's as good as it gets. While the idea for this story is pretty promising, the script behind the movie itself is not. Once the group finds the fake murder scene they realize that this was just a set up to ambush them directly. Now, they encounter a series of traps that are set up to kill them all off. The actors do an OK job portraying unbelievable characters and unbelievable they are. Once the action starts, everybody is on the edge like any other victim in any horror movie. However, we're not dealing with unsuspecting victims, but with professionals, who are everything but unsuspecting. And this is just one point where the script loses touch with reality. They soon suspect that the killer is one of them, which in the end proves to be true, but how does that make sense? They were together all the time, yet setting up the traps would have taken a considerable amount of time. Also, the distrust and hate among the group doesn't make much sense either. You'd expect that such a small group of people who has been through the hard school of the FBI would bond pretty much. In fact, team play is one of the qualities that the FBI seeks, yet this movie portrays a group of loners. The fact that the traps are all pretty random and would have been easily avoidable also doesn't get into the way of the movie. Same goes for the fact that they all seem to be nerdy lab rats. At one point they analyze blood and other samples, where you'd have to ask yourself: How come they know how to do that? If you're a profiler, this is not your job. That's what you have labs for. Why are they suddenly experts on biochemistry? How did all the analysis equipment get to the Navy database? Why aren't they earning a fortune by working at pharmaceutical companies, or any other company that pays well for those qualities? How could mentally unstable personalities get as far in the FBI school as they could? These are just a few of the many plot holes. The most annoying one must be the one that they blame themselves for the murders, even though their instructor explicitly said that an extra person would be the puppet master of the murder, yet no one gets the idea that this unknown guy might be responsible. The movie also features terrible one liners, for example \"where there's a skill, there's a weakness\". How does that make sense?? By that logic an unskilled person would have no weaknesses at all. Still, the movie is able to get even worse. In one of the last scenes, the three remaining guys run around the base, shooting dummy targets that pop up from the ground in the hope to kill the puppet master. Well, that a human being just doesn't pop up from the ground in a stiff fashion should be enough not to waste ammo on something like that, yet they all fire away like the brain dead meat puppets they are. This scene only serves the purpose to get rid of the ammo, so that the movie can bore you for 5 more minutes with a ridiculous fight, instead of a quick stand off. All in all, this wouldn't have been half bad if the script wouldn't have abandoned reality just to make its ridiculous storyline and characters work. After all, that's how you distinguish good movies from bad ones. It's not the over the top plot, or exalted characters that make a good movie, but a storyline that is believable enough to have happened in reality. Watch a Grisham movie to see a perfect example for that matter. Anyway, this is worth a rent, but certainly not a buy. deaths too absurd, plot too silly; I don't think this was a very good movie. I like movies about serial killers, but the plot to this one was very silly. And from the first death,J.D., I thought this is going to be bad. J.D. is killed by being sprayed with Nitrogen, which freezes him and he breaks into pieces. That must be the silliest death ever in a movie. I just don't think something like that would be plausible. One guy is found dead after the group wakes up from being drugged. His body looked so fake, just like a mannequin even before the head fell off. The one guy that was a little interesting, Jake Harris, is gone after the first part of the film. And then of course, when we find out who the killer was, it's silly. And Sara Moore is not well written if she was supposed to be the female heroine. FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it. Just an overall bad plot. this movie Rocked!!! , why straight to DVD ?; this film rocked it has 4 big movie actors in it and kathrinne morris (from the hit show cold case). unlike many other serial killer whodunnits this one keeps you guessing right up till the very end and it wasn't afraid to kill-off a major star or 2 to throw you from the usual \"murder she wrote\" style casting. it's slick filming , gripping storyline and clever direction makes me wonder why this didn't go to theaters. one of the finest elements of mindhunters was the way the momentum is thrust forward by the serial killer leaving clues (in the form of broken watches) to indicate when someone will die next, this gives us the opportunity to see the various characters go deeper into fear and paranoia trying to beat the clock to solve how the next person will die and more importantly who that person will be. renny harlin has made some good films in the past and this to me,is one of his best. Crime Thriller Turned Horror Turned Bad; The premise of this crime thriller of FBI profilers being out profiled was a nice idea but the main thrust of this movie turned the more intriguing, intellectual, thriller like \"Manhunter\" or televisions CSI into more of a horror movie with all the mindless trappings of gore from in the more blood and guts teen movies. The set up rapidly descended into stupidity with the profilers seemingly at a loss only to pick later in the movie but too late. The script attempts a double and even triple twist but with interesting but not completely satisfactory results. Unfortunately, this movie's genre was mixed up and the blend of crime thriller and horror thriller made the movie much more bland. From a horror standpoint, a number of the bloody ideas were of some interest and with more sensitivity this movie could have been much better. Nevertheless, the movie managed to salvage some interest, curiosity, doubt but the twists were more confusing and desperate, the martial art scene pretty feeble. In sum, Mindhunters was a nice attempt, commendable efforts by Christian Slater and Val Kilmer whose talents weren't not given sufficient use (especially considering Kilmer's excellent performance in Spartan that came out the same year). An OK movie but could have been a lot better. Six out of Ten Stars. pretty cool; yah, this movie is pretty cool, don't know why its getting trashed so much. it does seem to try too hard to have ll cool j try to throw in some nice \"hip\" lines, and the dialog is mediocre, but i mean besides that the movie is pretty cool. i'm not spoiling anything by saying people are getting killed in this movie, and the way that they get killed is pretty original. taking into consideration the director also directed deep blue sea... just watching it really reminds me of deep blue sea, the plots are different, but the way the movie was created, its extremely similar, so if you liked deep blue sea, you're sure to like this movie. Ridiculous premise...mediocre script...extremely bad casting; This one I had high hopes for, man what a waste of time. My reasoning to watch this was Renny Harlin. He always seems to pick em pretty well. I can't believe he chose to do this . He musta owed someone in the biz a favor. The one spoiler I will mention doesn't actually implicate the actual killer but I thought I'd bring it up for those who like to go back in time and re-think this one. How in the world did he get the time to rig up all these little contraptions in the few hours he was on that island? It's not possible. Totally laughable. With the exception of the night they arrived and slept, when? They're there 2 days and through out this film..they don't sleep and they're in each others company almost the whole time. There's also know way he could have visited the island ahead of time because no-1 knew where they were going until the lead instructor told them the day before. Explain that to me. The premise itself is just stupid cause here in America, we just have that many genius psychos who join the FBI to kill for fun. Just ridiculous. I won't go into detail about the crappy casting but if you can look through the cast here above this review, you'll know what I mean. Still one of my favorite films!; First of all, let me start by saying I've seen this move probably more then 20 times by know. Somehow the story never gets old! Starting with a group of wanna be FBI profilers and their mentor setting out for a deserted island to profile a fictive killer and to earn their stripes as a profiler. Of course the whole thing goes terrible wrong (which is all I'm going to say about that) and the story unfolds from there. There is something about this group of actors and the way they interact with each other that feels so natural, you don't question it. The pace of the movie is very good, with suspense in all the right places. So to summarize: very, very good cast, good acting, nice pace of the movie and a bit (a little bit) of a surprise ending. Definitely a must-see!! A thrilling entertainer...; Mindhunters, a thriller/mystery/action movie, somewhat similar to 2002's D-Tox (or Eye See You), tells the story of a bunch of FBI profilers stuck on an island during an exercise, getting killed one after the other. The film starts off well enough, if a bit predictably, with a sequence that puts you in the mood and gets you interested and intrigued. From then on, director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger,...) keeps a good pace and never lets the viewer get bored. And despite the arguably weak ending, most of the movie's events are unexpected and thrilling. The actors do a pretty good job (othing spectacular, but the script doesn't call for it). A few \"name\" actors are present (Val Kilmer, Christian Slater, LL Cool J), however, like in Renny Harlin's own, and also somewhat similar movie Deep Blue Sea (also with LL Cool J), that doesn't really mean much (I can't go into more detail without revealing spoilers). All-in-all, Mindhunters, scripted by the up-and-coming Wayne Kramer with ghost rewrites from the already-up-there Ehren Kruger, is a solid entertainer which fulfills its promise. And while it's true it could easily have been better, it isn't, and what it is already quite good. Mindhunters; Okay, so I have an affinity for Renny Harlin's Hollywood movies. So sue me, I can't help but enjoy these polished time-wasters. I'm also a sucker for these FBI crime thrillers where someone is not who they seem. On an island compound, designed by the FBI to train profilers, Kilmer places a group of intelligent wannabees there to find a \"killer\" called the \"Puppeteer\". It's all supposed to be a simulated game..this changes when murders start to occur. Lots of tricks and traps are pulled by the puppeteer, and the film goes out of it's way to place LL Cool J(charismatic as always)as the chief suspect. Sure, the film will also put out there the main heroine as well, but this is perhaps far-fetched that anyone would believe she's anything more than a decoy by the screenplay to leave open everyone as suspect. Yes, I was eye-rolling at some of the elaborately staged death traps, but they are built much like SAW in surprising us. You never know what crazy kill will happen next and to whom. And, the always asked question..who is the exceptionally talented assassin? This, like SAW before it, is the ultimate screenwriter movie. I can envision the writer coming up with all kinds of nutty scenarios at his laptop, hammering out which ones work best. I felt the revealing of the killer and his motivations rubbish. I question the ability of anyone being able to set up and execute such sharply created death tricks. But, the film is a play of cat and mouse with the viewer. I will freely admit to being entertained, nothing more or less than that. Nothing new but entertaining; To be honest, I wasn't expecting much when I sat down to watch Mindhunters, but I found myself pleasantly surprised. Is the film perfect? No, the basic idea has been done to death and there are some scenes that don't hold much surprise, while some of the dialogue and characterisation is on the clichéd side and there are two performances that didn't quite work, LL Cool J, who is better as a rapper than as an actor here he tries to be too cool and comes across as annoying, and Patricia Velasquez, whose performance is sexy but very laboured. That said, Val Kilmer's character is the most interesting and he is quite charismatic in the time he has, Kathryn Morris is tolerable, Christian Slater is okay and Johnny Lee Miller is reliably good as he always is. The story while basically not the most original film on the planet, is tense, mysterious and atmospheric, the dialogue that is not clichéd is entertaining, the film is decently paced and moves at a cracking pace, the solution is interesting and plausible and the photography, editing and lighting add very well to the atmosphere. In conclusion, I liked it, despite it not being more than it could've been. 7/10 Bethany Cox Eeny, meeny, miney, mo. Who's the next motherf***er to go?; This movie was a good surprise, since I was actually expecting a below average flick. The film doesn't really offer anything really new but it sure was entertaining, even if a lot of it was implausible, downright ridiculous and mindless at times like some critics seem to claim. The government send these so called brightest discoverers on a island for a simulation program to solve clues and prove how good they really are and enhance there skills. But it turns out a serial killer is among them that goes by the name of the puppeteer and is trying to take them down one at a time. This was tight and suspenseful thriller. But I found some scenarios to get a bit annoying, like when they make judgment calls on other people from just there observations at a glance and showing off who is more aware of one another was sort of entertaining but you lose respect for the character cause the way they go about it. And makes the profiler wannabes or FBI students seem like egotistic moron, plus they get a lot of there assumptions wrong. Which applies to the real world, but I started to not care as much for some of the characters. The premise seemed like some sort of reality game show, except this is actually a lot of fun to watch, especially cause the annoying contestants die. The bickering and argument got a bit tedious as well since the person they suspect just about always ends up dying, proving the person accused is not the killer. And even when they argue they don't even try to listen to the other person's side of the story, which made all of them look unprofessional, plus they started losing there cool which leads them to make bad decisions. In fact a lot of the decisions some of the characters make in this movie is illogical at times, maybe it's the lack of character development or something but it just didn't make any sense. The most annoying character has to be Nicole Willis(Patricia Velasquez) and you start to wonder why she was chosen as one of the elites, cause she is just that idiotic and a huge hypocrite, plus nothing about her is attractive and her accent got irritating after a while. I liked how when the clues seems to have led to a conclusion, it ain't over and leads to something more, which was a pretty cool touch to the film. And I guess all the actors did what they were suppose to do, but Val Kilmer stood out the most. As a matter of fact he would have played Albert Wesker in the \"Resident Evil\" movies quite well. The one liners were very cheesy, but somewhat amusing like the rest of the film. I really liked the atmosphere of how anyone could die and how the killer uses each victims weaknesses against them. This is a fast paced thrill ride, that I had a good time with. So definitely worth checking out, even if it's for just one viewing. 7.6/10</td>\n",

       "      <td>I liked it!; I have to say that this film was simpa. Plot is set in a hospital in Paris and shows all the horrors which doctors and patients have to live thru. Acting is very good and main characters show truly how life of a doctor in the hospital in France can be hard and complicated. It also shows well suffering of the patients and what their families have to live thru when mistakes are made by the doctors. If you are a fan of the European cinematography and want to see how life in every day France looks like I recommend that you see this film. Otherwise you will not miss too much by not watching it. Hospital Corners; If it's tough being a cowboy in Rochdale it's not that much easier being an intern in a French hospital, a sentiment which pretty much comprises the message of Hippocrate. Vincent Lacoste - and no, he doesn't sport crocodile shoes - is one such intern and we join him on his first day at a hospital where his father, Jacques Gamblin, is head honcho. Gamblin in fact is the only 'name' in the cast and certainly the only name that may be recognisable to audiences outside France so it is ironic that his total screen time amounts to something like twenty minutes every one of which he could have phoned in. Within what appear to be minutes of his arrival Lacoste decides a patient would require an ECG only to be told that the relevant equipment is broken and has been for months. Inevitably the patient dies and Lacoste is encouraged by colleagues not least his own father, to state that an ECG was performed and showed negative and again inevitably this returns to haunt him. He befriends an Algerian intern, a full doctor in his own country, who is also tailor-made for the scapegoat role when one is needed. This, in general, is the tone of a fine if mostly unremarkable film. French Doctor In the House  nearly; Benjamin (Vincent Lacoste) has just started at the Paris hospital where his papa works and he is convinced he is going to be a model doctor. However; he soon finds out that theory is often easier than practice. He also encounters an Algerian doctor Abdel (Reda Kateb  'A Prophet') who is among the legions of foreign doctors who have to doubly prove themselves in the French medical system. They get up to the usual shenanigans and also like to party  but the realities of cutbacks and a hospital administrator poached from Amazon (!) starts to make doing their job too difficult. Now this is supposed to be a comedy  and it was amusing in places but far from being actually laugh out loud. The acting is all fine, and the stories were very good too  I like the fact they all watch 'House'. However this is just a nice film and not one that is going to rock your world  that said I still enjoyed it. If you are a Francophile or like a medical drama then I am sure you will appreciate this Gallic offering. A superb drama; I like this movie speaking of the hard daily burden of doctors in a big hospital. A poignant drama with tremendous performances. Reda Kaleb is here outstanding, as a Young Algerian doctor who fights like a dog to apply his own rules. Like this one to help a near death old woman not to suffer anymore. See what I mean? It is not a indictment for euthanasia, as was for instance MILLION DOLLAR BABY, but only a gripping story, sometimes very hard to Watch. His character is awesome. A true hero, who doesn't hesitate to sacrifice himself for his ideas. Only the last two minutes are a bit run of the mill. But for the rest, don't hesitate. A realistic approach to medicine; Hiporcrates is a French film that revolves around a young intern, Benjamin and his discovery of life as a doctor, as he begins to recognize negligence and pain in his own surroundings. The relationships among the characters are often tender, but never stop being conscious and logical. With a realistic and low-key dialogue (and very subtle humour), beautifully constructed and believable characters, Hipocrates manages brake with the godly-like portrayal of doctors to make a smart film that acknowledges an often neglected and ignored issue as the medical situation and the treatment of human pain.</td>\n",

       "11765  Full Refund Please; In a SNL skit, an audience member tells Charlie Sheen that he took a date to see \"Men at Work\" and bought popcorn and soda and such. Charlie Sheen then hands him $30 and apologizes. That's what my wife and I thought after we saw this movie. The concept of common sense evaded people who are characterized by having it in abundance. I seriously doubt FBI agents make the same stupid mistakes or have the same idiotic hang-ups that the agents had in this movie. There could have been more on the technical side of profiling and less on the lameness of the plot. It got to the point where the agents were doing things that even my wife admitted she wouldn't be stupid enough to do. If I ever meet Val Kilmer or Christian Slater, I'm going to tell them I saw this movie. Hopefully they will understand that it's 100 minutes of my life I'll never get back, and will at least give me $40 to make up for the money I spent. Fluff-Stuff; Formulaic thrill ride with intellectual pretensions as F.B.I. profilers are at the center. The best and the brightest. Ooops! That is the problem in this visually vigorous \"guess the killer among us\" Movie. The Agents don't seem to be too smart although they pretend to be, spin and solve a Rubik's Cube in less than two minutes, is an obvious and ostentatious display. If you buy these characters and settle in for the somewhat creative and sanguinary serial killings, the Movie might pass as an entertaining diversion. The set-ups and the executions are the main thing here and complexity or the mysterious are shelved. An acceptable entry into the middle rungs of this kind of thing that has more style than substance. The ending is ho-hum and goes on a bit too long, but in the end it is watchable but frivolous fluff-stuff. Not A lot of thought went into Mindhunters; When Christian Slater is on the marquee of the movie you're about to see, you can pretty much expect a couple things. The first one is that Slater most likely will die within the first reel and the other one is that the movie will probably suck. \"Mindhunters\" doesn't disappoint on either level. This is not a spoiler, this is fact. Val Kilmer, another fallen star, is a sadistic trainer for a group of would be FBI profilers. The group is on the verge of advancing in the program but as a final test, Kilmer brings them to a secluded island to test their skills. The problem is that a killer is offing each profiler one by one and the agents all suspect each other. They all become paranoid and there is a lot of gun pointing. This movie has some entertaining moments and I give it some props for coming up with such interesting ways of impalement and death. But for the most part, this movie is pretty stupid. The motivation behind all the violence is really pretty weak and I knew exactly when the little twist comes in to play. \"Mindhunters\" is decent popcorn fare, but it's really a waste of time. (**) A very insightful film--even better from an intellectual viewpoint; The lady doth protest too much... I personally thought this was a good film, with a lot of interesting sub-texts. No film is perfect, so I was hardly expecting it to be a \"Usual Suspects\" calibre-film, or \"American Beauty\" (to name but two of my favourite all-time ones), but it was excellent for giving food for thought. The idea about people exposing their weaknesses and their strengths and how that can be used against them was scary. I took one cue from this movie--and that was, perhaps naively, it's not always too good to show too much of what type of person you are. Not that there are serial killers lurking round every corner, but I think the film is a metaphor for how our weaknesses, strengths, and whatnot of our characters can make or mar us. Clichéd perhaps, but a useful reminder not to reveal yourself too much as there are dark and dangerous minds out there. What I disliked, though, was some of the dialogue being too predictable--serial killers are supposed to have been bed-wetters; thankfully, there was none of that in there, but the reference to parents gave the game away. On a positive note, I liked LL Cool J's acting. I though it was solid and robust. He delivered his lines with tremendous ease, and made his \"gate-crashing\" very well-intervened. To add to the above, I think there's an existential element about this yarn that I don't have sufficient knowledge to elaborate on---but I would recommend for those that disliked the film for the story-line, try watching it again, paying close attention to how the killer was able to kill everyone off. Note the ideas about \"misdirection\" and people's habits...and it can potentially send a shiver down the spine at worst, and at best, give fantastic food for thought for next time when you're at a party with people you don't know, how you don't tell them \"I don't go anywhere without my gun\":-) I give it an 8/10 excellent; this is a really good movie i would recommend it to anyone who likes a thriller and a mystery. its keeps you on your feet. watch it if you have the chance. if like mysteries than you will like this one. the reason why i rated it 9 out of 10 because it was nail bitting and it had many new plots you never knew who was the killer. anyways watch it. if you haven't then go to the movie store and buy it, don't rent it cause you will waste the 5 bucks. its that good that you don't want to rent it you want to buy it. i don't have anything else to say because i'm not supposed to give it away. its a good movie just go and see it gosh go and see it Awful; Warning - Spoilers ahead I was really mad that Val Kilmer had to die in this movie.  This movie would have been good if Val Kilmer would have survived.  I do however liked LL Cool J's role.  This movie was really freaky.  It shows you that a killer gets those that have a liking for certain things. \"CSI\" meets Agatha Christie meets \"Copycat\"... and not in a good way; >>SPOILERS AHEAD<< The story borrows something from every feature listed above, but the plot is mostly Agatha Cristie's \"10 Little Indians\". The killer is among the isolated group of victims and, as in every Christie's story, you spend the whole time guessing the proverbial \"who did it\". Of course everybody has some kind of motive and is, therefore, a possible suspect, until his own death clears him of the suspicion. Unfortunately this formula has already been heavily exploited in the past (even by Christie herself), so it gets pretty tiresome once the stage is set up. You watch characters getting killed off one after another in a series of contrived (and pretty unbelievable) ambushes they keep falling into (and to think they are meant to be intelligent above average - crime investigators). You wonder who the killer is but numerous twists and turns keep you (and the characters) from pinpointing someone particular. In the aftermath it's no wonder that the killer is NEVER who you thought would be. No, the killer is the one who gets killed off earlier but is never checked for pulse (literally). And it is always kind of a let down. Of course the final battle between the killer and the last victim never goes without the villain explaining why he did what he did (for the audience). As if it mattered. So once you take the plot for what it really is - a vehicle for an action thriller - you get a solid action movie, but without much thrills. Blood and gore is there, but one has seen worse. Fight scenes are well executed but there is always something funny about them, in a slapstick sort of way. And the final showdown with gunfire under water is hilarious! Harlin is a decent action director, but is evidently lacking in building suspense and making us care for the characters. The minute he kills off the only character you could potentially like (Slater), we are left with a group of hysterical and slow-witted people you just can't wait to see disposed (that goes particularly for that Indian girl who is plainly overacting). If you want real psycho-drama-thriller watch \"Copycat\". If you care for modern-style blood and gore watch CSI on TV. And if you want to see Harlin's only real masterpiece watch \"A Long Kiss Goodnight\". An all around good thriller; This is probably the best FBi thriller made ever. The acting is great and it keeps you guessing the whole film (I am mad at the discussion board users because they gave away who the killer is and i haven't watched it all yet) but its still fantastic. It has the best murder sequences since Freddy Krueger hit Elm street, i loved how well the characters were developed and how well they were murdered. I saw about 55 minutes of it and three people were killed off (If you a guy who watches these movies for the murders) and each time the killer is not shown, he just sets traps for them. The film was great and the acting terrific, where are the Oscars on this one? It stinks (possible spoilers); I personally think Renny Harlen is one of the most underrated directors working in Hollywood--he has more talent in his little finger than an an Antoine Fuqua or Gore Verbinski, both of whom have managed to direct action movies without having the slightest idea how to actually stage exciting action scenes.  I mean as bad as Cutthroat Island was, it had far more impressive action sequences than anything in Pirates of the Carribbean.  Unfortunately it didn't have much of anything else and that's the problem with Harlen--he's a truly gifted filmmaker who has no talent whatsoever when it comes to choosing his scripts. This one ranks alongside Driven as being Harlen's worst to date.  The premise is promising, although it bares more than a passing resemblance to the derided (but better) Stallone vehicle Detox. People who go to movies looking for Friday the 13th style colorful kills will probably enjoy this.  The problem for me was that the murders were so outlandish they not only seemed completely impossible--they actually crossed the line into goofy self-parody.  This movie generates little suspense, the script (by the writer/director of The Cooler) doesn't make much sense, the biggest stars are killed off or disappear from the movie early.  Pretty much everything that can be wrong with this movie is. The studio should just dump this garbage on cable where it belongs--a theatrical release would be a waste of time and money, although the film could pick up a cult following among drunken frat boys who will no doubt enjoy the goofy murders. Correction On Previous Comment:; I have made an egregious error.  Renny Harlin did not direct STRIKING DISTANCE, although he is responsible for DEEP BLUE SEA and that Andrew \"Dice\" Clay vehicle THE ADVENTURES OF FORD FAIRLANE.  The man truly responsible is Rowdy Herrington.  Herrington has helmed such classics as GLADIATOR (the one with Brian Dennehy, 1992) and the mullet showcase that was ROAD HOUSE.  I offer my heartfelt apologies to anyone who this mistake has offended or confused, and to the family, friends and representation of Mr. Harlin.  They are both bad directors but by far Herrington is the lesser film maker.  Thank You.... Mindless; Jake Harris (Val Kilmer) runs a training program for FBI profilers. It's above and beyond the normal gun training. He takes the team to Oniega Island off the coast of North Carolina to take part in a simulation. Philadelphia P.D. detective Gabe Jensen (LL Cool J) tag along to observe. They are assigned a serial killer called the Puppeteer. However the killings soon become real. It's an Agatha Christie murder mystery crossed with the modern trend of serial killer and FBI profilers. The problem is that it's so completely fake. I'm not saying murder mysteries are always about realism. There is something over the top ridiculous about this that drains the brains out of this thriller. I'm not invested in guessing who is the real killer. It becomes how crazy each perfectly timed kill gets. That has a bit of value but not that much. The director that critics love to hate; Let's face it, along with Tony Scott, Renny Harlin is probably the critics least favorite major filmmaker, and I must admit the guy has made a couple of real clunkers (Cutthroat Island was deservedly trashed), but this is the second of his critically lambasted films that I truly enjoyed. \"Deep Blue Sea\" is the other. Yeah, the plot holes in \"Mindhunters\" were colossal, but man I was thoroughly entertained for 100 or so minutes. To even start to describe the plot it sounds ridiculous, but I am surprised this movie did not do better at the box office. In a word this film was fun, gross, but fun. OK that's two words. And there is something that happened in this film that may be the new Harlin signature. Here comes a minor spoiler...... So stop reading if you plan to rent the DVD..... Just like in \"Deep Blue Sea\" the films major star is killed off first. Also in a similar way.... That is with a very gross demise. Wonder if this is a future trend in his movies. By the way the major director that I love to hate is Stephen Sommers. How does that guy ever get a job? Watch it as a comedy and not a thriller, much better; This movie is about a bunch of FBI wannabe profilers who get dumped on an island and left to solve a simulated case when they start getting bumped off for real. From the very first killing to the last these FBI wannabes are utterly clueless and incompetent. It's like watching Police Academy: The horror years or something. Some of the methods for killing off the agents are more inventive than in saw and, of course, just as likely to totally fail because they are over engineered. In fact, treating it as a comedy made for a better movie than treating it as a serious thriller. Not even worth watching for the famous actors...; *SPOILERS* ...because they die in the first eighth of the movie. What makes this so bad is not that they are the most respected actors in the film, it's the fact that they seemed to be the main focus at the start of the movie. The film never seemed to get the slightest character development from any of the other characters, and the editing was horrible. The movie didn't run smoothly. It felt like a TV movie, because it kept jumping from one scene to the other. First of all, they're accusing this guy, then they're accusing this guy, and this guy...your head may go dizzy keeping up with the film. The death scenes are also outrageously hilarious. I felt like I was watching a serious version of Airplane! The film is also very fast paced, and by fast paced, I mean faster than the damn Flash. There is a lot of death scenes in the movie that try to be emotional, but they aren't because we get zero character development to make us pity them. In fact, you kind of wanted the characters that didn't die to die. There was also a pointless scene at the start of the movie that was obviously trying to hook us...then it turned out to just be a police training sequence. So, they decide to go training on a desert island. Don't worry, the film gets worse as it goes along. In fact, the only good thing I can remember about this movie is the quotes in the film, which were quite funny, especially the \"eeny meany miny moe who's the next mother to go\" quote. But apart from that, this film was utter crap, and I can't believe some people find this underrated. I was expecting a lower score than 6.4/10 for this pile of stink. Don't worry, there's also a lot of cliché helicopter flying scenes, which were popular in the early 2000's. Overall, I guess you can watch it to have a laugh, but if you're looking for a serious, gripping mystery with GOOD plot twists, stay away from this. 1.9/10! The movie was great,and the plot was pretty good...; I've been reading comments where people say some situations are over the top and that they act silly and do stuff that are hard to believe.Well,seeing as they are professional profilers and must have great minds,what did you expect?'course the hole plot was a bit dramatic but hey,the dude is crazy and brilliant,what did you expect?It's a fantastic movie and I fail to see why people are so into putting down great movies...I bet some saw it twice just to find something wrong...then again,I agree some actors could be different but the hole team fits perfectly,so why the hell complain?In my opinion the best part was when they all fall asleep because of the coffee and when Sara changes the time to stay 15 minutes behind.Really clever.And Nic's death was the most well thought in my opinion....great job,indeed. Good, fun movie; I think this was a terrific script which could have been an amazing film - but for  some major cheese spread throughout.  BUT it still is a very exciting film with  generally decent acting. It is full of good twists and generally keeps attention.  Far, far better than I expected with some amazing moments. Derivative and has a few plot holes but exciting enough to make up for it; This was a movie I enjoyed a lot. If you're looking for originality this isn't the movie for you but it takes a tried and true movie formula and pulls it off well.There is a very clever satire of Silence of the Lambs at the beginning which is funny but the main plot is a bunch of would-be profilers go on a field-training exercise on a remote island. Well you know the rest. Suddenly things become very real when they start dying one by one. Since there is no one else on the island which is used for \"war games\" and FBI training, the killer has to be one of THEM. Can they \"profile\" the killer and catch him or her before they're all dead? Well of course paranoia sets in and the devilishly clever killer is able to exploit each victim's individual weaknesses. There are lots of plot twists of course but I found the identity of the killer rather easy to guess if you were paying attention and \"profiling\" throughout the movie. Certainly you'd think real profilers-in-training would have been able to figure it out. But the plot is still very exciting with all it's twists and turns and LL Cool J does an especially good job playing a cop who is \"observing\" the exercise and not an FBI agent and thus becomes the natural \"outsider\" in the group. In the end, if you just take the movie for what it is, a basic and rather unoriginal thriller, which is never the less exciting and in some ways well-crafted, you won't be disappointed. It delivers all or most of what this type of movie should and is a lot better than many I've seen. 8/10 Serial killing For Dummies . . . By Dummies; What is it about this concept that has now created two of the worst thrillers in recent history? (The first being the Sly Stallone atrocity \"Eye See You\", ironically seen by very few). In all honesty, I think the idea -- A group of law enforcement types trapped in a confined area, then stalked and slaughtered by a serial killer -- has potential for a really cool flick . . . This sure as hell ain't it. The so-called Feds here never seem to have come across a dead body in their lives (The female lead is not only nauseated by real corpses but bloodied dummies as well), let alone trained as profilers. The writers, meanwhile, seem to have never met a cliché they didn't like. Toss into this 'sh** stew' director Renny Harlin (who once upon a time actually had talent) inventing up increasingly ridiculous camera angles (Stay tuned for the clock's POV!)every two minutes or so, a kinetic fight sequence out of a (bad) Jet Li flick and some of the silliest (not to mention contrived) murders on celluloid and you have . . . this. The most scariest thing about this movie is that the finale -- Featuring a laughable underwater face-off --was apparently the best of five allegedly filmed endings. Now that truly boggles the mind. Good Suspense; Saw this on cable and I must say it is pretty darn good. The traps set by the antagonist was gruesome and elaborate. The suspense was built up at a good pace, however, the finale and the uncovering of the killer should have been tweaked a bit. I enjoyed Patricia Valasquez as she is one of the fine-looking Hispanic actresses out there and she kept her accent which is a plus when Hollywood insists foreign actors speak with an American accent. I am glad no sequel was made to the best of my knowledge. It would have been pretty watered down and would not live up to the original. The idea of using FBI profilers is a good idea and the settings on a deserted island is also well done. I recommend this good thriller. Terrible; Okay, lets get right down to business. The plot is about some FBI trainees who are close to graduation under the eccentric tutelage of Val Kilmer. For their final test they are transported to a training island where they will find a murder scene and have to come up with a profile for the killer. Now maybe I'm not as aware as I think I am but the FBI does not train like this...they do not take a random group of people to a classified training island to come up with a profile, but that's besides the point. But let's keep going. In this group you've got just about everybody represented...white, hispanic, black, handicapped... Over a weekend, they are supposed to find the crime scene and come up with the killer's profile. But when they find the crime scene, gasp, one of the group is killed in an impossibly intricate set-up. These will only get worse as the film goes on, however. As the group comes under stress, each character reacts in a different way as expected and of course you're subject to the usual \"who did it\" dramas which end up taking up half of the remaining movie as of course, one by one, characters get killed off in an impossibly intricate ways as the group set about trying to get the killer's profile. So eventually, everybody dies except for the people you expect to make it to the last scene and then of course they fight and get into a shootout over the mock-up town. Then there is a predictable \"twist\" which is followed by a silly underwater gun fight... Movies like these try to be so clever and more often than not, they fail. Some of the acting is pretty bad and it has all the tired old plot lines for some of the characters and in reality, the real killer would never have had enough time to do everything he does in the film. For instance, when he is confessing himself to one of the last remaining characters, he says he used the time when the team was drugged by the coffee to set everything up. Well, okay...one of the things he did was use blood to write numbers on some windows...except there were hundreds if not thousands of numbers in a precise order...this alone would have taken hours. Furthermore, most of his traps would have required precise timing and exact measurements to pull off and with equipment that he could not have known would be available to him upon arriving on this island. If you're looking for something to pass the time and you see this movie on some movie channel, give it a shot but don't expect much. But this sad rip-off of \"Ten Little Indians\" just doesn't pull it off...way too many plot holes. The most disappointing movie I have ever seen in my life; I remember sitting in \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" for the first time, waiting for the movie to start, watching the previews. There was this cool-looking trailer for a mystery/thriller in the vein of And Then There Were None . . . Mindhunters! I looked it up, and it looked pretty freakin' sweet. And then it was pushed back. A LOT. The anticipation built. And then, when it finally came out, I was the first in line to go see it. And what a disappointment. 18 months of looking forward to a movie and I get THIS? The characters are lame, flat, and boring. They don't propel the story, and they all seem like they're made out of cardboard. Not a single one of them is sympathetic. The main character was kinda developed during one or two scenes, but there were far too many scenes of nothing but explaining what's going on, and the typical: \"What are we going to do?\" \"I don't know.\" \"We need to find the killer.\" Blah blah blah. Keanu Reeves and Plank from Ed, Edd, and Eddy could've made these characters more interesting. Even worse, the deaths weren't thrilling in the least. There's one scene in which a character has his legs frozen by liquid nitrogen. He falls over, they shatter, and he's dead. Woo hoo! Only the scene wasn't thrilling due to horrible special effects and even worse acting from all of the leads. The only thing we got out of that character was a steamy scene earlier in the film . . . I didn't feel bad for him. And the ending is just horrible. It's not that it's predictable, it's that it makes no sense whatsoever. Apparently the killer can teleport and rig up crazy booby traps in the blink of an eye, because they (I say \"they\" so you don't know whether the killer is male or female, as if you wouldn't be able to tell) was able to do that while everybody's backs were turned. And then there's a horrible red herring where one character is set up as the killer. That character is chasing the other characters and shooting at them, and then . . . whaaaaa? You mean that's NOT the killer! WTF! Just avoid this movie, unless you're looking to see some slick camera work. That's what got this movie a three in my book, because the acting was terrible and the script was worse. But I'm willing to admit that it wouldn't have been as horrible if they had just released it when it was supposed to have been released. If you're into this kind of films,and enjoy enjoying films,you'll love this one.; As the previous comment said, it certainly serves its purpose. Mindhunters is one of these movies that show you that some people still making movies for what they are meant to do : entertain you! From what I've been reading quite often in imdb people tend to forget this. Anyway, down to business now. What I liked in Mindhunters was its speed. Never let you go. Right from the beginning, very nice opening imho, has your fullest attention. And when they go on the island, its party time! The plot gets even more interesting, you got questions popped up in your head as it goes and suddenly you get to be the profiler. You just cant stop guessing. The whole island set was terrific. Gives out this isolation feeling, being an isolated island of course, but at the same time it gets pretty spooky I think. Especially at night. I found its music to be very, very good. It starts with a very low and lyrical rythme, and as the story unfolds its gets more upbeat. The direction was just the right one. Not too much or too less of it. It had the right shots when they were needed, some fast ones were great, the acting was pretty decent, the script... Now as far as the script is concerned, it did have some plotholes. I don't know, maybe I didn't get some scenes, but I have the feeling that something went a bit wrong there. But that's definitely not going to ruin the feeling of the movie. This is a great movie for people who can enjoy films for what they are. If any of you has heard negative words, forget it, and just sit your butt down and watch it. If you're into this kind of films, and you really enjoy enjoying films, you gonna love this one. I'd give it a 8.5 out of 10 Good Movie; MindHunters is the best movie I've seen in a long time. This movie is was what a lot of movies should be keep you guessing through the whole film very good acting throughout the film I hope people do not dismiss this movie because it's really good and actually worth going to the movies and spending dollars to see. I really stopped going to the movies because I was tired of movies being hyped but when you see it you're really disappointed but this movie was really a surprise. SEE IT!!! Everyone has there own opinion that's true. Anyway this movie is good/not perfect but I feel when you watch a movie you want to be entertained and I feel that this movie did that. What you see is what you get...; It's the type of thriller that delivers just about what you should expect from uhm... this type of thriller and it isn't half bad. What makes it fun is some effective death scenes and at least one good surprise early in the movie (when the first of the team is killed off on the island). A lot of the plot film-buffs will see coming a mile away but it makes for a fun 90 minutes none the less. The cast is nice, the thrills are what you'd expect but still fun and that final duel is surprisingly brilliant. That's one time where I actually wouldn't mind keeping my head underwater. I would rate it 7 stars out of 10. Awful!; This is one of the most ridiculous and crappiest films I have ever seen. It contains some of the WORST acting you will see and that is on top of a plot which is thin to say the least. the cast are plain appalling. Don't waste your time on this crap! The first death is a joke with me actually thinking the thing was going to be someone dreaming before it got onto the proper story...it wasn't - from then on it it gets worse! Rent out SAW or SAW 2 or just go to bed...it really is that bad! Apparently this rant has to go on for ten lines which is why I typed this last sentence, the movie didn't justify another line though so hence the muttering last lines! Mindhunters - is a VERY!!!; It's impossible to understand why the most of these people, who said, that they watched this film and didn't like it, call themselves \"Real Movie Profy\". When I first watched an ATB's videoclip \"Marrakech\", I've understood: I must see this movie. I can't say anything about the movie special effects (may be some films have much more impressive graphics), but the atmosphere and the storyline of \"Mindhunters\" is so unbelievable, so mysterious, so interesting; the film's atmosphere keeps you in suspension from the very beginning to the last end. So, I think, that everybody, who didn't like it very much, doesn't even understand the real 'scary and mysterious' atmosphere of the REAL THRILLER! And what about a storyline of the film, may be sometimes it may seen like strange and may be some moments of storyline are not so perfectly made, but this film is the much more 'storylineous', than most of modern films. So, I can give you (for people who didn't like this movie or didn't understand it) a tip: \"Review this movie!\"... Flawed but Extremely Underrated Thriller.; This long delayed suspense thriller was filmed in 2002 and it is finally getting released in North America. The Premise of Mindhunters is a good one. The Story is about Seven Promising FBI Profilers (Kathryn Morris, Jonny Lee Miller, Clifton Collins Jr., Patricia Velasquez, Eion Bailey, Will Kemp and Christian Slater) are becoming F.B.I. Agents but they have to finish one last course to become full time agents. Their Captain (Val Kilmer) is sending them to an island that is completely isolated. The students last training is profiling the fictional Serial Killer by the name of The Puppeteer. The students are sent to the island along with an mysterious law officer (LL Cool a.k.a-James Todd Smith). Once they are on that island, they are alone and forced to play the game. But when one of the profilers dies, then the game turns real and they are forced to profile each other. Also who so the real killer in this island or it is One of Them in the group ? This entertaining film is directed by Renny Harlin (Exorcist:The Beginning, Die Hard 2:Die Harder, Cliffhanger). Harlin shows some strong visual style and the film is surprisingly suspenseful. Although this thriller has at times an uneasy mix of a slasher film. The film suffers some predicable moments. But the film does have a few memorable death scenes. This film nearly went Direct to Video back in 2004, because Miramax/Dimension Films didn't know how to market the film and Harlin kept re-editing the film by finding the right pace for this thriller. 20th Century Fox wanted to buy the film from Miramax/Dimension Films but the Weinstein brothers, who own Miramax/Dimensnion Films didn't want to sell the film. This film went to be released in Overseas before it open in North America. This Film-Mindhunters received some critical notices from several top critics. Mindhunters was probably a mess, while filming and Miramax/Dimension Films could never give the film a release date starting from early winter-2003. The film is finally released in North America on May 13, 2005. When the film is finally released in the U.S., the film turned into a Box Office flop. Mindhunters will probably be released to DVD, anytime soon and the film should grow to be a Cult Favorite. Let's hope upcoming DVD release of this film should have an audio commentary track by Harlin, Deleted Scenes and Alternative Endings. Region one DVD doesn't have Deleted Scenes or Alternative Ending but it does have an interesting audio commentary track by the director and three featurettes. This is Certainly Harlin's best film, since the underrated \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\". Harlin is also One of the film's Executive Producers. Super 35. (****/*****). This Season of Survivor is All FBI, All Action, All Idiots; Director Renny Harlin is very much a paracinematic man, and his particular brand of style fits perfectly in the early 2000s aesthetic of excess. High concept thrillers such as Speed rely on an exponentially thrilling pace. Moving the plot along faster than the viewer brain can comprehend the inherent silliness of the core concept. Since Fincher's Se7en, thrillers have taken the macabre turn in the crime genre. Reaching the point of Wan's Saw set within one of those trials of torture. Mindhunters similarly attempts the same zenith, upping Se7en's police duo with a ragtag team of FBI agents, racing to solve an ongoing test of intelligence and insanity. Despite the blatant exposition and character development, none of these people seem smarter than Pitt's hardheaded detective. The agents muster a fun mix of \"oh, they've come a long way since\" and \"oh... who?\" Notable entertainers here are Johnny Lee Miller sporting his best Blanche DuBois, Christian Slater and Val Kilmer competing in their natural friendly-yet-suspicious-yet-bored acting styles, and LL Cool J acting as if he was John McClane in yet another preposterous scenario. Attempting to outdo predecessors with 'bigger is better', the story takes place on an isolated island complete with an entire city simulation for a training exercise. According to their teacher, representative of \"the mind of a sociopath\", presumably not meaning laughably inane and ridiculously convenient for the killer's grand scheme. The film, of course, never slows down to let you question how the entire plot hinges of this arbitrary setting. The script of Mindhunters is definitely where entertainment hinges on as Harlin desperately races ahead of logic and common sense. For such a complex and convoluted mystery build, there are a remarkable number of legitimate plant and pay-offs. Many of them are obvious enough to predict despite the suspension of disbelief being thoroughly tested. Much how Jigsaw relies on sheer chance amidst his philosophical soliloquies, a great number of set-pieces and foreshadowing relies on pure coincidence. The script is constantly testing whether these characters are supposed geniuses outmatched or merely idiots outwitted by another idiot. One particular if insignificant moment of clumsy writing is the repeated mantra of a situation only being secure \"on the drive home\", the heroes of course proving this right... when boarding a helicopter to safety. Could've easily been fixed for \"on the way home\" but it doesn't affect the story. In a world of post-modern, meta-narrative ironies, Harlin is successful in his sheer earnestness for pure, dumb, entertainment. For a film about investigative geniuses battling a criminal mastermind, it's best to leave your brain at the door. Wow!; I can't understand why this movie ain't have about 8 points in IMDb... and why everybody say that it's a bad movie, when it actually is Harlin's best movie (even better than Deep Blue Sea) I enjoyed it really much... I was totally surprised at the end... I thin that many of those who give this film 1-6 points don't really now what are saying or didn't understand the film or maybe just hate some actor in the film and that's why they give so stupid points. This movie even scared me and I never would though that it's really that good movie!! but I don't want to tell anything from the movie because I don't want to spoil your movie experience. Sorry if my language is not so good but I hope you understand what I try to tell you... Great movie, everybody must see this masterpiece. One of the best movies I ever have seen in this kind of genre. I give 9/10 for this movie. They were hunting minds, but they forgot to bring their own; Renny Harlin isn't exactly known for making intelligent movies, but at least they're usually quite enjoyable. \"Mindhunters\", however, is so utterly stupid that it's hard to get any kind of enjoyment out of it, apart from maybe some unintentionally funny bits. The concept behind Mindhunters (group of people get stuck somewhere with a killer on the loose) is OK, and it has lead to some exciting movies in the past, including Harlin's own \"Deep Blue Sea\", which, while also very stupid, at least didn't take itself seriously. Unfortunately, \"Mindhunters\" does. And that's were the problems start. \"Mindhunters\" is about a group of supposedly talented FBI trainees getting stuck on an island. Before long, a mysterious killer starts killing them off one by one, using increasingly more elaborate traps (think \"Final Destination\"). The first problem with this is that the traps that are used are so ridiculously complicated and depend on so much circumstances that in real life, they would have a one in a billion chance of succeeding. They would also take hours to set up, time that simply no character has since they're all together almost all the time. Next, although the main characters are supposed to be trained professionals, they immediately crack up after the first murder, and start panicking and wildly accusing each other for so reason whatsoever. Yeah right. The list of implausibilities and plot holes goes on and on, right up to the conclusion that makes no sense whatsoever, and seems to be there only for shock value. All of this might have worked if the movie hadn't taken itself so seriously, or if there had been any other redeeming qualities. There aren't. The acting is poor, none of the characters are even remotely interesting or even likable, and there's hardly any humor in the entire movie (in spite of LL Cool J's presence). The only small point of light in this mess are some of the murders, which, granted, are fairly spectacular. \"Mindhunters\" is a movie that asks of you to completely abstain from using your brain for about over one and a half hours, for only a couple of seconds of gore. If you ask me, that's a pretty poor trade-off. There's nothing wrong with a bit of mindless entertainment, but this goes beyond any reasonable limit. *1/2 out of ***** His Weakness..Bulletts....; A group of seven FBI trainees are sent to an isolated island for the final stage of their training period, under the direction of eccentric Jake Harris, who uses questionable methods. However, they are attacked and killed by a serial killer,whom is one of the team members. The tension increases amidst the group with the lack of confidence on each other...Renny Harlin hasn't really made an impact with movies since the long kiss goodnight, and I for think his career never really got over 'Cutthroat Island' or Geena Davis. Here he gets the best B-movie actors of the year, and makes something which is not dissimilar to 2002's Stallone movie D-Tox. But instead of them sharing the same problem, here they are targeted for their 'weaknesses', which is a novel idea, but since the best kill is the first one and the most famous actor in the whole thing (bar Kilmer) it soon loses it's pace along the way. The editing is dire, and really affects the film in some scenes, but thanks to the performances from the cast, the film is watchable enough for it to warrant a second viewing eight years down the line, because to be honest, your only going to remember Slater being frozen in half.. If not for COLD CASE, would probably not be released; First heard about this movie from an article in FANGORIA magazine a couple years back. Finally saw it last year on a bootleg DVD. It was definitely derivative, but fairly enjoyable. The acting was decent--the biggest problem is the weak screenplay. There is a fair amount of suspense, and some grisly (though physically impossible) murder scenes. I believe MINDHUNTERS is getting a theatrical release here mainly to capitalize on the popularity of Kathryn Morris, who is currently starring in COLD CASE on CBS. I've only seen one commercial for MINDHUNTERS so far, so I don't know if the ad campaign will single her out or not. Does what it needs.; It never seizes to amaze me why certain people choose to overly criticize a movie that is clearly made for the sole purpose of entertaining you for a couple of hours. Mindhunters delivers exactly what it promises, a nice thriller that works moviewize rather well, sure it is nothing new or incredible but does it have to be ? I found it a nice way to relax in comfy theater seats munching popcorn while at it, there was no perticular scene or place in the movie that made me wince, it worked from start to end well. Forget the nay sayers and just go enjoy it. Some of the stuff in this film is so over the top; I saw this last year and thought that some of it was so over the top it was unbelievable, the 'anti smoking' bit would be a harrowing advert! Yeah some of the deaths are a bit overdone but it's a good movie I enjoyed it, thought it was pretty good, and kept me guessing etc etc, the acting and directing was good I think any major problems is a writers fault more then the cast/crew! My friends thought it was good too so its not just a personal opinion but yeah like any movie its gonna have people who love it and people who hate it its the same with any film made right? But yes I gave it a 5/10 and maybe I was being a little harsh but it's worth a watch! Just When you think you've got it figured out, you don't; This is a very entertaining thriller/suspense movie that keeps you thinking and hooked right up until the very end. If for some reason you realize you won't be able to finish this movie then turn it off within the first half hour. because after the first half hour you will be absolutely hooked until the very end. trust me you will not figure this one out unless you pay extreme attention to detail and even more to plot and characteristics. Pesronally i do pay extreme attention to detail and this movie surprised me. Mindhunters has it's flaws and it is very graphicly violent so i give it a 9 out of 10. Incredibly stupid way of wasting your time; I can't believe I sat thru the entire movie but maybe it was because of my wife. A whodunnit so-called-thriller edited MTV-style for the teens just to keep you believing that time is running involves 7 FBI wannabe profilers on a drill getting killed one by one in very ingenious and clever ways. You got no time to get in the mood, no time to get to know them better, no time to admire the shots and you wonder how the hell the killer got time to set up all the traps. At the end, I shaked my head in disbelief at the Talking Killer-scene...the whole movie is a pathetic attempt at the whodunnit-genre. okay pot boiler; Hard to believe that Christian Slater was once a big star looking at this, he is reduced to a semi-cameo in a \"B\" picture. It's an okay set up, group of FBIers being picked off by booby traps with the twist that the people in question are warned of the time the next trap will go off. There is an evil genius obviously at work and the people being to suspect each other. You need to suspend disbelieve but if you are willing to do that it's okay. The traps are always every involved and the people are always standing in a particular spot. The traps aren't like claymore mines that take out a whole group but are targeted at a specific spot where someone is standing. Since the buildings are booby trapped why do they stay there? Why doesn't the FBI screen it's people better? Why does the test have to take place with all communication cut off? What if someone had a burst appendix? Why do the people not suspect anything when something happens that it's obvious the \"puppet master\" wants them to take action on? Still think Christian Slater could do better if given a chance. Frighteningly stereotypical; I was enjoying myself through about 20% of the film. Then I realized that even though I've never seen this film before, never read about it, or even seen the poster, I've seen it a hundred times. The last 80% were easily predicted by looking back at every slasher film, lousy thriller and wannabe psycho thriller that's been released the last 10 years. The plot and script is so thin that it couldn't take much more than a day or two to reinvent completely, and the movie seems to rely only on gory details for entertainment and \"suspense\". The only reason I give this film a few points is that ONE scene during the whole movie managed to catch me off guard, and even surprised me a bit. If you're utterly desperate to watch a movie - any movie - and don't have anything else available in the house, this film may be OK to watch. Other than that; don't touch it with a ten-foot pole. Bloody brilliant; I like movies that keep me guessing, this one had me going all the way through. I was glued to my seat and really fell in love with all the characters. The way the plot opened up was pretty special its a real work of art the way the scripts and the directing come together. I loved the darkness and the constant guessing \"is it you, because you said that\" sort of thing. TOTALLY did not expect that ending at all it came as quite a shock, it was so well written that even i didn't guess who it was although i think that because of the way the writers didn't know who it was going to be until the last moment kind of helped out there. If you can get past the slight gore in the movie its dam good and well worth seeing. Marina:) A very good thriller.; Mindhunters is a very good thriller with lots of shocks, scares and surprises. There is a lot of suspense and unexpected jumps. The thing I like about this movie is that it makes you think that one person is the bad guy then you find out it is not and then the next person is suspected for being the bad guy. In other words, there are a lot of red herrings and lot of mystery to it. The plot of this movie. A group of FBI profiler trainees are sent to a military island facility to train their profiling abilities and teamwork. But when one of their teammates is killed during a supposed simulation, they try to get off the island. Then they begin to suspect that the killer is among them. I like the cinematography of this movie. This movie has a very good look to it. The acting is also very well done. Especially Kathryn Morris. And hands off to LL Cool J. In every scene he is in, he just brings in a lot of life to them. That is how good he is. If you like mindhunters, I would recommend copycat. Whaaaa?; This movie is ridiculous. I saw it at the dollar theater. I think it was definitely worth $1, if only for how hilarious it was. I have to say the first death is the best. Liquid nitrogen causing a man to freeze and break off at the ankles? I saw the movies with a group of chemistry majors; I think we disturbed the whole theater with our laughter. Also the acid laced cigarette. It seemed to keep eating through her body even after she fell in the water. Hydrofluoric maybe? All in all this movie was entertaining. The only aspect I found irritating was the constant accusations that went on throughout the film (especially directed towards LL Cool J). Too much back and forth yelling and screaming. Best part is when LL shoots holds in the wall to use for a sweet traverse climb. Rock on LL. The FBI killing the FBI...; Seven FBI trainees are training to become elite profilers, in order to succedd they have to do a training simulation on an island where they are supposed to find a serial killer, of course the mission is just a game to see who handles situations in the best way possible. But the game quickly changes to fatal reality when someone takes the game too seriously. Now the quickly decreasing number of seven people have to find out who's setting up traps for them on the island but it's not that easy when they're the only ones on the island. Well the plot is something I suppose, a serial killer picking off the FBI trainees one by one, instead of using the usual Knife, Machete or Chainsaw, this killer cleaverly uses specially timed inventive traps, you see this Killer has studied each member of the trainees habits and so knows what can kill them, they're goal is to try find out who this killer is and play him or her at they're own game, before they all end up dead. \"Mindhunters\" has a number of famous faces such as rapper/singer/actor LL Cool J (Deep Blue Sea Halloween (HZO), Christian Slater (Broken Arrow & Alone In The Dark), Val Kilmer (Top Gun & Batman Forever), Johnny Lee Miller (Trainspoting), Kathryn Norris (Minorty Report and TV'S Cold Case) and Patrica Velaquez (The Mummy Returns) Being the slasherfan that I am, it's nice to be able to enjoy a slasher where the killer doesn't wear a mask and the cast doesn't consist of a bunch of good looking teens who can't act. Not having these two factors, just proves that the story is stronger than most modern slashers, it's a shame that movie ended being shevled for years and wasn't a success at the box office but to me that doesn't matter because this is one hell of gem of a movie. Each cast member brings they're own unique talent to the roles of this movie, yes even LL Cool J who I don't think much of as a singer, but in this movie he plays a strong lead character in this movie, Christian Slater is also solid in his short screen time, Johnny Lee Miller shows depths to his character as the movie goes on and both the female leads are great as well Kathryn Norris plays cat and mouse with the unknown killer and plays the killer at his own game. The deaths in this movie are cool and inventive, we get a guy iced then breaks into pieces, a decapitation, a guy gets speared through the chest and we also get something completely new death by cigarettes, laced with acid and let's just say smoking is bad for your health. All in all there's a little something for everyone in this movie, there's the horror, action and a bit of CSI, well recommend this movie to anyone. A very intelligent movie; I saw the DVD tonight. I consider this one of the finest psychological thrillers since \"se7en\". The movie is brilliantly written and directed. The story proves itself; you don't need mega stars to sell it. The plot is not flawless, but it is convincing. It keeps the audiences guessing till the end. Without reveal much of the story, I have to give the credit about how the killer is been revealed. Surprise, Surprise! To director, Renny Harlin, you have finally redeemed yourself from your last flopped \"Driven\". Leave your mind at home; If LL Cool J is in a film it means that acting skills are optional. The rest of the film requires you to believe that someone had the remarkable ability to set all the events up knowing the script in advance. Because the events that occur could only have happened if you could see the script in advance. So these clowns are supposed to be FBI agents. Yet vending machines magically dispense things in a highly suspicious fashion and the agent is not surprised by this? This is a true idiot's delight. Sadly this has every type of amateur associated with it. There are truly horrible elements created solely just to create screams from the audience. It probably took a crew time to set up that scene, but somehow we're supposed to believe that the killer was able to set up this entire elaborate scene all by himself. And then the great finale, which would have made Jacques Cousteau envious. It's a comedy in the absurd. Leave it to these clowns to take exaggeration to the max. It takes a special type of low talent hack to come up with this pitiful waste of film. I give it a 3 for the actors who try to do what they can with this script. They weren't terrible, just made to do some very dumb things. A great Harlin picture; I can't remember when last enjoyed watching a picture by Renny Harlin but this was truly a good movie. This thriller is everything You want from thriller: surprising, speedy and exciting. Harlin is proved his skills as a action-director already with Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger but in my opinion this is his best movie and it's a pity that the studio executives don't trust Renny, well he has made some awful movies in his time but he has potential, this movie for example is a very beautiful one, a virtue normally not connected with Harlin pictures. I feel sorry for Harlin that this movie never got into theaters in the US. It certainly would have deserved a chance. Silly But Entertaining; \"Mindhunters\" is a silly, but highly entertaining mystery. The real mystery is why the movie was delayed for two years by Dimension Films. The plot: 7 FBI profilers are put on an remote island for training about serial killers. Little do they know that a real killer is on the loose tracking them one by one. Not killing them outright, but setting traps. The mystery aspect of the film is different and there are a lot of twists. The deaths are also original. SPOILERS BELOW!!!!! Slater's and Kilmer's death are the standouts. Slater's character is the first victim who gets frozen by liquid nitrogen and shatters into pieces. Kilmer's character was strung up with hooks like a puppet. The only problem with the movie is the ending. It's very lame and it hurts the film greatly.

So be ready the next time they show the awards, I'll be the guy with long hair and glasses! Terrible Movie; What floored me the most was how the FBI agents acted through out the movie. Let's face it, if these are supposed to be Americas best then no wonder they couldn't stop 9/11. Each of them acted like a 20 year college student instead of a professional FBI agent. There was arguing, fighting, finger pointing, and just plain silly thinking. Not once did they ever stop and try to analyze the situation and find a solution out of their situation. I had to laugh when one of the agents suggested that another should shoot a handcuffed suspect, so that they wouldn't have to worry about her anymore. I'm sure that would have looked good on the IL'resume. In the end I found the movie a complete waste of time. Another weak excuse to show gore and torture; Let's see: A group of folks (in this case FBI agents training to be serial killer profilers) are thrown together on an island to solve a simulation. Oh, wait: suddenly they realize it's not a simulation. Wait again: one of them may be the killer. Wait a 3rd time: one by one they are killed off, each new killing pointing to a different member. And, yup, the killings are really nasty with folks beheaded, burned by acid and (especially) strung up by wire and fish hooks. A serious actor like Kilmer should be ashamed of participating in worthless sh*t such as this. When are folks going to stop supporting movies like this, Seven, Silence of the Lambs, and other gory cr*p? This is nothing more that a shallow excuse to show excessive torture and nastiness. We've got enough of that in the real world. Let's not keep feeding it. What's especially sad about these kinds of movies is the high percentage of women who enjoy them. Women are fighting hard to stop violence at home, in the workplace and on the streets. Suggest you start pushing Hollywood too and stop encouraging this garbage. Utter nonsense, but fun anyway.; A team of aspiring FBI profilers are flown to a remote island called Oneiga where others of their kind are trained. Overseen by an eccentric supervisor, Harris (Val Kilmer), their skills are put to the ultimate test when it seems that one of them has caught the killing bug themselves. And this psychopath knows just how to play to the skills and weaknesses of each character. Tensions flare among the group when they take turns suspecting each other. Renny Harlin, director of such epics as \"Die Hard 2\" and \"Cliffhanger\", is clearly the right kind of guy for this sort of popcorn fare. It's pretty slick stuff, and the story *is* entertaining if also ridiculous at every turn. It's shot in a visually stark manner, with an almost monochromatic look. The production design by Charles Wood is pretty damn impressive. Things get rather gory at times, but suspense is minimal. Although the screenplay by Wayne Kramer (director of \"The Cooler\" and \"Running Scared\" (2006)) is always taking turns making characters look suspicious, ultimately the big reveal is not terribly surprising. This viewer was reminded of John Carpenters' \"The Thing\" while watching (there's even a blood testing plot point). The closest thing that the story has to a likable, sympathetic character is Sara Moore (Kathryn Morris); there just aren't that many people here worth giving a damn about. Not that the actors can be faulted. Morris is an appealing lead, while LL Cool J is given the opportunity to show off his physique, commit heroic acts, and basically be a bad ass. Eion Bailey, Clifton Collins Jr., Will Kemp, Jonny Lee Miller, Christian Slater, and Patricia Velasquez co-star. Slater has quite a memorable departure from the story. Overall, this is rather silly, but it entertains in its own crazed way. Seven out of 10. \"Are you having fun? I'm having fun.\"; When 'Mindhunters' finally made it's plunge into the movie theaters, I didn't get around to see it. It was released the same week as a couple of other more appealing films and I guess I just missed it on my 'to watch' list. For the longest time I figured this was a positive thing because of the film's extremely negative buzz. 'Mindhunters', the mind-teasing thriller about six wannabe F.B.I. profilers being stalked, toyed with and murdered one by one during a field exercise, was supposed to be released in 2002, but didn't get released until early this year. When a movie is delayed release for three years it can really only mean one thing -- it is unbelievably dreadful. I rented a copy of 'Mindhunters' while on vacation in Spain two weeks ago only because it was the only new film available I didn't already see. I was expecting it to be pure trash not only because of all the distribution problems and delays, but because it was directed by one of Hollywood's most overrated and talentless hacks, Renny Harlin (remember Cutthroat Island, YUCK!). When the film was over, I have to tell you I was pleasantly surprised. 'Mindhunters' isn't a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it entertains and offers cheesy but very fun plot twists. If you can just watch it without analyzing it, I assure all the action/gore fans out there that they will enjoy it. I know I did. The movie follows seven F.B.I. profilers in training -- Sara (Kathryn Morris - TV's 'Cold Case'), Lucas (Jonny Lee Miller - Trainspotting), Bobby (Eion Bailey - HBO's 'Band of Brothers'), Vince (Clifton Collins, Jr. - Traffic), Rafe (Will Kemp - Van Helsing), Nicole (Patricia Velasquez - The Mummy) and J.D. (Christian Slater - Windtalkers). They are led by a tough-as-nails and dry-witted F.B.I. Psychological Profiling Trainer with unorthodox methods, Jake Harris (Val Kilmer - Spartan). Jake takes his protégés to a deserted island owned by the F.B.I. for field exercises, to put them through a final test. They will be alone on the island and will be required to solve and complete certain obstacles. Joining the seven profilers in training is the L.A.P.D.'s Gabe Jensen (LL Cool J - S.W.A.T.) who is sent from headquarters to pick up a few things from the training program. When the eight souls are alone on the island, what they think to be the training exercise begins. When one of the eight is killed, they realize it's not a training exercise at all and someone is after them. But there is only one problem -- they are the only people on the island. That is when the real mystery and fun starts to get rolling in Renny Harlin's 'Mindhunters', one of the better films on Harlin's resume. I actually enjoyed 'Mindhunters', but I wouldn't call it a good film. It keeps you entertained, but hardly anything in the movie is original. Renny Harlin really does a so-so job directing (nothing too bad, but nothing too great either). The script is full of exhilarating and thrilling moments, but it is also jammed to the brim with tired and overused scenarios, painful to listen to dialogue and some really hoaky one-liners that you'd expect to see in an 80s Canadian Made-For-TV crime caper starring Corey Haim or Kirk Cameron. The acting is a mixed bag in 'Mindhunters', with top of the line performances from Kilmer and Slater, bottom of the barrel performances from Clifton Collins, Jr. and Patricia Velasquez, strictly average performances from Bailey and Kemp, a slightly above average performance from Kathryn Morris (the hero of the story), a more or less good performance from rapper turned actor LL Cool J and a beyond disappointing performance from the great British actor Jonny Lee Miller (once married to Hollywood psychopath Angelina Jolie) who provides us with an embarrassingly bad American accent that drifts from American to British to Southern to various unintelligible accents. I recommend renting 'Mindhunters' when it comes to American video stores if you are looking for mindless fun and don't mind some graphic and gritty aftermaths of violent deaths and a few kitty cat corpses. Grade: C+ my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces). A Bloated Mess Of A Film...; I watched MINDHUNTERS with a group of people whose sole basis for the success of a film depends on whether or not they could figure out who the \"bad guy\" was.  They could not, so they deemed it a \"very good\" movie, much to my chagrin.  They seemed to completely miss the fact that nowhere in MINDHUNTERS do the film-makers make any attempt at a plausible story line or characters that have any kind of dimension at all.  The screenwriter creates flat confused pawns that inhabit a hopelessly labyrinthine world that defies all bounds of logic.  The viewer not only has to suspend disbelief, but must place it in a wastepaper basket and burn it. O.K., the story as I remember it:  A group of trainees for the F.B.I. (or some other stock agency that would result in training on an abandoned island) go to an abandoned island.  The mastermind of the group is a guy played by Val Kilmer (in a glorified cameo that receives top billing), and a bunch of other people (amongst them Christian Slater and L.L. Cool J.) who fall victim to elaborate traps--most of which would have have taken an entire day to set up, although the cast is together on screen most of the time.  Does that mean the killer isn't one of the group?  Who cares?  I don't want reveal any of the implausible plot twists (except the ones I reveal below); they have to be seen to be believed anyway.  It would take more time to rationalize this festering spaghetti bowl of a movie then I really would like to dedicate to such an amateurish and laughable film. Examples and !!**SPOILERS**!!:  One of the group is dying for a cigarette. While out walking by herself, with a killer on the loose, she notices a pack of smokes fall out of the machine.  Well, what does she do?  Realizes the obvious trap that has been set?  No...she smokes one and dies horribly. Huh?  Apparently the future members of this elite shadowy agency are half-wits that deserve to die.  It just goes on and on like this for the length of the film.  This is even worse than director Renny Harlin's previous film STRIKING DISTANCE, and that was a pretty god-awful piece of crap. Anyway, if you like being tricked by a movie (even at the cost of honest characters and a clever plot), then MINDHUNTERS fits the bill.  But, if you are opposed to be shamelessly manipulated by a witless and obvious thriller...stay far away from this disaster.  1/10. Surprisingly Entertaining; Knowing Renny Harlin's track record, you never know what to expect from the Finnish director. It seems it's more or less random which of his films turn out to be crap or really quite good. I didn't know what to expect here, and maybe my low expectations were part of the reason why i found this film to be surprisingly entertaining. The setup is pretty standard-fare for a serial-killer film. What makes this different is the victims. They are FBI-agents in training to become profilers. Their teacher is Jake Harris (Val Kilmer) who likes to use special methods while training his agents. As a test the profilers-to-be are sent out to an army training facility on a desolate island. A small town is built on the island and the morning after their arrival a murder will have happened in the town, their job is to find the killer. Something goes wrong however and it seems the game has become real, a killer really is on the loose and now he's chasing them. To say that this story is unbelievable and forced is an understatement. The whole set-up with an abandoned island feels a bit cheap, a lame excuse to get the agents alone in a place from which there is no escape. But if you can accept that particular bit of plot then the rest is not bad at all. The atmosphere is well built and the suspense is thick. Also most of the actors do a pretty good job creating that \"anyone-could-be-guilty\"-feeling. So, even though the serial-killer thing has been done a thousand times and even though the set-up here is even less believable than usual, this is still an enjoyable experience. It might not be revolutionary, and it might not be something you'll remember for very long. But if you like this kind of movie you will at least be entertained for as long as it lasts. I rate it 6/10. Is it ethical to use a serial killer to prove your point?; Such a film is to be discovered directly. There is no possible summarizing it without destroying its force and its effect. Let's say seven young FBI agents are being trained to become profilers. The teacher is harsh with them because he seems to find them too weak. The last test is to drop them on a totally abandoned and deserted island announcing there is a serial killer with them. And they have three or four days to profile him or her, and what's more they have a chaperon from the Department of Justice. Good luck, Good bye and Good adventure ahead. And they discover very fast there is a serial killer among them, but they do not know who. And there everything goes wrong for them. Thank you Agatha Christie and her \"Ten Little N***s\", or \"Murder By Death\" used as models. The details are in the film. The film demonstrates how these young agents have none of the necessary qualities to become profilers, and particularly the capacity to remain cool, cold and self controlled if they don't want to fall in the traps the serial killer is laying in front of them. And lose their cool they all will, dramatically and pay for their mistake with their lives. But the best profiler of them all is absent, it is the teacher who had profiled the serial killer among them and knew this one will not stop at anything at all to be the only one to survive and get the degree. But we could wonder if that is not a subtle way of being a killer too: by using the unconscious and unsolicited services of a real killer to prove his point: these young people are not serious future profilers and have to be eliminated. And that brings the film to the level of a metaphor of society. Only the best one survives any test, or the survivor of an elimination game is the best one. True or False? The film leans towards true. I think it could have been slightly more subtle. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines This would be awesome if you had never seen a mystery/thriller before...; ...but, as I have seen mysteries and thrillers before, this movie ends up a few tacos short of a combo meal in the grand scheme of things. It's pretty good though, and it was a very entertaining watch. The characters are fleshed out pretty well and the plot is well executed. The setting is great, and you're kept in due suspense at who exactly is the killer for the first hour or two of the movie. The acting is generally okay, and there's a good use of atmosphere here. I did like how each character was given their own strengths and weaknesses to be used against them, that was good. And the special effects were cool sometimes, but lame at others. But this movie tries to do too much, reaching for heights it can't quite grasp. It's all very well done, but towards they end they start throwing in so many 'plot twists' that it gets really predictable and irritating. We've seen most of these type of plot twists before, and although they're done well, there was no need to do it so many damn times and drag out the ending of the movie for another 20 minutes. Other random gripes: The gore often looked terribly fake The action wasn't that good. Looked genuinely fake as well. But overall I liked it alright. It's not a classic, but it does a pretty okay job for this type of film. Fans of the genre won't find anything new, but they will find an enjoyable 'popcorn' type of mystery flick. Recommended. DO NOT EVEN THINK ON THIS FILM; This is one of the worst films seen lately by mankind. Don't repeat my mistake and waste 90 minutes of your life on it. Every frame of it is like a nail in your eyes, brain, taste and hope in cinema as art. The plot is predictable, the cast is not worthy (but for LL Cool J, whose work is almost acceptable- wow, beautiful body, mate-), dialogs are empty and exist only to make the plot survive, ad-hoc editing, too much like an MTV video; a film based only on effects. By effects I mean loud noise when the director needs tension, but no tension filmed at all. That kind of effect. Simply put, it seems like the director is always thinking \"Hey, my audience might fall in deep sleep, so I better put in much noise and easy explanations of the plot\". I guess you won't like it if you feel insulted like that. *****POSSIBLE SPOILER***** Characters just fool around until they're killed. The killer is poorly explained and lacks of anything remotely resembling a three-dimensional personality. Go and do something better with your life and you money, you won't regret it. Stood The Test Of Time; Sometimes, I wonder why such awesome films as Mindhunters was bashed by film critics and was a flop in theaters. Released in 2004, it has stood the test of time well and is viewed very fresh and well now. The reason - shorter time, excellent cast, with Jonny Lee Miller, Kathryn Morris and LL Cool J among the best, excellent pacing and very good camera work. I do recommend this FBI mouse-cat-whodunnit-drama as it offers many thrills and holds you at the edge of your seat. Excellent nail-biting thriller where you never guess who the main culprit is till the very end. It is also fine for its correct dark navy color scheme and very menacing cold atmosphere of fear and suspicion. My rate is 10 A gruesome cinematic gem; Who could have seen this coming? After years of sitting on a shelf and picking up a nasty rep, \"Mindhunters\" has blitzed theaters outside the US. To my surprise the film is actually cult classic material and not a bomb in the least. \"Mindhunters\" has a narrative akin to a bullet train at mach speed that nearly flies off the track into the abyss, but does not and in the process becomes a cinematic gem for the true fan of the genre. I am shocked (after seeing \"Mindhunters\") that this is not getting support in North America, as it has potential to do very well as it has here. Excellent flick. Four stars out of five good actors \"cook\" an excellent thriller; This movie is an example of a good thriller recipe. It has a graduate suspense, you never know how things will evolve and if you think you do, you are wrong. It combines psychological hints with rising terror and the result is breathtaking. Most of the actors are well known and this story could happen in real life too, producers didn't exaggerate the elements much out of the ordinary. The location of the action, a deserted island, is great for the plot, as it provides several different sceneries giving diversity to the action. The characters are well outlined, each has his/her personality, habits or weakness that define them. The actors also spice up the characters and have been well chosen for this movie. The tension increases and it never stops,not even at the end, you keep watching out for traps until the final minute. So I recommend you see it and I am sure even the most critical ones of you will at least enjoy it! Affable if vacuous time-waster; Renny Harlin once more gathers up a cast of has beens and never-were's to play out the \"And then there were none\" suspense dynamics he tested out on Deep Blue Sea. As usual with Renny, it all goes by at a fair enough pace and looks nice, but it's best to check your brain on the way in. This time the incredibly daft high concept plot has a gang of misfit serial killer profilers taken to an island by Val Kilmer's super profiler professor, who's in need of a haircut. Once there, the exercise turn serious as one of them is revealed to be a serial killer themselves. The gradually diminishing pool of profilers have to figure out who before they meet their own ends thanks to the ridiculously, comically over-elaborate traps left by the killer. who prays on their weaknesses. The main flaw is just how stupidly elaborate those evil death traps are - never mind a couple of hours, some would take an engineering and electronics degree and a few days. And being world domino champion would help. The cast does okay, without anyone standing out. Some of the characters do some really dumb and out of character things in order to keep Renny's shock machine on the move. It's not going to change your life or give you bad dreams, but it's not bad. Harlin will have to raise his game at some point though, if he really expects to keep getting gigs. A TV show is also in the offing. Presumably this will take forward the \"group of profilers\" angle rather than the \"getting a bunch of people onto an island and killing them\" one, as it's likely to be more sustainable. Utter nonsense; This film is poorly made and entirely uninteresting. No character is ever developed beyond a cardboard cutout and so no character is actually interesting. The monotony of a stupidly contrived drama where characters die one by one - in itself such a tired device - makes the very hook as to who in fact is behind the killings non-existent. Who cares ? And doubly so when for even those of us who absented themselves from all science classes throughout their schooling recognise the killing 'traps' as completely implausible and absurd. The chasms of illogic, which have left discerning audiences weeping with laughter and a right to demand the return of monies paid with interest, receive a hasty and unbelievable explanation from the killer in act 3. One can almost hear the rumblings of the dimwitted story telling minds behind this extravaganza of crappy horror trying to ensure the film at least had some credible base. The group responsible for this heap of festering excreta surely must have included cynical investors, the creatively challenged and hunters of the mindless. Great Movie.Great Death Scenes!; This film was good as hell.The death scene where the best since Final Destination 1 & 2.All though I didn't finish watching it,but from what I watch,it was good as hell. This flick is about an F.B.I. training task team,who are put on a romote island to train.There mission is to catch an fake killer named The Puppeter.But something's wrong,people are really dying and the ones who are left are trying to find out who the killer is.Is it one of them,is it a real killer,is it something monstrous.Watch it and find out. I didn't finish watching it,so I don't know who the killer is.But from what I watch it is sweet.The death scene are brillant and scary.I thought I was watching a horror film when I seen this,because I jumped every time somebody died.Great film and great death scenes. Formulaic, but fun; I watched this last night and throughly enjoyed it. Shot with a similar style and flair to Harlins Deep Blue Sea, the film pushes all the right buttons in all the right places. There is very little original with this film, but each actor does play their parts well. The only real gripe I have, is that when it starts hitting the fan, these highly trained FBI profiler wannabees panic. They seem to forget all that they've learnt making the solution to their problems that much harder. Oh and Johnny Lee Millers accent. Although the \"serial killer\" idea has been done to death, if you'll excuse the pun, there are some clever moments. The domino scene was a nice surprise. Well executed, but just like in Deep Blue Sea, a major player gets bumped off fairly early. I found this a good pizza Sat evening with your buddies kind of movie. Like I said. Formulaic, but fun Worth seeing.....; This is an excellent film; however, do not expect to see the two main characters in the film long. The films more famous actors Val Kilmer (Jake Harris) and Christian Slater (J.D. Reston) are only present in the film approximately fifteen minutes. As a matter of fact, J.D. Reston character's departure is so abrupt it's almost unbelievable. The premise of the film involves a class of seven top FBI agents all vying for FBI \"Profiler\" positions, and a government investigator researching the \"Profiler\" training regiment. The final exam is set on some deserted Navy Seal training island in the middle of no where. While on the island, the agents are to investigate a crime scene, and work up the murder's profile before the weekend's end. However, a real murderer is on the island. The agents become the prey in an elaborate game of cat-and-mouse. As time continues to slip away, the agents are forced to solve complicated puzzles in an attempt to foil the killer's next planned assassination. Whose the killer and who will survive this diabolical scheme is anyone's guess. This is by far my favorite genre of film. The plot sequences are new and inventive; the highly sophisticated nuances just heighten the enjoyment of the film. The entertainment factor is off the scale, I highly recommend this film. My suggestion: Worth the Full Price of Admission; however, it will be available on DVD shortly http://farisreel.com The hunt for a mind...; ...but an unsuccessful one. So what you get is a mindless story with mindless characters and a predictable ending. The story centers around a group of soon to be FBI profilers. To graduate they are flown to a lonely island that belongs to the Navy. They're instructed that a murder will be set up, which they will have to solve successfully. So far so good, but that's as good as it gets. While the idea for this story is pretty promising, the script behind the movie itself is not. Once the group finds the fake murder scene they realize that this was just a set up to ambush them directly. Now, they encounter a series of traps that are set up to kill them all off. The actors do an OK job portraying unbelievable characters and unbelievable they are. Once the action starts, everybody is on the edge like any other victim in any horror movie. However, we're not dealing with unsuspecting victims, but with professionals, who are everything but unsuspecting. And this is just one point where the script loses touch with reality. They soon suspect that the killer is one of them, which in the end proves to be true, but how does that make sense? They were together all the time, yet setting up the traps would have taken a considerable amount of time. Also, the distrust and hate among the group doesn't make much sense either. You'd expect that such a small group of people who has been through the hard school of the FBI would bond pretty much. In fact, team play is one of the qualities that the FBI seeks, yet this movie portrays a group of loners. The fact that the traps are all pretty random and would have been easily avoidable also doesn't get into the way of the movie. Same goes for the fact that they all seem to be nerdy lab rats. At one point they analyze blood and other samples, where you'd have to ask yourself: How come they know how to do that? If you're a profiler, this is not your job. That's what you have labs for. Why are they suddenly experts on biochemistry? How did all the analysis equipment get to the Navy database? Why aren't they earning a fortune by working at pharmaceutical companies, or any other company that pays well for those qualities? How could mentally unstable personalities get as far in the FBI school as they could? These are just a few of the many plot holes. The most annoying one must be the one that they blame themselves for the murders, even though their instructor explicitly said that an extra person would be the puppet master of the murder, yet no one gets the idea that this unknown guy might be responsible. The movie also features terrible one liners, for example \"where there's a skill, there's a weakness\". How does that make sense?? By that logic an unskilled person would have no weaknesses at all. Still, the movie is able to get even worse. In one of the last scenes, the three remaining guys run around the base, shooting dummy targets that pop up from the ground in the hope to kill the puppet master. Well, that a human being just doesn't pop up from the ground in a stiff fashion should be enough not to waste ammo on something like that, yet they all fire away like the brain dead meat puppets they are. This scene only serves the purpose to get rid of the ammo, so that the movie can bore you for 5 more minutes with a ridiculous fight, instead of a quick stand off. All in all, this wouldn't have been half bad if the script wouldn't have abandoned reality just to make its ridiculous storyline and characters work. After all, that's how you distinguish good movies from bad ones. It's not the over the top plot, or exalted characters that make a good movie, but a storyline that is believable enough to have happened in reality. Watch a Grisham movie to see a perfect example for that matter. Anyway, this is worth a rent, but certainly not a buy. deaths too absurd, plot too silly; I don't think this was a very good movie. I like movies about serial killers, but the plot to this one was very silly. And from the first death,J.D., I thought this is going to be bad. J.D. is killed by being sprayed with Nitrogen, which freezes him and he breaks into pieces. That must be the silliest death ever in a movie. I just don't think something like that would be plausible. One guy is found dead after the group wakes up from being drugged. His body looked so fake, just like a mannequin even before the head fell off. The one guy that was a little interesting, Jake Harris, is gone after the first part of the film. And then of course, when we find out who the killer was, it's silly. And Sara Moore is not well written if she was supposed to be the female heroine. FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it. Just an overall bad plot. this movie Rocked!!! , why straight to DVD ?; this film rocked it has 4 big movie actors in it and kathrinne morris (from the hit show cold case). unlike many other serial killer whodunnits this one keeps you guessing right up till the very end and it wasn't afraid to kill-off a major star or 2 to throw you from the usual \"murder she wrote\" style casting. it's slick filming , gripping storyline and clever direction makes me wonder why this didn't go to theaters. one of the finest elements of mindhunters was the way the momentum is thrust forward by the serial killer leaving clues (in the form of broken watches) to indicate when someone will die next, this gives us the opportunity to see the various characters go deeper into fear and paranoia trying to beat the clock to solve how the next person will die and more importantly who that person will be. renny harlin has made some good films in the past and this to me,is one of his best. Crime Thriller Turned Horror Turned Bad; The premise of this crime thriller of FBI profilers being out profiled was a nice idea but the main thrust of this movie turned the more intriguing, intellectual, thriller like \"Manhunter\" or televisions CSI into more of a horror movie with all the mindless trappings of gore from in the more blood and guts teen movies. The set up rapidly descended into stupidity with the profilers seemingly at a loss only to pick later in the movie but too late. The script attempts a double and even triple twist but with interesting but not completely satisfactory results. Unfortunately, this movie's genre was mixed up and the blend of crime thriller and horror thriller made the movie much more bland. From a horror standpoint, a number of the bloody ideas were of some interest and with more sensitivity this movie could have been much better. Nevertheless, the movie managed to salvage some interest, curiosity, doubt but the twists were more confusing and desperate, the martial art scene pretty feeble. In sum, Mindhunters was a nice attempt, commendable efforts by Christian Slater and Val Kilmer whose talents weren't not given sufficient use (especially considering Kilmer's excellent performance in Spartan that came out the same year). An OK movie but could have been a lot better. Six out of Ten Stars. pretty cool; yah, this movie is pretty cool, don't know why its getting trashed so much. it does seem to try too hard to have ll cool j try to throw in some nice \"hip\" lines, and the dialog is mediocre, but i mean besides that the movie is pretty cool. i'm not spoiling anything by saying people are getting killed in this movie, and the way that they get killed is pretty original. taking into consideration the director also directed deep blue sea... just watching it really reminds me of deep blue sea, the plots are different, but the way the movie was created, its extremely similar, so if you liked deep blue sea, you're sure to like this movie. Ridiculous premise...mediocre script...extremely bad casting; This one I had high hopes for, man what a waste of time. My reasoning to watch this was Renny Harlin. He always seems to pick em pretty well. I can't believe he chose to do this . He musta owed someone in the biz a favor. The one spoiler I will mention doesn't actually implicate the actual killer but I thought I'd bring it up for those who like to go back in time and re-think this one. How in the world did he get the time to rig up all these little contraptions in the few hours he was on that island? It's not possible. Totally laughable. With the exception of the night they arrived and slept, when? They're there 2 days and through out this film..they don't sleep and they're in each others company almost the whole time. There's also know way he could have visited the island ahead of time because no-1 knew where they were going until the lead instructor told them the day before. Explain that to me. The premise itself is just stupid cause here in America, we just have that many genius psychos who join the FBI to kill for fun. Just ridiculous. I won't go into detail about the crappy casting but if you can look through the cast here above this review, you'll know what I mean. Still one of my favorite films!; First of all, let me start by saying I've seen this move probably more then 20 times by know. Somehow the story never gets old! Starting with a group of wanna be FBI profilers and their mentor setting out for a deserted island to profile a fictive killer and to earn their stripes as a profiler. Of course the whole thing goes terrible wrong (which is all I'm going to say about that) and the story unfolds from there. There is something about this group of actors and the way they interact with each other that feels so natural, you don't question it. The pace of the movie is very good, with suspense in all the right places. So to summarize: very, very good cast, good acting, nice pace of the movie and a bit (a little bit) of a surprise ending. Definitely a must-see!! A thrilling entertainer...; Mindhunters, a thriller/mystery/action movie, somewhat similar to 2002's D-Tox (or Eye See You), tells the story of a bunch of FBI profilers stuck on an island during an exercise, getting killed one after the other. The film starts off well enough, if a bit predictably, with a sequence that puts you in the mood and gets you interested and intrigued. From then on, director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger,...) keeps a good pace and never lets the viewer get bored. And despite the arguably weak ending, most of the movie's events are unexpected and thrilling. The actors do a pretty good job (othing spectacular, but the script doesn't call for it). A few \"name\" actors are present (Val Kilmer, Christian Slater, LL Cool J), however, like in Renny Harlin's own, and also somewhat similar movie Deep Blue Sea (also with LL Cool J), that doesn't really mean much (I can't go into more detail without revealing spoilers). All-in-all, Mindhunters, scripted by the up-and-coming Wayne Kramer with ghost rewrites from the already-up-there Ehren Kruger, is a solid entertainer which fulfills its promise. And while it's true it could easily have been better, it isn't, and what it is already quite good. Mindhunters; Okay, so I have an affinity for Renny Harlin's Hollywood movies. So sue me, I can't help but enjoy these polished time-wasters. I'm also a sucker for these FBI crime thrillers where someone is not who they seem. On an island compound, designed by the FBI to train profilers, Kilmer places a group of intelligent wannabees there to find a \"killer\" called the \"Puppeteer\". It's all supposed to be a simulated game..this changes when murders start to occur. Lots of tricks and traps are pulled by the puppeteer, and the film goes out of it's way to place LL Cool J(charismatic as always)as the chief suspect. Sure, the film will also put out there the main heroine as well, but this is perhaps far-fetched that anyone would believe she's anything more than a decoy by the screenplay to leave open everyone as suspect. Yes, I was eye-rolling at some of the elaborately staged death traps, but they are built much like SAW in surprising us. You never know what crazy kill will happen next and to whom. And, the always asked question..who is the exceptionally talented assassin? This, like SAW before it, is the ultimate screenwriter movie. I can envision the writer coming up with all kinds of nutty scenarios at his laptop, hammering out which ones work best. I felt the revealing of the killer and his motivations rubbish. I question the ability of anyone being able to set up and execute such sharply created death tricks. But, the film is a play of cat and mouse with the viewer. I will freely admit to being entertained, nothing more or less than that. Nothing new but entertaining; To be honest, I wasn't expecting much when I sat down to watch Mindhunters, but I found myself pleasantly surprised. Is the film perfect? No, the basic idea has been done to death and there are some scenes that don't hold much surprise, while some of the dialogue and characterisation is on the clichéd side and there are two performances that didn't quite work, LL Cool J, who is better as a rapper than as an actor here he tries to be too cool and comes across as annoying, and Patricia Velasquez, whose performance is sexy but very laboured. That said, Val Kilmer's character is the most interesting and he is quite charismatic in the time he has, Kathryn Morris is tolerable, Christian Slater is okay and Johnny Lee Miller is reliably good as he always is. The story while basically not the most original film on the planet, is tense, mysterious and atmospheric, the dialogue that is not clichéd is entertaining, the film is decently paced and moves at a cracking pace, the solution is interesting and plausible and the photography, editing and lighting add very well to the atmosphere. In conclusion, I liked it, despite it not being more than it could've been. 7/10 Bethany Cox Eeny, meeny, miney, mo. Who's the next motherf***er to go?; This movie was a good surprise, since I was actually expecting a below average flick. The film doesn't really offer anything really new but it sure was entertaining, even if a lot of it was implausible, downright ridiculous and mindless at times like some critics seem to claim. The government send these so called brightest discoverers on a island for a simulation program to solve clues and prove how good they really are and enhance there skills. But it turns out a serial killer is among them that goes by the name of the puppeteer and is trying to take them down one at a time. This was tight and suspenseful thriller. But I found some scenarios to get a bit annoying, like when they make judgment calls on other people from just there observations at a glance and showing off who is more aware of one another was sort of entertaining but you lose respect for the character cause the way they go about it. And makes the profiler wannabes or FBI students seem like egotistic moron, plus they get a lot of there assumptions wrong. Which applies to the real world, but I started to not care as much for some of the characters. The premise seemed like some sort of reality game show, except this is actually a lot of fun to watch, especially cause the annoying contestants die. The bickering and argument got a bit tedious as well since the person they suspect just about always ends up dying, proving the person accused is not the killer. And even when they argue they don't even try to listen to the other person's side of the story, which made all of them look unprofessional, plus they started losing there cool which leads them to make bad decisions. In fact a lot of the decisions some of the characters make in this movie is illogical at times, maybe it's the lack of character development or something but it just didn't make any sense. The most annoying character has to be Nicole Willis(Patricia Velasquez) and you start to wonder why she was chosen as one of the elites, cause she is just that idiotic and a huge hypocrite, plus nothing about her is attractive and her accent got irritating after a while. I liked how when the clues seems to have led to a conclusion, it ain't over and leads to something more, which was a pretty cool touch to the film. And I guess all the actors did what they were suppose to do, but Val Kilmer stood out the most. As a matter of fact he would have played Albert Wesker in the \"Resident Evil\" movies quite well. The one liners were very cheesy, but somewhat amusing like the rest of the film. I really liked the atmosphere of how anyone could die and how the killer uses each victims weaknesses against them. This is a fast paced thrill ride, that I had a good time with. So definitely worth checking out, even if it's for just one viewing. 7.6/10   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                        I liked it!; I have to say that this film was simpa. Plot is set in a hospital in Paris and shows all the horrors which doctors and patients have to live thru. Acting is very good and main characters show truly how life of a doctor in the hospital in France can be hard and complicated. It also shows well suffering of the patients and what their families have to live thru when mistakes are made by the doctors. If you are a fan of the European cinematography and want to see how life in every day France looks like I recommend that you see this film. Otherwise you will not miss too much by not watching it. Hospital Corners; If it's tough being a cowboy in Rochdale it's not that much easier being an intern in a French hospital, a sentiment which pretty much comprises the message of Hippocrate. Vincent Lacoste - and no, he doesn't sport crocodile shoes - is one such intern and we join him on his first day at a hospital where his father, Jacques Gamblin, is head honcho. Gamblin in fact is the only 'name' in the cast and certainly the only name that may be recognisable to audiences outside France so it is ironic that his total screen time amounts to something like twenty minutes every one of which he could have phoned in. Within what appear to be minutes of his arrival Lacoste decides a patient would require an ECG only to be told that the relevant equipment is broken and has been for months. Inevitably the patient dies and Lacoste is encouraged by colleagues not least his own father, to state that an ECG was performed and showed negative and again inevitably this returns to haunt him. He befriends an Algerian intern, a full doctor in his own country, who is also tailor-made for the scapegoat role when one is needed. This, in general, is the tone of a fine if mostly unremarkable film. French Doctor In the House  nearly; Benjamin (Vincent Lacoste) has just started at the Paris hospital where his papa works and he is convinced he is going to be a model doctor. However; he soon finds out that theory is often easier than practice. He also encounters an Algerian doctor Abdel (Reda Kateb  'A Prophet') who is among the legions of foreign doctors who have to doubly prove themselves in the French medical system. They get up to the usual shenanigans and also like to party  but the realities of cutbacks and a hospital administrator poached from Amazon (!) starts to make doing their job too difficult. Now this is supposed to be a comedy  and it was amusing in places but far from being actually laugh out loud. The acting is all fine, and the stories were very good too  I like the fact they all watch 'House'. However this is just a nice film and not one that is going to rock your world  that said I still enjoyed it. If you are a Francophile or like a medical drama then I am sure you will appreciate this Gallic offering. A superb drama; I like this movie speaking of the hard daily burden of doctors in a big hospital. A poignant drama with tremendous performances. Reda Kaleb is here outstanding, as a Young Algerian doctor who fights like a dog to apply his own rules. Like this one to help a near death old woman not to suffer anymore. See what I mean? It is not a indictment for euthanasia, as was for instance MILLION DOLLAR BABY, but only a gripping story, sometimes very hard to Watch. His character is awesome. A true hero, who doesn't hesitate to sacrifice himself for his ideas. Only the last two minutes are a bit run of the mill. But for the rest, don't hesitate. A realistic approach to medicine; Hiporcrates is a French film that revolves around a young intern, Benjamin and his discovery of life as a doctor, as he begins to recognize negligence and pain in his own surroundings. The relationships among the characters are often tender, but never stop being conscious and logical. With a realistic and low-key dialogue (and very subtle humour), beautifully constructed and believable characters, Hipocrates manages brake with the godly-like portrayal of doctors to make a smart film that acknowledges an often neglected and ignored issue as the medical situation and the treatment of human pain.   \n",

       "      <td>Very French; Valehtelija (1981) Valehtelija is an enjoyable pastiche of Breathless and other French New Wave films in which Aki Kaurismaki plays Ville Alfa, a young man with exceptional lying skills and a way with words. He treats people - his girlfriend and family members - badly and is extremely selfish. I found him both funny and sad. Thanks to the clever writing and direction, the movie is quite successful in making Helsinki feel like Paris of the 60s. Ville Alfa's friends are intellectuals who are talking about literature and just hanging out, taking it easy. They bring some nice humor to their scenes. A Nordic recognition to French cinema; I remember reading from a movie preview that after Valehtelija was premiered at the Tampere film festival in 1981, \"everyone there knew, that it was something significant, and that it was the start for something big\". Well it sure was. It was the beginning of a new era in Finnish film making. Kaurismäki brothers (especially Aki) have achieved a status of national icons in Finnish film making over the past years, and not for in vain. Valehtelija is still more than just a milestone in Finnish history. it's a brilliant picture. It's funny, skillfully filmed, and the dialogue is Aki at his best. The story is about a pathological liar, who's circle of friends contains of sad young men who think they're some kind intelligentsia. The liar \"Ville Alfa\" played by Aki Kaurismäki is in deep self-deception and thinks very high of himself as a misunderstood artist. Along the way most of his friends discover the reality behind his mysterious and exciting emotional shell, and time to time Ville is having some tough times believing in it even himself. Aki is known to be a fan of French cinema, and it can be seen on Valehtelija also. It's not just the style of movie-making, but the whole movie is clearly a loose rewrite of Jean Eustache's La maman et la putain (The mother and the whore), it has the same theme, the dialogue is done in a very similar way, and the main character is conspicuously similar with Ville Alfa. Although Valehtelija is a lot better. La maman et la putain lasts 220 minutes and Valehtelija lasts only 53 minutes, and it still has managed to get a lot more from the same subject. Aki later made another picture in 1992 - La Vie de bohème (Bohemian life) which is also based on the same self deception and pathological lying- theme, but it's even better than Valehtelija. It also comes clear that it's no secret that Aki was inspired by Jean Eustache, since Jean-Pierre Léaud, whom was the main part actor in La maman et la putain, is in the cast of La Vie de bohème. If you have seen any of these tree films mentioned above, or if they even have caught your interest, I strongly suggest you to watch them all, or at least Valehtelija and La Vie de bohème. They are a great combination of poetic French- and melancholic Finnish storytelling.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Unique one time partnership; For those looking for the magic of Laurel and Hardy, \"Zenobia\" offers an alternative that occurred because of Laurel's contract negotiations. Made the same year as \"Gone With The Wind\", Zenobia takes place in a time before the Civil War, where a small Southern plantation town at peace, is disrupted when the excitable traveling promoter (Harry Langdon), seeks aid for his ailing partner. A beloved country doctor (Oliver Hardy) is surprised and resists, but is coerced into treating a fully grown elephant for a terrible condition. Proving that a good deed never goes unpunished for Hardy, the patient, attempting to say 'thanks', relentlessly follows the good doctor and there is no place to hide, not even a formal social gathering. With the town in an uproar and his wife (Billie Burke) embarrassed at the spectacle, Dr Tibbetts is the focus of laughter, ridicule and a lawsuit. Twelve year old Philip Hurlic turns in a memorable performance that needs to be seen in the context of today. Langdon is little known by most and seems very much like Buster Keaton, but just a bit more shy. Although, Langdon is not as appreciated for his works as Stan and Ollie, his touching performance in \"Tramp, Tramp, Tramp!\" when he meets Joan Crawford, the girl of his dreams, face to face for the first time is something to behold. If you can look past Laurel's absence in this rare partnership, Zenobia will have you laughing at a moment in time when fate put two funny men and an elephant on a collision course. On such paths they prove there is just no dignified way to get around a loving elephant. I think Zenobia is a great movie despite the fact that Stan Laurel is absent.; I have seen Zenobia several times and yes, while it is not standard L&amp;H, it does show that comedy teams can work separately. I found Mr. Hardy to be an excellent actor in this character part and if I remember it also gave Mr. Hardy the opportunity to show off his excellent singing voice. In my book, Zenobia, stands apart for the routine L&amp;H movies and it should be treated in that manner.People who think that comedy teams should only appear as comedy teams are all wrong. Take Abbott and Costgello. I have seen movies in which they did not work as a team and were great. Another A&amp;C movie in which they were teamed, but not together, instead playing separate roles was equally good, where Lou played a Revolutionary War ghost and Abbott played a 20th century mortal. Take Martin and Lewis, everyone said they were finished when they broke up. Not so. They each went on to great careers. Stiller and Meara were great together as a radio and stage team and while still married, they now have separate careers. So folks, just because Stan Laurel is not scratching his head while standing next to the tie fluttering Norville Oliver Hardy, I still think Zenobia showed off Hardy's ability not to have to depend on Laurel. An amiable time-passer; While this certainly isn't a great movie and is in many ways pretty forgettable, it is a decent time-passer and worth seeing from a historic sense. This is the only film that Oliver Hardy starred in without Stan Laurel since they became a team in the late 1920s. However, when Laurel's contract expired he refuses to re-sign as he and Hardy (who was still under contract) wanted to explore other career options other than to continue with Hal Roach Studios. So, Roach decided to try pairing Hardy with a new partner--hoping he and Hardy would catch on and Hardy would soon re-sign with the studio. However, the film lacks the balance of a true Laural and Hardy film, as Hardy is definitely in the leading role. And, fortunately, Hardy does a pretty good job as the kindly doctor who is befriended by an elephant and he's able to carry this amiable film. Additionally, the movie is very interesting because in a supporting role (one that could have been played by Stan Laurel) was the silent film comedian, Harry Langdon. As there are few of his films still in existence, this is one of the rare chances you'll get to see,...as well as hear him. The story itself is pretty silly but handled so well, you probably will forgive this. Despite being a story about an Elephant that falls in love with Hardy, about the only thing you may not like about the film is Stepin Fetchit--the horribly stereotyped Black actor who made a career out of playing some who is dumb and lazy. It's quite a contrast to the role played by Philip Hurlic as 'Zeke'--a smart, precocious and cute Black child. At least there were contrasts, as most of Fetchit's earlier roles provided nothing to balance the negative image. Oliver Hardy solo movie; I have read the post before mine about this movie. Much I do agree with, but I wish to comment a bit more in defense of this movie. At the time, Hal Roach had a contract dispute with Stan. In short, Stan was offered more money then Oliver, and Stan said either pay us equal, or you don't have us anymore. That loyalty is amazing in any era. This movie was suppose to be for the both of them, but had to be re-written for just Oliver. Yes, the movie's writing suffers in many places, as it gets to be too silly, and even racist. However, the actual acting of Oliver, and Billie are truly wonderful, even if their lines were not. I view this movie as a rare treat, a historical footnote in the years of Laurel and Hardy. No, not a classic, nor anywhere near one, but entertaining? Yes. One can not compare this with any Laurel and Hardy movie. That would be unfair. They never knew if they would work together ever again at this point. True, at times I thought the concept of this movie was childish, but in an innocent entertaining way. As if to say we know it is silly, but it is just a silly movie. So no huge amount of thumbs up for this movie, but a nice treat for hardcore Laurel and Hardy fans. I will say though, thank God they got back together again! Ha! Two movies like this would have been a bit much to take Ha! An elephant never forgets; Oliver Hardy shines as a small town doctor in this amusing comedy set in the Old South. After tending to an ailing elephant Hardy can't get rid of the beast since she is so appreciative and an elephant never forgets. It's a fun path as Zenobia follows the portly doctor just about everywhere he goes. This is one of the few times that Hardy appeared in a film without his partner Stan Laurel however he handles it quite well. Co-starring are Jean Parker, James Ellison, Alice Brady, Billie Burke as the doctors befuddled wife and the ever dependable Hattie McDaniel. It's available on VSH folks. Love Pachyderm Style; For those wondering what Oliver Hardy was doing in a film without Stan Laurel, we have to remember that Hal Roach created the team back in silent days when he had these two comedians both signed to contracts with him. Their contracts were negotiated separately unlike Abbott and Costello or the Ritz Brothers, etc. So with Ollie signed with studio again and Stan balking at terms, Hal Roach decided to pair Hardy with Harry Langdon who was trying to recapture the stardom he enjoyed in the silent era. Ollie is a country doctor in post Civil War Mississippi who lives with wife Billie Burke and daughter Jean Parker in genteel poverty. James Ellison, late of the Hopalong Cassidy series, wants her hand in marriage, but his mother Alice Brady forbids it as Jean's parents are just not her sort. Nevertheless Ollie and Billie try to help Jean with her romance, but Ollie gets himself entangled with traveling medicine show man Harry Langdon and his performing elephant Zenobia. When the pachyderm becomes ill, Ollie effects a cure and the beast's gratitude makes his life miserable. Though they were advertised as a team, Langdon and Hardy are not a team really in this film, though their scenes with Zenobia are pretty funny. They're like Abbott and Costello in The Time Of Their Lives, a comedy team in two separate roles in which they only interact occasionally. Actually Burke and Brady, a couple of veteran Broadway performers, have some scenes together and they're pretty good in and of themselves. Getting Alice Brady and Billie Burke was a casting coup of sorts for Hal Roach. Look at the rest of his cast which he got from the major studios, if he was to have a new comedy team, they would be launched properly. Of course Stan Laurel came to terms and Langdon and Hardy were no more. But Zenobia is a film filled with gentle humor and some good comic situations. Elephants Never Forget; This unusual title is familiar to most cinephiles as Oliver Hardy's one starring vehicle of the sound era without Stan Laurel; and aided by an excellent supporting cast he carries the film extremely well. Playing the beloved local doctor of the fictitious town of Carterville, Mississippi in 1870, the Southern setting well suits him, and provides him with a context in which to exhibit the same Southern courtliness without being the pompous buffoon he usually was when teamed with Stan Laurel. He gives a performance of grace and charm, even dancing a few steps with spouse Billie Burke, and shows a concern for the underdog that extends to the little black kid played by Philip Hurlic that is reasonably lacking in condescension for 1939, let alone 1870. While it doesn't even attempt to be as funny as Hardy's work with Laurel, the film is however characterised by the charm and lack of sentimentality which remain one the principal reasons that Laurel &amp; Hardy's work has worn so well to this day compared to that of Chaplin. When you see Step'in Fetchit billed with his name 'humorously' spelled thus in the credits you fear the worst, although in the film that follows his mistress Billie Burke is actually dafter than he is. Hardy's comments about Southern segregation are later underlined without labouring the point by a fleeting shot of Hurlic, Fetchit &amp; Hattie McDaniel watching the trial through the courthouse window rather than from the public gallery. This film is often spoken of as an ersatz Laurel &amp; Hardy film with Harry Langdon filling in for Laurel, but Langdon's is really only a supporting role, although he acquits himself well, the old gestures from his silent films are still there, and it's interesting to both see and hear Langdon for once. Both he and Hardy look remarkably comfortable around Miss Zenobia, who plays the title role. Goodbye Laurel, Hello, Stepin!; Zenobia (1939) stars Oliver Hardy and Harry Langdon. Stan Laurel's contract with producer Hal Roach had expired and Stan refused to renew the contract unless Roach agreed to increase Hardy's salary to the same figure as Stan's. Roach refused on the grounds that Hardy's box office lure was not as powerful as Stan's, and to prove his point he cast Oliver as the lead in Zenobia. The movie was not a success. In fact, it actually lost money when first exhibited, and in a desperate move to bolster its appeal, the title was changed to Elephants Never Forget. That didn't work either. The movie was lucky to find a niche at New York's newsreel theatre, The Globe, on May 14, 1939, where it actually lasted the whole week before being replaced by Columbia's Chester Morris \"B\", Blind Alley. (I wouldn't mind seeing that one. It was directed by Charles Vidor). Anyway, even with the best will in the world, Zenobia is a chore to sit through. Furthermore, it boasts Stepin Fetchit in its roll-up of support players. I'll admit that Mr. Fetchit is only half as obnoxious in some movies, but in this one, Stepin takes up a great deal of the footage with his full, nauseating zombie treatment, so that further reduces Zenobia to a one-joke story that  despite the clumsy efforts of Hardy and Langdon  was neither particularly funny to begin with nor amusingly developed, Funny but....; The racism of the movie outweighs the humor. No wonder this was never on TV when I was a kid. At one point, Hardy lectures a 10 year old black kid because he doesn't understand why he was not invited to white parties. The gist of the response is basically we are \"equal\" but separate. I don't go to black parties so why should you want to go to white ones. Go down to my office and look at the stuff there and learn about this, once you understand, I will give you a quarter. That scene is so painful to watch...and embarrassing. Look at it as a piece of history but those type of scenes kill the movie. There are a lot of these types of scenes in the movies from the 30s but I have never seen one that thought that they needed to answer this young boy's question. Unfortunately, it was never...well...someday, things will be different. We feel that we can proclaim with reasonable certainty that ZENOBIA is \"The Leading Pachydermal Comedy of the 1930's!\" ( Also it's the only one!); IT HAS LONG been conventional wisdom that, \"Children and Dogs bring people together. The old proverb had adapted itself quite handily to the motion picture business long, long ago. W.C. Fields, for example, was a leading exponent of this belief; although his creed concentrated much more on the human portion of the statement. WHILE DOGS MAY well reign supreme in the four-legged category, most any animal has at least a portion of this screen magic. Throughout motion picture, there has been a veritable menagerie of creatures, great and small, who have shared the spotlight with their partners of the species homo sapiens sapiens. In many an instant, they stole many a scene; if, indeed, the entire picture. RATHER THAN HAVING humans competing with Dogs (Lassie, Benji, Yukon King, Rinty, etc.), or a Chimp (Cheetah, Zippy, J. Fred Muggs) or a Fish (Flipper*, Mr. Limpet), we have an elephant (Zenobia) in an eternal triangle with her owner (Harry Langdon) and the kindly town Doctor (Oliver Hardy). The humor is broad and varied. It is quite different;so, please don't expect this to be a Laurel &amp; Hardy comedy; you see, Schultz, SONS OF THE DESERT it's not! IT WOULD SEEM that at this point in film history, being Anno Domini MCMXXXIX (that's 1939 A.D.), that there was a deluge of news and interest in anything and everything which even remotely related to the American Civil War was in. Although there is no specific date given in the picture, it would seem to be Ante-Bellum, that's Latin for \"before the War.\" The costuming and situation with the Black Actors (Hattie McDaniel, Lincoln Perry) would seem to suggest neither Wartime nor the Reconstruction. THERE IS ALSO a speech by Oliver Hardy to the young boy about how matters concerning Whites have nothing to do with Black Folks and the concerns of Black People aren't any business of Whites. We concluded that this is sort of a disclaimer for Hal Roach Studios in any historical matters that might arise; such as had been the case of the D.W. Griffith epic silent, BIRTH OF A NATION. (This may sound silly today, but one must view things through the eyes of those in that period; as well as through contemporary lenses.) WITH RESPECT TO the film itself, it is quite amusing. Whereas we had previously said that it was no L&amp;H Comedy, it did strike several chords wit its audience. It was a fine showcase to the versatility of Mr. Hardy, who demonstrated that he was truly an actor; with \"Ollie\" being his most successful character. IN THE CASE of Oliver's co-star, Mr. Harry Langdon, it was a true tour de force; for he did a fine job of bringing a somewhat updated version of his \"Adult Baby\" persona from his Silent Screen days, when his name was at one time mentioned in the same breath with those of Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd. FOLLOWING HIS APPEARANCE in ZENOBIA, he returned to work as a behind the scenes gag man and to making two reelers for Roach and Columbia; all of which were okay, but mediocre shorts and surely a far cry from his salad days at Sennett and First National. TAKING THE TIME to stop and view the film, which was known as ELEPHANTS NEVER FORGET in the U.K. will not be totally wasted time. You will most probably enjoy it a lot more than you would have thought. We certainly did. NOTE * Alright, we know Flipper was a Dolfin, and hence a warm-blooded, live bearing MAMMAL!! Zenobia: Significant Symbol of Bigotry or Just an Elephant?; It is real cool the way this simple and seemingly silly movie has a big story to tell about bigotry and slavery and not just the obvious retrenches to the declaration of independence and \"black pills\" and \"red pills\". I wonder how many people who saw Zenobia in 1939 got the hidden messages subtle and obvious. Everyone reviewing Zenobia here in IMDb may have missed or did not mention an underling theme in the symbol represented by Zenobia the \"elephant\" that is big and always present like an elephant. Did anyone guess that maybe Zenobia represented a symbol of ",
       ".(you put your own word here about bigotry)? This is a great movie for using humorous subtleness to expose race, bigotry and prejudice at a time (1939) when people did not want to hear about race problems. It seems no coincidence that the most prejudice state Mississippi was chosen for the location and not Georgia or any other southern state. One sees the film with the view to the more subtle inferences to race with a Big Elephant named Zenobia. You may have a whole new perspective on the film and what appears to be \"poorly written\", \"little real humour (humor)\", \"racist performance of Stepin Fetchit\", etc. is really a great presentation. Considering the times (1939), and the subtle symbol of \"Zenobia\", then this movie is a down right genius of production! I think Stepin Fetchit knew what the movie meant and was a lot smarter than people think. Rich and Poor, Black and White and an ELEPHANT in the room.; It is a fun movie with many fun joyful moments. It's about 2 families one rich, one poor coming to grips with the rich boy falling in love with the poor girl. I will say for being poor she lives in a grand house and wears really nice clothes. I loved each actor in their role. I love old movies that dare to address what is usually whispered. Racism is boldly addressed when the black child asks the white doctor why he can't go to the white parties. The Doc is colorblind and only sees people as people because of his love of the Declaration of Independence. The young black child ends up stirring not only the movie actors but the movie's audience. I had no idea who the actors were, just recognizing them as the movie progressed. I was watching in the lunch room and at the end of the movie 5 people had sat down with me enjoying the movie. I really enjoyed this film and will be adding it to my collection. Nice Laughs; Zenobia (1939) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Oliver Hardy plays a country doctor's whose life gets turned upside down when his daughter is about to marry into a rich family that doesn't want her. To make matters worse, the doctor is asked by a circus man (Harry Langdon) to look at his sick elephant. The doctor cures the creature but then the elephant refuses to leave his side. This was Hardy's first and only starring role without Stan Laurel but the screenplay really seems like it was originally meant for the two. Langdon, a silent screen star, fills in for Laurel and one can't help but think the duo could have made this film together but didn't for whatever reasons. The film takes place during the Old South and features a lot more than just laughs as the doctor always talks about he Declaration of Independence and how important that is to him. The battles between rich and poor as well as black and white are dealt with in a pretty honest manor considering the type of film this is. There's one sequence where a black boy asks Hardy if he'll ever be white so that he will be able to do more things. The response Hardy gives him makes for some good drama but it's also interesting in what's said. I was surprised at how honest they looked at the racial tensions but some of them are nearly thrown to the side with Step'n Fetchit playing his normal slow slave character. He's certainly very good at what he does but the performance does go against some of the speeches in the film. Hardy proves that he could carry a movie on his own and delivers many laughs including a very funny sequence where he tells Langdon that he isn't an elephant. Langdon's comeback is great and he also manages to do his part quite well and add plenty of laughs. I didn't care too much for any of the other supporting performances as I found them very annoying due to how they were written in the screenplay. This film certainly isn't a masterpiece or even a classic but it makes for a mildly entertaining 70-minutes. Oliver Hardy Stars Solo; Oliver Hardy stars as a small-town doctor in Mississippi who hits on hard times when he insults the local rich woman (Alice Brady). Meanwhile his daughter (Jean Parker) is engaged to the rich woman's son (James Ellison). Brady will not have Parker as a daughter-in-law because the the family's low social standing. Hardy's wife (Billie Burke)invites everyone to dinner to try to smooth thing over. Disaster. When Hardy is summoned to come help someone who is sick, he races across town only to find that the patient is an elephant (Zenobia) in a traveling carnival. Zenobia's owner (silent comic great, Harry Langdon) helps Hardy figure out how to treat an elephant. Zenobia is so grateful, she falls in love with Hardy and refuses to leave his side. Langdon gets mad and sues Hardy (with the help of mean-spirited Brady). There is a good court room scene and the usual ending. The cast works well in this mild but pleasant comedy. Many will be disappointed by Langdon's standing in for Stan Laurel, but it's interesting to see Langdon in a talkie. Definitely a B film, but not without its good points. Hardy is very good in a comic role that allows him a little room to act. Burke and Brady are total pros, and Jean Parker is pretty and pleasing. Ellison is a blank. Hattie McDaniel plays the cook, J. Farrell McDonald is the judge, Olin Howland is the lawyer, Hobart Cavanaugh plays a patient, Philip Hurlic (as the kid) has a great scene, June Lang plays a rival, and Stepin Fetchit plays himself. William Bakewell can be spotted in a bit part. ZENOBIA (Gordon Douglas, 1939) **; I had always been interested in watching this curiosity (Oliver Hardy without Stan Laurel!) - however, it finally came about by way of a colorized and atrociously-dubbed version on Italian TV! I don't know if it was intended as such but, rather than Harry Langdon, the character that was made to fill Stan's shoes, as it were (complete with the Italian voice typically associated with him), was Billie Burke - playing Hardy's wife - but she came off as such an irritating dim-wit that I wanted to strangle her!! To make matters worse, with the story taking place in the Old South, we're treated to the unenviable comic relief of Stepin Fetchit (though his antics proved reasonably tolerable, under the circumstances). Hardy's character, then, isn't the pompous, bumbling and flustered one we'd come to love! Langdon, as the owner of a traveling medicine-show and a pachyderm, is okay (especially during his scenes in court - having learned his deposition by heart, every time he's asked to speak he starts from the very top!); this was only his second Talkie that I've watched - the first occurred only recently with HALLELUJAH, I'M A BUM (1933). Jean Parker and James Ellison provide bland romantic interest and the supporting cast also features Oscar winners Alice Brady and Hattie MacDaniel, but their stereotypical characters - snooty matriarch and black cook, respectively - add very little of substance to the proceedings! In the end, while the elephant's persistent and awkward devotion to doctor Hardy for having cured her (even disrupting a society party and following him into the court-room!) provides some undeniably charming moments, I think I'd still prefer Laurel &amp; Hardy's maligned vehicles of the 1940s over it... Elephantine; Plodding along clumsily through themes of race and class, 'Zenobia' is the movie equivalent of a television after school special that tries desperately to force feed its audience a plate of moral fiber for digestion. This morality feeding does not go down smoothly at all, even with a spoonful of humor provided by the antics of Oliver Hardy and company. Hardy is decent, but the humor in the film is never up to his standard and the preachings of the other plot lines is just incredibly lame. The irony of 'Zenobia' is that when it begins to preach, it comes of as comical, when it tries to be funny, it falls seriously flat. The problem I have in slamming this movie is that its heart seems to be in the right place, sort of. Besides, how can you hate an Oliver Hardy film? I spent most of my time laughing AT THE MOVIE. Hardy, a doctor by trade, explains race to his black child servant simply as being the difference between white pills and black pills. He mentions that the Declaration of Independence is made up of black, white, red and yellow pills. When Hardy asks the child if he understands, the child answers back, \"No, Suh\". What does Hardy mean? Is he saying that all pills are created equal? Hardy finally appeases the child's questions by bargaining a quarter to the child if he can memorize the Declaration of Independence. Well, that settles it. Now Hardy can go to the all white party where no colored people are allowed to attend. When Hardy gets to the party he is subjected to a bit of class-ism. Hardy squints a shade of disapproval, but is able to carry on happily enough until Zenobia the elephant crashes the party. Suddenly Hardy finds himself in a confusing lawsuit over the affections of an elephant or from an attempt to embarrass his daughter into not marrying into another family, or something, I'm not really sure. One thing is certain, this was the first film where the comedy duo consisted of Oliver Hardy being the skinny one. Pretty dire stuff. Stay away if you like comedy. A pleasant curio!; Oliver Hardy exhibits his talent as a character actor in this well-cast Roach feature. People often make the mistake of expecting a Laurel &amp; Hardy film, which isn't really fair. This is a pleasant diversion, filled with rich characters, including Langdon in perfect form as the owner of a sick elephant. Ollie should stick with Stan; I am a great lover of the Laurel and Hardy movies and so it was with some excitement that I was finally able to rent one of only two movies that Oliver Hardy made without Stan Laurel since their teamwork began (the other, Fighting Kentuckian, also stars another one of my favorite actors, John Wayne, and I enjoyed that one quite a bit).  This however was a huge disappointment.  It seemed to be Hal Roach's attempt at a prestige piece but it belies its poor roots.  The story of a country doctor in the 19th century who treats an carnival elephant named Zenobia and then can't lose the elephant and its affections is poorly written, with little real humour. The performances are lackluster, with the exception of Billie Burke as Ollie's long suffering yet dim-witted wife.  Her performance injects each scene she is in with the kind of manic craziness the rest of the movie aspires to but can't deliver.  Another major bone of contention was the hideously racist performance of Stepin Fetchit as the servant, Zero.  Ollie's later speech on equality can not even begin to make up for this truly offensive addition to an already poor movie.  An early L&amp;H sound short, Laughing Gravy, was included on the tape and showed us what Ollie could really do when given the proper material with Stan and I laughed out loud many times.  I only wish that Zenobia could have made me do that just once. Zenobia is a mostly entertaining Oliver Hardy vehicle with Harry Langdon in fine support; Since this is Black History Month and I'm reviewing African-Americans on film in mostly chronological order, let's start my review of Zenobia by mentioning three of the players: Stepin Fetchit, Hattie McDaniel, and Philip Hurlic. Stepin (spelled Step'n in the credits) is Zero-the butler. He's quite funny with his talking under his breath about his thoughts every time he gets ordered. Having seen quite a few of his performances now, I have tolerated his presence a bit more because of some of the subtle brightness he brings to his parts. Hattie (whose last name has an 's' added in the credits) brings the same commanding presence that I last saw in Show Boat, which I just watched this morning. And Philip, the kid here that I just saw in The Green Pastures, as Zeke proves to be the most intelligent one in the movie when he recites The Declaration of Independence with the reward being a quarter from Oliver Hardy's character of Dr. Tibbett. They all were fine performances here despite some of the stereotypes they're forced to play. Now, with Hardy briefly split from Stan Laurel (because of the latter's dispute with Hal Roach), he's the carrier of this movie and he does just fine especially in his scenes with Harry Langdon and an elephant, Zenobia, that Langdon-as Professor McCrackle-owns. Those scenes are the most \"Laurel and Hardy\"-like in the film. Also in fine form were Billie Burke as Hardy's wife, Bessie Tibbett, Olin Howard as Attorney Culpepper, and J. Farrell McDonald, another supporting player from my favorite movie-It's a Wonderful Life (he played the old man whose tree was hit by George Bailey's car), as the Judge. One other note: Jean Parker who plays Hardy's daughter Mary Tibbett here, would later in the year play his potential fiancée in The Flying Deuces which marked Laurel and Hardy's re-teaming. So on that note, I highly recommend Zenobia. Oh, and having just seen the Hall Johnson Choir in The Green Pastures, it's nice hearing them here too.</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                           Very French; Valehtelija (1981) Valehtelija is an enjoyable pastiche of Breathless and other French New Wave films in which Aki Kaurismaki plays Ville Alfa, a young man with exceptional lying skills and a way with words. He treats people - his girlfriend and family members - badly and is extremely selfish. I found him both funny and sad. Thanks to the clever writing and direction, the movie is quite successful in making Helsinki feel like Paris of the 60s. Ville Alfa's friends are intellectuals who are talking about literature and just hanging out, taking it easy. They bring some nice humor to their scenes. A Nordic recognition to French cinema; I remember reading from a movie preview that after Valehtelija was premiered at the Tampere film festival in 1981, \"everyone there knew, that it was something significant, and that it was the start for something big\". Well it sure was. It was the beginning of a new era in Finnish film making. Kaurismäki brothers (especially Aki) have achieved a status of national icons in Finnish film making over the past years, and not for in vain. Valehtelija is still more than just a milestone in Finnish history. it's a brilliant picture. It's funny, skillfully filmed, and the dialogue is Aki at his best. The story is about a pathological liar, who's circle of friends contains of sad young men who think they're some kind intelligentsia. The liar \"Ville Alfa\" played by Aki Kaurismäki is in deep self-deception and thinks very high of himself as a misunderstood artist. Along the way most of his friends discover the reality behind his mysterious and exciting emotional shell, and time to time Ville is having some tough times believing in it even himself. Aki is known to be a fan of French cinema, and it can be seen on Valehtelija also. It's not just the style of movie-making, but the whole movie is clearly a loose rewrite of Jean Eustache's La maman et la putain (The mother and the whore), it has the same theme, the dialogue is done in a very similar way, and the main character is conspicuously similar with Ville Alfa. Although Valehtelija is a lot better. La maman et la putain lasts 220 minutes and Valehtelija lasts only 53 minutes, and it still has managed to get a lot more from the same subject. Aki later made another picture in 1992 - La Vie de bohème (Bohemian life) which is also based on the same self deception and pathological lying- theme, but it's even better than Valehtelija. It also comes clear that it's no secret that Aki was inspired by Jean Eustache, since Jean-Pierre Léaud, whom was the main part actor in La maman et la putain, is in the cast of La Vie de bohème. If you have seen any of these tree films mentioned above, or if they even have caught your interest, I strongly suggest you to watch them all, or at least Valehtelija and La Vie de bohème. They are a great combination of poetic French- and melancholic Finnish storytelling.   \n",
       "1953  Unique one time partnership; For those looking for the magic of Laurel and Hardy, \"Zenobia\" offers an alternative that occurred because of Laurel's contract negotiations. Made the same year as \"Gone With The Wind\", Zenobia takes place in a time before the Civil War, where a small Southern plantation town at peace, is disrupted when the excitable traveling promoter (Harry Langdon), seeks aid for his ailing partner. A beloved country doctor (Oliver Hardy) is surprised and resists, but is coerced into treating a fully grown elephant for a terrible condition. Proving that a good deed never goes unpunished for Hardy, the patient, attempting to say 'thanks', relentlessly follows the good doctor and there is no place to hide, not even a formal social gathering. With the town in an uproar and his wife (Billie Burke) embarrassed at the spectacle, Dr Tibbetts is the focus of laughter, ridicule and a lawsuit. Twelve year old Philip Hurlic turns in a memorable performance that needs to be seen in the context of today. Langdon is little known by most and seems very much like Buster Keaton, but just a bit more shy. Although, Langdon is not as appreciated for his works as Stan and Ollie, his touching performance in \"Tramp, Tramp, Tramp!\" when he meets Joan Crawford, the girl of his dreams, face to face for the first time is something to behold. If you can look past Laurel's absence in this rare partnership, Zenobia will have you laughing at a moment in time when fate put two funny men and an elephant on a collision course. On such paths they prove there is just no dignified way to get around a loving elephant. I think Zenobia is a great movie despite the fact that Stan Laurel is absent.; I have seen Zenobia several times and yes, while it is not standard L&H, it does show that comedy teams can work separately. I found Mr. Hardy to be an excellent actor in this character part and if I remember it also gave Mr. Hardy the opportunity to show off his excellent singing voice. In my book, Zenobia, stands apart for the routine L&H movies and it should be treated in that manner.People who think that comedy teams should only appear as comedy teams are all wrong. Take Abbott and Costgello. I have seen movies in which they did not work as a team and were great. Another A&C movie in which they were teamed, but not together, instead playing separate roles was equally good, where Lou played a Revolutionary War ghost and Abbott played a 20th century mortal. Take Martin and Lewis, everyone said they were finished when they broke up. Not so. They each went on to great careers. Stiller and Meara were great together as a radio and stage team and while still married, they now have separate careers. So folks, just because Stan Laurel is not scratching his head while standing next to the tie fluttering Norville Oliver Hardy, I still think Zenobia showed off Hardy's ability not to have to depend on Laurel. An amiable time-passer; While this certainly isn't a great movie and is in many ways pretty forgettable, it is a decent time-passer and worth seeing from a historic sense. This is the only film that Oliver Hardy starred in without Stan Laurel since they became a team in the late 1920s. However, when Laurel's contract expired he refuses to re-sign as he and Hardy (who was still under contract) wanted to explore other career options other than to continue with Hal Roach Studios. So, Roach decided to try pairing Hardy with a new partner--hoping he and Hardy would catch on and Hardy would soon re-sign with the studio. However, the film lacks the balance of a true Laural and Hardy film, as Hardy is definitely in the leading role. And, fortunately, Hardy does a pretty good job as the kindly doctor who is befriended by an elephant and he's able to carry this amiable film. Additionally, the movie is very interesting because in a supporting role (one that could have been played by Stan Laurel) was the silent film comedian, Harry Langdon. As there are few of his films still in existence, this is one of the rare chances you'll get to see,...as well as hear him. The story itself is pretty silly but handled so well, you probably will forgive this. Despite being a story about an Elephant that falls in love with Hardy, about the only thing you may not like about the film is Stepin Fetchit--the horribly stereotyped Black actor who made a career out of playing some who is dumb and lazy. It's quite a contrast to the role played by Philip Hurlic as 'Zeke'--a smart, precocious and cute Black child. At least there were contrasts, as most of Fetchit's earlier roles provided nothing to balance the negative image. Oliver Hardy solo movie; I have read the post before mine about this movie. Much I do agree with, but I wish to comment a bit more in defense of this movie. At the time, Hal Roach had a contract dispute with Stan. In short, Stan was offered more money then Oliver, and Stan said either pay us equal, or you don't have us anymore. That loyalty is amazing in any era. This movie was suppose to be for the both of them, but had to be re-written for just Oliver. Yes, the movie's writing suffers in many places, as it gets to be too silly, and even racist. However, the actual acting of Oliver, and Billie are truly wonderful, even if their lines were not. I view this movie as a rare treat, a historical footnote in the years of Laurel and Hardy. No, not a classic, nor anywhere near one, but entertaining? Yes. One can not compare this with any Laurel and Hardy movie. That would be unfair. They never knew if they would work together ever again at this point. True, at times I thought the concept of this movie was childish, but in an innocent entertaining way. As if to say we know it is silly, but it is just a silly movie. So no huge amount of thumbs up for this movie, but a nice treat for hardcore Laurel and Hardy fans. I will say though, thank God they got back together again! Ha! Two movies like this would have been a bit much to take Ha! An elephant never forgets; Oliver Hardy shines as a small town doctor in this amusing comedy set in the Old South. After tending to an ailing elephant Hardy can't get rid of the beast since she is so appreciative and an elephant never forgets. It's a fun path as Zenobia follows the portly doctor just about everywhere he goes. This is one of the few times that Hardy appeared in a film without his partner Stan Laurel however he handles it quite well. Co-starring are Jean Parker, James Ellison, Alice Brady, Billie Burke as the doctors befuddled wife and the ever dependable Hattie McDaniel. It's available on VSH folks. Love Pachyderm Style; For those wondering what Oliver Hardy was doing in a film without Stan Laurel, we have to remember that Hal Roach created the team back in silent days when he had these two comedians both signed to contracts with him. Their contracts were negotiated separately unlike Abbott and Costello or the Ritz Brothers, etc. So with Ollie signed with studio again and Stan balking at terms, Hal Roach decided to pair Hardy with Harry Langdon who was trying to recapture the stardom he enjoyed in the silent era. Ollie is a country doctor in post Civil War Mississippi who lives with wife Billie Burke and daughter Jean Parker in genteel poverty. James Ellison, late of the Hopalong Cassidy series, wants her hand in marriage, but his mother Alice Brady forbids it as Jean's parents are just not her sort. Nevertheless Ollie and Billie try to help Jean with her romance, but Ollie gets himself entangled with traveling medicine show man Harry Langdon and his performing elephant Zenobia. When the pachyderm becomes ill, Ollie effects a cure and the beast's gratitude makes his life miserable. Though they were advertised as a team, Langdon and Hardy are not a team really in this film, though their scenes with Zenobia are pretty funny. They're like Abbott and Costello in The Time Of Their Lives, a comedy team in two separate roles in which they only interact occasionally. Actually Burke and Brady, a couple of veteran Broadway performers, have some scenes together and they're pretty good in and of themselves. Getting Alice Brady and Billie Burke was a casting coup of sorts for Hal Roach. Look at the rest of his cast which he got from the major studios, if he was to have a new comedy team, they would be launched properly. Of course Stan Laurel came to terms and Langdon and Hardy were no more. But Zenobia is a film filled with gentle humor and some good comic situations. Elephants Never Forget; This unusual title is familiar to most cinephiles as Oliver Hardy's one starring vehicle of the sound era without Stan Laurel; and aided by an excellent supporting cast he carries the film extremely well. Playing the beloved local doctor of the fictitious town of Carterville, Mississippi in 1870, the Southern setting well suits him, and provides him with a context in which to exhibit the same Southern courtliness without being the pompous buffoon he usually was when teamed with Stan Laurel. He gives a performance of grace and charm, even dancing a few steps with spouse Billie Burke, and shows a concern for the underdog that extends to the little black kid played by Philip Hurlic that is reasonably lacking in condescension for 1939, let alone 1870. While it doesn't even attempt to be as funny as Hardy's work with Laurel, the film is however characterised by the charm and lack of sentimentality which remain one the principal reasons that Laurel & Hardy's work has worn so well to this day compared to that of Chaplin. When you see Step'in Fetchit billed with his name 'humorously' spelled thus in the credits you fear the worst, although in the film that follows his mistress Billie Burke is actually dafter than he is. Hardy's comments about Southern segregation are later underlined without labouring the point by a fleeting shot of Hurlic, Fetchit & Hattie McDaniel watching the trial through the courthouse window rather than from the public gallery. This film is often spoken of as an ersatz Laurel & Hardy film with Harry Langdon filling in for Laurel, but Langdon's is really only a supporting role, although he acquits himself well, the old gestures from his silent films are still there, and it's interesting to both see and hear Langdon for once. Both he and Hardy look remarkably comfortable around Miss Zenobia, who plays the title role. Goodbye Laurel, Hello, Stepin!; Zenobia (1939) stars Oliver Hardy and Harry Langdon. Stan Laurel's contract with producer Hal Roach had expired and Stan refused to renew the contract unless Roach agreed to increase Hardy's salary to the same figure as Stan's. Roach refused on the grounds that Hardy's box office lure was not as powerful as Stan's, and to prove his point he cast Oliver as the lead in Zenobia. The movie was not a success. In fact, it actually lost money when first exhibited, and in a desperate move to bolster its appeal, the title was changed to Elephants Never Forget. That didn't work either. The movie was lucky to find a niche at New York's newsreel theatre, The Globe, on May 14, 1939, where it actually lasted the whole week before being replaced by Columbia's Chester Morris \"B\", Blind Alley. (I wouldn't mind seeing that one. It was directed by Charles Vidor). Anyway, even with the best will in the world, Zenobia is a chore to sit through. Furthermore, it boasts Stepin Fetchit in its roll-up of support players. I'll admit that Mr. Fetchit is only half as obnoxious in some movies, but in this one, Stepin takes up a great deal of the footage with his full, nauseating zombie treatment, so that further reduces Zenobia to a one-joke story that  despite the clumsy efforts of Hardy and Langdon  was neither particularly funny to begin with nor amusingly developed, Funny but....; The racism of the movie outweighs the humor. No wonder this was never on TV when I was a kid. At one point, Hardy lectures a 10 year old black kid because he doesn't understand why he was not invited to white parties. The gist of the response is basically we are \"equal\" but separate. I don't go to black parties so why should you want to go to white ones. Go down to my office and look at the stuff there and learn about this, once you understand, I will give you a quarter. That scene is so painful to watch...and embarrassing. Look at it as a piece of history but those type of scenes kill the movie. There are a lot of these types of scenes in the movies from the 30s but I have never seen one that thought that they needed to answer this young boy's question. Unfortunately, it was never...well...someday, things will be different. We feel that we can proclaim with reasonable certainty that ZENOBIA is \"The Leading Pachydermal Comedy of the 1930's!\" ( Also it's the only one!); IT HAS LONG been conventional wisdom that, \"Children and Dogs bring people together. The old proverb had adapted itself quite handily to the motion picture business long, long ago. W.C. Fields, for example, was a leading exponent of this belief; although his creed concentrated much more on the human portion of the statement. WHILE DOGS MAY well reign supreme in the four-legged category, most any animal has at least a portion of this screen magic. Throughout motion picture, there has been a veritable menagerie of creatures, great and small, who have shared the spotlight with their partners of the species homo sapiens sapiens. In many an instant, they stole many a scene; if, indeed, the entire picture. RATHER THAN HAVING humans competing with Dogs (Lassie, Benji, Yukon King, Rinty, etc.), or a Chimp (Cheetah, Zippy, J. Fred Muggs) or a Fish (Flipper*, Mr. Limpet), we have an elephant (Zenobia) in an eternal triangle with her owner (Harry Langdon) and the kindly town Doctor (Oliver Hardy). The humor is broad and varied. It is quite different;so, please don't expect this to be a Laurel & Hardy comedy; you see, Schultz, SONS OF THE DESERT it's not! IT WOULD SEEM that at this point in film history, being Anno Domini MCMXXXIX (that's 1939 A.D.), that there was a deluge of news and interest in anything and everything which even remotely related to the American Civil War was in. Although there is no specific date given in the picture, it would seem to be Ante-Bellum, that's Latin for \"before the War.\" The costuming and situation with the Black Actors (Hattie McDaniel, Lincoln Perry) would seem to suggest neither Wartime nor the Reconstruction. THERE IS ALSO a speech by Oliver Hardy to the young boy about how matters concerning Whites have nothing to do with Black Folks and the concerns of Black People aren't any business of Whites. We concluded that this is sort of a disclaimer for Hal Roach Studios in any historical matters that might arise; such as had been the case of the D.W. Griffith epic silent, BIRTH OF A NATION. (This may sound silly today, but one must view things through the eyes of those in that period; as well as through contemporary lenses.) WITH RESPECT TO the film itself, it is quite amusing. Whereas we had previously said that it was no L&H Comedy, it did strike several chords wit its audience. It was a fine showcase to the versatility of Mr. Hardy, who demonstrated that he was truly an actor; with \"Ollie\" being his most successful character. IN THE CASE of Oliver's co-star, Mr. Harry Langdon, it was a true tour de force; for he did a fine job of bringing a somewhat updated version of his \"Adult Baby\" persona from his Silent Screen days, when his name was at one time mentioned in the same breath with those of Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd. FOLLOWING HIS APPEARANCE in ZENOBIA, he returned to work as a behind the scenes gag man and to making two reelers for Roach and Columbia; all of which were okay, but mediocre shorts and surely a far cry from his salad days at Sennett and First National. TAKING THE TIME to stop and view the film, which was known as ELEPHANTS NEVER FORGET in the U.K. will not be totally wasted time. You will most probably enjoy it a lot more than you would have thought. We certainly did. NOTE * Alright, we know Flipper was a Dolfin, and hence a warm-blooded, live bearing MAMMAL!! Zenobia: Significant Symbol of Bigotry or Just an Elephant?; It is real cool the way this simple and seemingly silly movie has a big story to tell about bigotry and slavery and not just the obvious retrenches to the declaration of independence and \"black pills\" and \"red pills\". I wonder how many people who saw Zenobia in 1939 got the hidden messages subtle and obvious. Everyone reviewing Zenobia here in IMDb may have missed or did not mention an underling theme in the symbol represented by Zenobia the \"elephant\" that is big and always present like an elephant. Did anyone guess that maybe Zenobia represented a symbol of \n",
       ".(you put your own word here about bigotry)? This is a great movie for using humorous subtleness to expose race, bigotry and prejudice at a time (1939) when people did not want to hear about race problems. It seems no coincidence that the most prejudice state Mississippi was chosen for the location and not Georgia or any other southern state. One sees the film with the view to the more subtle inferences to race with a Big Elephant named Zenobia. You may have a whole new perspective on the film and what appears to be \"poorly written\", \"little real humour (humor)\", \"racist performance of Stepin Fetchit\", etc. is really a great presentation. Considering the times (1939), and the subtle symbol of \"Zenobia\", then this movie is a down right genius of production! I think Stepin Fetchit knew what the movie meant and was a lot smarter than people think. Rich and Poor, Black and White and an ELEPHANT in the room.; It is a fun movie with many fun joyful moments. It's about 2 families one rich, one poor coming to grips with the rich boy falling in love with the poor girl. I will say for being poor she lives in a grand house and wears really nice clothes. I loved each actor in their role. I love old movies that dare to address what is usually whispered. Racism is boldly addressed when the black child asks the white doctor why he can't go to the white parties. The Doc is colorblind and only sees people as people because of his love of the Declaration of Independence. The young black child ends up stirring not only the movie actors but the movie's audience. I had no idea who the actors were, just recognizing them as the movie progressed. I was watching in the lunch room and at the end of the movie 5 people had sat down with me enjoying the movie. I really enjoyed this film and will be adding it to my collection. Nice Laughs; Zenobia (1939) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Oliver Hardy plays a country doctor's whose life gets turned upside down when his daughter is about to marry into a rich family that doesn't want her. To make matters worse, the doctor is asked by a circus man (Harry Langdon) to look at his sick elephant. The doctor cures the creature but then the elephant refuses to leave his side. This was Hardy's first and only starring role without Stan Laurel but the screenplay really seems like it was originally meant for the two. Langdon, a silent screen star, fills in for Laurel and one can't help but think the duo could have made this film together but didn't for whatever reasons. The film takes place during the Old South and features a lot more than just laughs as the doctor always talks about he Declaration of Independence and how important that is to him. The battles between rich and poor as well as black and white are dealt with in a pretty honest manor considering the type of film this is. There's one sequence where a black boy asks Hardy if he'll ever be white so that he will be able to do more things. The response Hardy gives him makes for some good drama but it's also interesting in what's said. I was surprised at how honest they looked at the racial tensions but some of them are nearly thrown to the side with Step'n Fetchit playing his normal slow slave character. He's certainly very good at what he does but the performance does go against some of the speeches in the film. Hardy proves that he could carry a movie on his own and delivers many laughs including a very funny sequence where he tells Langdon that he isn't an elephant. Langdon's comeback is great and he also manages to do his part quite well and add plenty of laughs. I didn't care too much for any of the other supporting performances as I found them very annoying due to how they were written in the screenplay. This film certainly isn't a masterpiece or even a classic but it makes for a mildly entertaining 70-minutes. Oliver Hardy Stars Solo; Oliver Hardy stars as a small-town doctor in Mississippi who hits on hard times when he insults the local rich woman (Alice Brady). Meanwhile his daughter (Jean Parker) is engaged to the rich woman's son (James Ellison). Brady will not have Parker as a daughter-in-law because the the family's low social standing. Hardy's wife (Billie Burke)invites everyone to dinner to try to smooth thing over. Disaster. When Hardy is summoned to come help someone who is sick, he races across town only to find that the patient is an elephant (Zenobia) in a traveling carnival. Zenobia's owner (silent comic great, Harry Langdon) helps Hardy figure out how to treat an elephant. Zenobia is so grateful, she falls in love with Hardy and refuses to leave his side. Langdon gets mad and sues Hardy (with the help of mean-spirited Brady). There is a good court room scene and the usual ending. The cast works well in this mild but pleasant comedy. Many will be disappointed by Langdon's standing in for Stan Laurel, but it's interesting to see Langdon in a talkie. Definitely a B film, but not without its good points. Hardy is very good in a comic role that allows him a little room to act. Burke and Brady are total pros, and Jean Parker is pretty and pleasing. Ellison is a blank. Hattie McDaniel plays the cook, J. Farrell McDonald is the judge, Olin Howland is the lawyer, Hobart Cavanaugh plays a patient, Philip Hurlic (as the kid) has a great scene, June Lang plays a rival, and Stepin Fetchit plays himself. William Bakewell can be spotted in a bit part. ZENOBIA (Gordon Douglas, 1939) **; I had always been interested in watching this curiosity (Oliver Hardy without Stan Laurel!) - however, it finally came about by way of a colorized and atrociously-dubbed version on Italian TV! I don't know if it was intended as such but, rather than Harry Langdon, the character that was made to fill Stan's shoes, as it were (complete with the Italian voice typically associated with him), was Billie Burke - playing Hardy's wife - but she came off as such an irritating dim-wit that I wanted to strangle her!! To make matters worse, with the story taking place in the Old South, we're treated to the unenviable comic relief of Stepin Fetchit (though his antics proved reasonably tolerable, under the circumstances). Hardy's character, then, isn't the pompous, bumbling and flustered one we'd come to love! Langdon, as the owner of a traveling medicine-show and a pachyderm, is okay (especially during his scenes in court - having learned his deposition by heart, every time he's asked to speak he starts from the very top!); this was only his second Talkie that I've watched - the first occurred only recently with HALLELUJAH, I'M A BUM (1933). Jean Parker and James Ellison provide bland romantic interest and the supporting cast also features Oscar winners Alice Brady and Hattie MacDaniel, but their stereotypical characters - snooty matriarch and black cook, respectively - add very little of substance to the proceedings! In the end, while the elephant's persistent and awkward devotion to doctor Hardy for having cured her (even disrupting a society party and following him into the court-room!) provides some undeniably charming moments, I think I'd still prefer Laurel & Hardy's maligned vehicles of the 1940s over it... Elephantine; Plodding along clumsily through themes of race and class, 'Zenobia' is the movie equivalent of a television after school special that tries desperately to force feed its audience a plate of moral fiber for digestion. This morality feeding does not go down smoothly at all, even with a spoonful of humor provided by the antics of Oliver Hardy and company. Hardy is decent, but the humor in the film is never up to his standard and the preachings of the other plot lines is just incredibly lame. The irony of 'Zenobia' is that when it begins to preach, it comes of as comical, when it tries to be funny, it falls seriously flat. The problem I have in slamming this movie is that its heart seems to be in the right place, sort of. Besides, how can you hate an Oliver Hardy film? I spent most of my time laughing AT THE MOVIE. Hardy, a doctor by trade, explains race to his black child servant simply as being the difference between white pills and black pills. He mentions that the Declaration of Independence is made up of black, white, red and yellow pills. When Hardy asks the child if he understands, the child answers back, \"No, Suh\". What does Hardy mean? Is he saying that all pills are created equal? Hardy finally appeases the child's questions by bargaining a quarter to the child if he can memorize the Declaration of Independence. Well, that settles it. Now Hardy can go to the all white party where no colored people are allowed to attend. When Hardy gets to the party he is subjected to a bit of class-ism. Hardy squints a shade of disapproval, but is able to carry on happily enough until Zenobia the elephant crashes the party. Suddenly Hardy finds himself in a confusing lawsuit over the affections of an elephant or from an attempt to embarrass his daughter into not marrying into another family, or something, I'm not really sure. One thing is certain, this was the first film where the comedy duo consisted of Oliver Hardy being the skinny one. Pretty dire stuff. Stay away if you like comedy. A pleasant curio!; Oliver Hardy exhibits his talent as a character actor in this well-cast Roach feature. People often make the mistake of expecting a Laurel & Hardy film, which isn't really fair. This is a pleasant diversion, filled with rich characters, including Langdon in perfect form as the owner of a sick elephant. Ollie should stick with Stan; I am a great lover of the Laurel and Hardy movies and so it was with some excitement that I was finally able to rent one of only two movies that Oliver Hardy made without Stan Laurel since their teamwork began (the other, Fighting Kentuckian, also stars another one of my favorite actors, John Wayne, and I enjoyed that one quite a bit).  This however was a huge disappointment.  It seemed to be Hal Roach's attempt at a prestige piece but it belies its poor roots.  The story of a country doctor in the 19th century who treats an carnival elephant named Zenobia and then can't lose the elephant and its affections is poorly written, with little real humour. The performances are lackluster, with the exception of Billie Burke as Ollie's long suffering yet dim-witted wife.  Her performance injects each scene she is in with the kind of manic craziness the rest of the movie aspires to but can't deliver.  Another major bone of contention was the hideously racist performance of Stepin Fetchit as the servant, Zero.  Ollie's later speech on equality can not even begin to make up for this truly offensive addition to an already poor movie.  An early L&H sound short, Laughing Gravy, was included on the tape and showed us what Ollie could really do when given the proper material with Stan and I laughed out loud many times.  I only wish that Zenobia could have made me do that just once. Zenobia is a mostly entertaining Oliver Hardy vehicle with Harry Langdon in fine support; Since this is Black History Month and I'm reviewing African-Americans on film in mostly chronological order, let's start my review of Zenobia by mentioning three of the players: Stepin Fetchit, Hattie McDaniel, and Philip Hurlic. Stepin (spelled Step'n in the credits) is Zero-the butler. He's quite funny with his talking under his breath about his thoughts every time he gets ordered. Having seen quite a few of his performances now, I have tolerated his presence a bit more because of some of the subtle brightness he brings to his parts. Hattie (whose last name has an 's' added in the credits) brings the same commanding presence that I last saw in Show Boat, which I just watched this morning. And Philip, the kid here that I just saw in The Green Pastures, as Zeke proves to be the most intelligent one in the movie when he recites The Declaration of Independence with the reward being a quarter from Oliver Hardy's character of Dr. Tibbett. They all were fine performances here despite some of the stereotypes they're forced to play. Now, with Hardy briefly split from Stan Laurel (because of the latter's dispute with Hal Roach), he's the carrier of this movie and he does just fine especially in his scenes with Harry Langdon and an elephant, Zenobia, that Langdon-as Professor McCrackle-owns. Those scenes are the most \"Laurel and Hardy\"-like in the film. Also in fine form were Billie Burke as Hardy's wife, Bessie Tibbett, Olin Howard as Attorney Culpepper, and J. Farrell McDonald, another supporting player from my favorite movie-It's a Wonderful Life (he played the old man whose tree was hit by George Bailey's car), as the Judge. One other note: Jean Parker who plays Hardy's daughter Mary Tibbett here, would later in the year play his potential fiancée in The Flying Deuces which marked Laurel and Hardy's re-teaming. So on that note, I highly recommend Zenobia. Oh, and having just seen the Hall Johnson Choir in The Green Pastures, it's nice hearing them here too.   \n",

       "      <td>A prim little movie about role models, not real people; Elizabeth Bishop and her lover Lota de Macedo Soares must have had a pretty rocky relationshipLota ended up killing herselfbut you'd never know it from this very prim and proper biopic. The filmmakers tone down any elements that might disturb or challenge a target audience looking not for historical accuracy (or even good drama) but rather for inspiring role models. So Bishop and de Macedo Soares are shown as two strong, successful, and loving women who never let little problems like raging alcoholism, rampant ruling-class careerism, or crushing egomania get them down, until the final reel, when the whole movie comes off the rails. Consider the scene where Elizabeth bakes a birthday cake for her beloved, who stands her up. What happens when self-obsessed Lota finally shows up, only to find Elizabeth sleeping off a bender? \"Oh, you so hurt my feelings!\" \"Oh, so sorry, lovey-poo!\" A little kissy-kissy and it's all better. Sorry, I ain't buying it. How much closer to the truth (not to mention more interesting, and believable) if this scene had erupted in a screaming row a la \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", with the bitter, alcoholic American vs. the brazen Brazil nut. Alas, that would never do in a movie that's all about role models, not real people who really lived, and really ended up in mental hospitals and really committed suicide. When Lota does go certifiably crazy, this development seems to come from nowhere, since we haven't been shown a clue that anything was wrong with her or her perfect world. In real life, there's always a telltale breadcrumb trail leading to the nervous breakdown, but not in this movie. Lota just all of a sudden goes crazy. Go figure. Despite its glossy veneer, this is a deeply phony movie, a deceptive testament to a poet and an architect who both deserve to be more realistically portrayed on the screen. Maybe someday we'll see a competent documentary about these two women, their achievements, and their complex relationship, instead of this beautifully shot, polite and pandering excuse for a biopic. Elegant, rapturous throwback to old Hollywood; Reaching for the Moon is the kind of movie everyone hopes for but no one makes: a gay romance where \"gay romance\" is not the premise. Director Bruno Barreto focuses instead on how Elizabeth Bishop and Lota de Macedo Soares challenged and changed the world and each other in other ways, and that was absolutely the right choice - these women and their story are fascinating and make for top class entertainment. And it is entertaining. Considering the characters' issues and the story's ending it could have been drab, but the film is always lively and engaging. It flies by. Bishop takes herself very seriously, but Barreto maintains a sense of humor about it and makes fun of her just enough to keep her melodrama under control. An added bonus is that Miranda Otto gets to show off her underrated and underused comedic chops; one particular drunk scene is priceless. Glória Pires is dynamic and fiery as Lota but Otto is the real star, channeling Greta Garbo and Deborah Kerr in a gracefully commanding performance. She doesn't shy away from Bishop's spikiness, but her screen presence is so compelling that as much as we might be frustrated with her character, we can't take our eyes off her. Thanks to her constantly surprising performance, an eclectic ensemble cast, breathtaking visuals, and assured direction, Reaching for the Moon pulses with energy and is a breath of fresh air in an era of stuffy and bland biopics. Highlights: Shots of Rio de Janeiro that belong on postcards; a performance from Miranda Otto that would have won an Oscar in 1937; the assertion that some things are more important than whether a person is gay Verdict: Watch this with your parents instead of Blue Is the Warmest Color Gloria Pires as Lota De Macedo Soares...; Lovely. A story here that is not overshadowed by the relationships, politics, or agenda. It is, simply beautifully filmed, the beaches of Rio De Janeiro, the beautiful home Lota has deigned in part to accommodate her new lover, poet Elizabeth Bishop, completely played by Miranda Otto. Otto is at once restrained yet yearning, a Vassar graduate visiting her friend, who initially is puzzled (and indeed overwhelmed) by the beauty and passion of South America. She plays the American New England spinster type well, without a stereotype here. We can feel she wants, and NEEDS to break free from societal restraints. The filming of the rain forests, the owls at night, the visuals are incredible. Lota Soares was politically connected and designed the park near Carioca beach, the title infers, reaching for the moon has so may more connotations for each woman. What is most refreshing is the way this film is written, sensitive to the issues each woman experiences, it is an individual and a private journey. The actress portraying Carlotta Soares is affecting and sad, and Miranda Otto is quite believable as Bishop. The story is beautiful and sad, and the scenery of Brazil is not to be missed, simply beautiful, and beautifully filmed. 10/10 Genuíno; A gentle movie about relationships between three women. (Yes, I say three women as Mary lived with Bishop and Lota until the latter die.) And as every human relationship it is permeated with high, low and ... drama moments. When it comes to women it seems that directors never forget the drama. Blend together alcoholism, passion, money and drama and you have a genuine, feasible film, if based on true events. It feels that the characters lack in depth a little bit, but in this movie that was a good thing to me since the movie did not intend to replicate accurately the events (hence it is not possible to truly know what happened) . Therefore, t is up to the viewer to infer the finest nuances of those people based on the most general outlines shown in the film. It is a film to be savored and reflected as the years pass by within the plot. Philosophic analysis of poet Elizabeth Bishop's tragic love affair; However truthful to Elizabeth Bishop's tragic love affair with Brazilian architect Lota de Macedo Soares, Bruno Barreto's Reaching for the Moon is more generally engaged with the question: Is the examined life worth suffering? In this corner, Elizabeth (Miranda Otto), a wan, fragile, painfully timid and insecure poet who is mortified to hear one of her poems read aloud. In her insecurity and sense of powerlessness she is Woman. She dresses like an office manager's wife and wears her hair tight to her face. She compulsively observes and anatomizes her observations. Her life is at first nothing but her examining it. In contrast Lota has a large strong face, flowing long hair, a man's stocky build, and a man's aggressive stride and nature. She never questions herself or her impulses and she has the money not just to do what she wants but to get others to do so too. When she tells Elizabeth that she and her current amour, Elizabeth's college friend Mary (Tracy Middendorf), were just roommates, she admits Mary hasn't thought that. Probably Lota hasn't either. To draw Mary back into her fold as a friend Lota buys her a child. Lota is also creative, designing her sumptuous country estate and  after she helps friend Carlos (Marcello Airoldi) get elected Governor  designs and supervises the construction of a large public park, with towering standards to provide the magic of moonlight. But she's not a thinker, a meditator. She just acts. Not given to self-analysis, when the new guest Elizabeth arrives Lota leaps to wrong conclusions about her. Part of their antithesis is cultural. As Elizabeth drunkenly tells the Rio audience at her National Book Awards dinner, \"How can someone raised in the desert swim like a fish?\" The withdrawn Elizabeth doesn't understand the Brazilian exuberance, constant joy, and carefreeness, as they celebrate everything  even after the military coup has reduced their freedoms. But the contrast is mainly in the women's character. Still, though Lota is the first to express her love for Elizabeth  which the poet only reciprocates when Lota is asleep  in their first clinch Elizabeth assumes the ardent initiative. And despite -- or because of -- her relentless analyzing, Elizabeth is an alcoholic. With her deep pessimism and self-doubt, Elizabeth stumbles from success to success: the Pulitzer, the NBA, a slot in The New Yorker, the man Aldous Huxley's approval, a teaching gig at NYU. Her life examining works for her. But the ebullient, confident Lota breaks down at her first defeat: the new government corrupts her vision of the park, converting it into the cliché sterile paved soccer court. When Elizabeth asks if her going to New York caused Lota's depression, Mary clearly blames the ruin of her project. \"How could you think anyone could be that confident?\" For her part, Mary begins as a jejeune, non-thinking sort who doesn't expect her college friend to steal her lover. Dumped, Mary realizes she has \"no other option\" than to love Lota. But by film end she has learned to read people and situations. Motherhood may have taught her wariness. When she aborts Elizabeth's correspondence with Lota it is not out of selfish malice, but because she knows that Lota's losing Elizabeth again would destroy her. Events prove her right. Hence the poem Elizabeth ends too soon at the start of the film and rounds out at the end. \"The art of losing isn't hard to master.\" Not if you're a thinker. The frightened self- doubter sees enough loss to handle her own and not just thrive but survive. The robust willful woman who never paused to consider human vulnerability is defeated by her first loss  and kills herself at the second. This Is A Nice Film To Watch But Don't Expect Anything; the only main reason to watch this film &amp; like it you have to lower your expectations its a nice film it is a half fiction half biopic on real life American poet &amp; Brazilian architect there is a lesbian relationship shown here but no sex scene its just some kissing scene involved its too slow &amp; long for anyone to like it but i id. the plot:the story revolves around an American poet Elizabeth Bishop &amp; Lota De Macedo Soares during the building of Brazilian capital Brasilia around 1951 &amp; 1967. the cast;everyone did nice acting specially the leading ladies they tried there best like they have done this before everything was so easy for them. overall i liked it for what it was you will to just forget the critics they lie its a good film overall Reaching For The Moon 2013 deserves a one time watch at least my rating is 5/10. A melodramatic movie about a melodramatic situation; The Brazilian movie Flores Raras was shown in the United States with the title Reaching for the Moon (2013). It was directed by Bruno Barreto. The film is based on the life of the great American poet, Elizabeth Bishop (Miranda Otto). As the movie begins, Elizabeth is traveling in Brazil, and visits the estate of the famous architect Lota de Macedo Soares, played by Glória Pires. Lota is in a lesbian relationship with Bishop's college friend Mary (Tracy Middendorf). Despite Elizabeth's somewhat proper and restricted outlook, she accepts the love offered by Lota, even though this leaves Mary as the odd woman out. This act struck me as a shabby betrayal of an old friend, but, in the movie, it's treated as true love that makes such betrayal acceptable, if not inevitable. It doesn't hurt that Lota has an enormous estate, and enormous resources. As an architect, Lota is able to envision and then design a beautiful writer's studio for Elizabeth. The strong point of the movie is that it presents the writing of poetry as work. Elizabeth doesn't just close her eyes and wait until the poetic muse strikes her. She sits in the studio and pushes and pulls her poetry into shape. She's also not happy when she's interrupted during the creative process. This is the only film I can remember where creating a poem is shown as a process, and a delicate and difficult process at that. This idyllic existence is disrupted by Brazilian political events, into which Lota plunges. The remainder of the movie is devoted to how these events play out in the lives of Elizabeth and Lota. I don't know enough about the details of the coup, or of the lives of the film's principals, to know how accurately the film portrays them. This aspect of the movie is highly melodramatic, but the actual events were probably equally melodramatic. Certainly, the film holds your interest as the situation plays itself out to the end. We saw this movie on the large screen, where it will work better, especially in the scenes set on Lota's estate. However, it will work well enough on the small screen. It's not a great movie, but it's certainly good enough to repay you for finding and watching it. A deeply moving surprise of a film; I was sad to see this deeply moving, complex and intelligent story of the love between the award winning American poet Elizabeth Bishop and Brazilian architect Lota de Macedo Soares. so overlooked by U.S, audiences and critics. There are two outstanding performances by Miranda Otto as the outwardly shy and repressed alcoholic Bishop, and Gloria Pires as her opposite, an extroverted, highly emotional woman who coaxes Bishop out of her shell. Very nicely photographed, this reminded me of the best of the Merchant-Ivory films. It's not flashy. Indeed there's a quiet to it that is needed to off-set the melodramatic (even if based in truths) elements of these women's lives. But that doesn't keep it from packing a hell of an emotional punch, and in being bold enough to create characters we care for, but who are also deeply troubled and capable of making bad choices  just like in the real world of relationships we rarely see on screen. It was also nice to see a gay-themed love story that both acknowledged how difficult being homosexual was in the 1950s, while not becoming a film about that only. This is a film about a complex relationship between two highly creative and wounded souls who both save and damage each other. The fact that both are women is only a small part of the larger story. It's also one of the only films I've seen capture at least a taste of the struggle and loneliness of the act of writing. One of those little gems that deserves to be discovered by more people. A Must to see for all poets and fans of poetry; After the famous poet, Elizabeth Bishop, is greatly mentored by the star poet Robert Lowell, she, travels to Brazil, on her inheritance, has a love affair with a wealthy, female architect, who is in another love relationship with a former fellow student of Bishop's at Vassar College, called Mary. This threesome love relationship fails because each person involved in this relationship has a main flaw. Bishop's flaw is alcoholism. The architect's flaw is that she works herself to the point of mental insanity. Mary's flaw is jealousy. She does not want to share her architect girlfriend with Elizabeth Bishop, understandably. When watching the film in the cinema, yesterday, with the oranges and the red wine, I bought at the booth, all of us clapped at the end of the film, with wonderful actors, very beautiful scenery of Brazil as well as fantastic architecture, before tortillas, guacamole, nachos, corona and other Latin American snacks that were cheaply sold outside. This positive account begs the question, why I did not rate that film to be so good. Like many art-house or like many artsy films, Reaching for the Moon, we hardly know who most of the characters in this film truly are. There is just not enough character development in the film. We do not know what exactly makes Miss Bishop travel, why she loves this architect, why the architect loves her and why Mary loves this architect. We also do not know their views about belonging to a sexual minority. We do not know the reason for their flaws, such as the traumatic experiences that made Miss Bishop an alcoholic, what made the architect a workaholic, who does not talk to her family, and we know almost nothing about this third girl Mary, except that she went to University with Miss Bishop. We do not know the exact cause or even the nature of the architect's insanity. When she kills herself, she leaves no note, and nobody even asks or tries to find out why the hell she did it or if it was an accident. Like most films about poetry little attention is paid to the kind of Poetry Miss Bishop wrote, so that when she wins the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, in the film, you still end up leaving the movie theatre wondering why her poetry was considered to be so special, apart from the fact that she was rich, well educated and knew some of the greatest poets like Robert Lowell and Marian Moore. This film is full of paper Mache' characters, in which you hardly know who the people in the film are, despite the strong attempts of the actors in the film to act as well as possible, which made the film worth watching, especially as a poet and author myself, amongst other things. Gorgeous, real, richly evocative on many levels; Reaching for the Moon (2013) Wonderful! The story of the Brazilian years of the great North American poet, Elizabeth Bishop. There are so many beautiful aspects to the characters, their setting, and their relationships it's hard to know where to begin. And even better, on top of all this, is the historical recreation of the times, and the changing political climate of Brazil. It's touching and uplifting and tragic. The original title of this is \"Flores Raras\" because these were indeed rare people, and doing beautiful things. And yes, they were reaching for the moon but you might rather say they reached the moon. Succeeding at something is more than literally fulfilling. The plot has a slightly meandering, unfamiliar arc through the main events, and there are times when you think one thing and then suddenly another happens. Don't blame bad writing, but rather realize that this is how life is, and how it really was. Remember as well that these are artists of privilege at work, they have money and education and act with a kind of license and liberation that we all should feel. And so it's unpredictable. As a kind of true insight into the poetic process you might find few parallels in the movies. You learn their temperaments, and how circumstances make the artist and the poet come to their best. The intimate circumstances are about love, a really true deep love that grows between these two women. Their professional needs reinforce and conflict with their personal needs, but they make it work. The outside circumstances are hard to understand from 2014. Brazil was once a very different country, filled with far more freedom and sense of liberation. (This seems to be a direction that are pointed in again, though going through fits and starts.) But the world in post-War Brazil was one of possibility. It was a haven (not just for ex-Nazis) and a growing \"New World,\" but it was also stuffed with poverty (which the movie ignores), a legacy still at hand. And this is exciting stuff. The movie moves mostly through the confines of their big, gorgeous estate in the hills, but it also shows us the city, and the larger world. So Bishop and Lota de Macedo Soares, an important architect of the era. grow and suffer and see their world fall apart around them (Brazil fell under dictatorship in the mid 1960s). It's filmed with utter beauty, the acting is sharp and convincing, and the writing (not surprisingly) is fluid and tight. Great stuff. Involving, watchable, grown-up - sound like your kind of movie?; I enjoyed this story of a lengthy midlife love affair, \"based on\" (that is, \"not cemented to the known facts of\") real women of some mid-century renown. One, American poet Elizabeth Bishop, is quiet, slow to warm to strangers or share working drafts of her poems. See if Miranda Otto doesn't remind you of Deborah Kerr in her memorable 1940s and '50s roles (and clothes). In Brazil to visit an old college friend, Elizabeth meets Lota de Macedo Soares, a charismatic commander of attention and glamorously trousered architect. They become lovers and make their life in Brazil. All the characters, including a close male friend of Lota's and one of Elizabeth's, are revelations in the best sense: mature but unfinished adults, they meet their circumstances over nearly 20 years in ways not even they might be able to predict. Mark Twain said that fiction is obliged to meet our expectations but the truth isn't. Central Casting can provide \"types,\" but history offers people like nobody else, which is why you'll find discussions here and elsewhere complaining that these lesbians were not put through their proper lesbian plot paces! The drunks were sometimes sober! People got depressed without enough foreshadowing! Ignore all that. This is a good quiet story, mostly but not all sad, about people learning themselves as they go, living genuinely if not always bravely. And anyone who's ever dreamed of having a writer's sanctuary will fall rapturously in love with the al fresco study Lota builds for Elizabeth. Must be seen to be appreciated! Enthralling; I just finished watching this on Netflix streaming. I will be honest, I had not heard of either Elizabeth Bishop (not a poetry reader) or Lota de Macedo Soares (don't know that much about Brazilian history). What an explosion of a true story. I was memorized. Miranda Otto, who always delivers a great performance in everything that I've seen her in, was amazing. Her character was such a conflicted person and she came out doing it brilliantly! Now, for Gloria Pires, she was a force to be reckoned with. I can't say anymore than that. When she was on the screen, it was hard to NOT to look at her. Tracy Middendort was heart wrenching as the jilted lover. I could feel what she was going through because haven't we all had to do that at one time or another? Brava to all three leading ladies. Their performances were excellent and so true to life! many layers of pleasure; Reaching for the moon So happy I saw this at preview. To test a film we were made to wait one hour almost while they got an unlock code to the digital file! If that isn't a test I can't think of another. This film passed across this barrier with aplomb. Both actor do a commendable job. The location is magic, a valley of lush greenery just outside Rio Janeiro Brazil. The relationship depicted works with the strange sub plot of the other woman r remain and bringing up baby, quite bazaar when you think back. For me the greatest pleasure might be discovery of Elizabeth bishop poems. I feel very fortunate to have added these to my experience of human condition. Further test I will see this film again tomorrow, not 2 weeks since the first viewing. A most unusual thing for me, the relentless consumer of movie's. The things that will hold are the script the locations, the cinematography, and so the direction. To discover the gestation of this movie over what 20 years and the passion that held the project alive to it's realization on screen are a compliment to all involved.! It'd be hard not to enjoy this film and opened to a world ratified and rarely accessible. Intense &amp; Intelligent Drama; I found this film to be an intense and intelligent drama, which was well acted, scripted, and directed. Based on a true story, it centers on the lesbian relationship between acclaimed poet Elizabeth Bishop and Brazilian architect Lota de Macedo Soares, during the 1950's and 60's in Brazil. Both lead actresses are superb here, with Miranda Otto, in perhaps her best performance to date, portraying Elizabeth, and Gloria Pires in an equally powerful performance as Lota. When Elizabeth is suffering from writer's block, she decides to try the \"geographical cure\" and travels to Rio de Janeiro to visit her Vassar college friend Mary (Tracy Middendorf). Mary is in a relationship with the wealthy Lota, but after a rocky start Lota and Elizabeth fall in love and begin their own passionate relationship. As they say \"three's a crowd\", so Mary angrily leaves the residence but decides to return and take Lota up on her offer to live there and raise a baby, that Lota will literally buy from a poor family. I might note that to fairly rate this movie, I had to suspend my judgments on situations like this and the inequalities between these rich and powerful people and the vast majority of the rest of the Brazilian people. As you might imagine, this situation is not going to be conducive to harmony among the three women. Additionally, Elizabeth's drinking becomes more and more problematic, leading to even more discord. It will all eventually spiral into quite the tragic ending. All in all, I found this to be a really well presented and intelligent adult drama. It's ably directed by Brazilian filmmaker Bruno Barreto (Bossa Nova, Four Days in September), and there's a sharp screenplay from Matthew Chapman and Julie Sayres, based on the book \"Rare and Commonplace Flowers\", by Carmen Lucia de Oliveira. many layers of pleasure; Reaching for the moon So happy I saw this at preview.

I think it balanced well certain aspects... especially in the portrayal of their romance. They avoided being overly prudish and that made the romance seem more real. Without getting too kinky and losing focus. The contrast between the two characters is really interesting. The actress Gloria Pires who portrays Lota de Macedo Soares has worked in dozens of soap operas and that sometimes comes through in her films, but not this time thankfully. She so embodies the force of nature that was Lota and this comes through the screen very well. I felt like I was seeing a member of my old Rio family... so her amazing portrayal was certainly the highlight of the film for me. PS: Being a Macedo Soares myself (but too young to have known Lota)... there might be a bit of bias in my review.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\"I'm just a country doctor. People call me for bellyaches and chopped-off fingers.\"; Years before he became famous for his gimmicky (but extremely fun) horror flicks, William Castle directed and co-wrote this obscure B movie. The story is about the life of a midget named Harry and the hardships he has to endure. Don't watch this if you're very sensitive or easily depressed. The poor guy has to put up with a lot. Harry eventually does find happiness but how that comes about is kind of sad itself. Harry is played by Paul Dale, a little person whose only other credit on IMDb is that of a member of the Lollipop Guild in The Wizard of Oz. He does a very good job for an amateur. Will Geer plays Harry's father. He appears to be the only person in his town with a Southern accent. Todd Karns, of It's a Wonderful Life fame, plays the guy who befriends Harry and gives him a job shining shoes. Sexy Lorraine Miller is great as Buttons, the 'big woman' who leads Harry astray. There are moments where Castle displays some directorial flair, such as the scene where Harry's shadow talks to him while he sleeps or the scene where he runs away from the jerk who runs a carnival, only to be confronted by the jerk's laughing face everywhere he turns. Castle could be a talented director when he tried. The most ridiculous part of the film is near the end where Harry sings \"It's a Small World.\" No, not the Disney song; this one is worse. I'm sure there will be some people offended by this movie. I can sort of see why but I do believe Castle's intent was to tell the story of a midget sympathetically and not be exploitative. But yesterday's good intentions aren't always good enough viewed through a modern lens. It's an interesting movie, for sure. Some will watch it just to laugh but this isn't something like Terror of Tiny Town. Contrary to what IMDb currently lists it as, this is not a comedy. Not intentionally, anyway. Rather painful to watch; \"It's a Small World\", despite the title, is NOT a Disney film but an exploitation film about a midget. And, incidentally, it was written and directed by William Castle--a guy who sure knew how to promote his films! The film is about a fictional guy named Harry (Paul Dale). It starts with him as a 12 year-old (even though the actor appeared to be in his 30s or 40s) and his father is worried because his son stopped growing. Doctors are baffled and as the years pass, the boy's life gets tougher and tougher. His sister is a TOTAL b---- and is embarrassed by him-- and does little to hide this from poor Harry. And, as for most of the other folks in his life, they make fun of him and life is tough. So, he leaves home and goes in search of a new life. Unfortunately, he is befriended by some slime-bags who only want to exploit him. Can poor Harry somehow find love and acceptance some place?! The film is very painful to watch. Some of it is because you know that the movie is exploiting Paul Dale and hearing folks making fun of him is very hard. Also, too often it seems like Castle tries to make his point by using sledgehammer symbolism and over-exaggerations. Sure, life can be VERY tough for a small person like this, but too often the film came off as a campy and over-the-top account of a life that cannot help but be fictional. Had they just dialed back the examples a bit, it would have made the film a lot easier to watch and realistic. A strange chapter in the career of William Castle; \"It's a Small World\" is one of the stranger movies that director William Castle (who also wrote the screenplay) made in his career. On one hand, it does feel quite exploitive. There is liberal use of the now un-PC term \"midget\", among other kinds of abuse the short stature Paul Dale character has to endure almost non-stop until near the end of the movie. On the other hand, you do sense through all the abuse that Castle's heart was in the right place, trying to get the audience to sympathize with this character and to understand what problems short people must go through all through their lives. In the end, while I definitely wouldn't call this a good movie, or a movie for more sensitive and compassionate people, it is definitely one of a kind, and may be strange enough for those who have a taste for offbeat cinema. Couldn't believe I stayed awake through it.; Not sure if one can call this a bad movie or not. It is kind of one those huh movies. Thanks to TCM for the showing. Never seen it before, and there is probably a reason why it has not been shown often. For most of the film I thought Paul Dale was a kid, playing an adult. I think the director was trying to show that small people have the same emotions and problems as big people. He kind of shot over the characters and showed the whole world that small folks can be taken advantage of, just like everyone else down on their luck group by the movie industry. The musical number (Its a Small World), which is staged after the lead (Harry) finds true love, just adds to non-sense of the whole film. Even though the musical number was kind of delightful, I just had to feel sorry for everyone who was on the set, because the actors looked so out of place and uncomfortable singing in the midst of this lesson on using people. Too bad, I didn't fall asleep when this movie started. A definite exploitation classic; When I first saw this film I felt a sense of absurdity. It is a film that has close ties to both FREAKS (1932) and CHAINED FOR LIFE (1951). Same theme... what happens to the circus freak when he tries to live a normal life ? He is unwillingly taken advantage of. This time its the midget/actor Paul Dale that breaths life into a story where he is exploitet by some crooks that takes advantage of his size. The film does not take place in the entertainment business this time, but small town USA. We follow the day to day life of a midget that grows from child to adult. Many of the episodes in his life are very sad and depressing. But he is able to move forward and fights for his independence away from home. ITS A SMALL WORLD has a happy ending and love is found when he meets a woman his own size. Absurd ending takes place in a trailer where his new found love all of a sudden starts singing like she suddenly was in the middle of a musical. This film has to be seen to be believed. A film often ignored by lovers of exploitation films. Its worth watching, even if very slow at times, but like CHAINED FOR LIFE you might wonder if the producers of this film thought they would make money on this. I wonder if they did ? What was that?; I too stayed up and watched this on TCM last night. Wow! My first impression was I just saw the worst movie I have ever seen. But that is probably not true. Was it bad? Well, it wasn't good. The acting was mostly terrible, by almost everyone. Call it morbid curiosity but I would like to see it again to see how bad it was. It was only a little over 70 minutes long so when it ended I wasn't expecting it to end at that time. My first reaction was \"Huh?\" Followed closely by \"What was that\". Surely not for everyone but if you like B or bad films check this one out. It will certainly make you scratch your head. I will be looking to see when TCM is going to show it again.</td>\n",

       "585   A prim little movie about role models, not real people; Elizabeth Bishop and her lover Lota de Macedo Soares must have had a pretty rocky relationshipLota ended up killing herselfbut you'd never know it from this very prim and proper biopic. The filmmakers tone down any elements that might disturb or challenge a target audience looking not for historical accuracy (or even good drama) but rather for inspiring role models. So Bishop and de Macedo Soares are shown as two strong, successful, and loving women who never let little problems like raging alcoholism, rampant ruling-class careerism, or crushing egomania get them down, until the final reel, when the whole movie comes off the rails. Consider the scene where Elizabeth bakes a birthday cake for her beloved, who stands her up. What happens when self-obsessed Lota finally shows up, only to find Elizabeth sleeping off a bender? \"Oh, you so hurt my feelings!\" \"Oh, so sorry, lovey-poo!\" A little kissy-kissy and it's all better. Sorry, I ain't buying it. How much closer to the truth (not to mention more interesting, and believable) if this scene had erupted in a screaming row a la \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", with the bitter, alcoholic American vs. the brazen Brazil nut. Alas, that would never do in a movie that's all about role models, not real people who really lived, and really ended up in mental hospitals and really committed suicide. When Lota does go certifiably crazy, this development seems to come from nowhere, since we haven't been shown a clue that anything was wrong with her or her perfect world. In real life, there's always a telltale breadcrumb trail leading to the nervous breakdown, but not in this movie. Lota just all of a sudden goes crazy. Go figure. Despite its glossy veneer, this is a deeply phony movie, a deceptive testament to a poet and an architect who both deserve to be more realistically portrayed on the screen. Maybe someday we'll see a competent documentary about these two women, their achievements, and their complex relationship, instead of this beautifully shot, polite and pandering excuse for a biopic. Elegant, rapturous throwback to old Hollywood; Reaching for the Moon is the kind of movie everyone hopes for but no one makes: a gay romance where \"gay romance\" is not the premise. Director Bruno Barreto focuses instead on how Elizabeth Bishop and Lota de Macedo Soares challenged and changed the world and each other in other ways, and that was absolutely the right choice - these women and their story are fascinating and make for top class entertainment. And it is entertaining. Considering the characters' issues and the story's ending it could have been drab, but the film is always lively and engaging. It flies by. Bishop takes herself very seriously, but Barreto maintains a sense of humor about it and makes fun of her just enough to keep her melodrama under control. An added bonus is that Miranda Otto gets to show off her underrated and underused comedic chops; one particular drunk scene is priceless. Glória Pires is dynamic and fiery as Lota but Otto is the real star, channeling Greta Garbo and Deborah Kerr in a gracefully commanding performance. She doesn't shy away from Bishop's spikiness, but her screen presence is so compelling that as much as we might be frustrated with her character, we can't take our eyes off her. Thanks to her constantly surprising performance, an eclectic ensemble cast, breathtaking visuals, and assured direction, Reaching for the Moon pulses with energy and is a breath of fresh air in an era of stuffy and bland biopics. Highlights: Shots of Rio de Janeiro that belong on postcards; a performance from Miranda Otto that would have won an Oscar in 1937; the assertion that some things are more important than whether a person is gay Verdict: Watch this with your parents instead of Blue Is the Warmest Color Gloria Pires as Lota De Macedo Soares...; Lovely. A story here that is not overshadowed by the relationships, politics, or agenda. It is, simply beautifully filmed, the beaches of Rio De Janeiro, the beautiful home Lota has deigned in part to accommodate her new lover, poet Elizabeth Bishop, completely played by Miranda Otto. Otto is at once restrained yet yearning, a Vassar graduate visiting her friend, who initially is puzzled (and indeed overwhelmed) by the beauty and passion of South America. She plays the American New England spinster type well, without a stereotype here. We can feel she wants, and NEEDS to break free from societal restraints. The filming of the rain forests, the owls at night, the visuals are incredible. Lota Soares was politically connected and designed the park near Carioca beach, the title infers, reaching for the moon has so may more connotations for each woman. What is most refreshing is the way this film is written, sensitive to the issues each woman experiences, it is an individual and a private journey. The actress portraying Carlotta Soares is affecting and sad, and Miranda Otto is quite believable as Bishop. The story is beautiful and sad, and the scenery of Brazil is not to be missed, simply beautiful, and beautifully filmed. 10/10 Genuíno; A gentle movie about relationships between three women. (Yes, I say three women as Mary lived with Bishop and Lota until the latter die.) And as every human relationship it is permeated with high, low and ... drama moments. When it comes to women it seems that directors never forget the drama. Blend together alcoholism, passion, money and drama and you have a genuine, feasible film, if based on true events. It feels that the characters lack in depth a little bit, but in this movie that was a good thing to me since the movie did not intend to replicate accurately the events (hence it is not possible to truly know what happened) . Therefore, t is up to the viewer to infer the finest nuances of those people based on the most general outlines shown in the film. It is a film to be savored and reflected as the years pass by within the plot. Philosophic analysis of poet Elizabeth Bishop's tragic love affair; However truthful to Elizabeth Bishop's tragic love affair with Brazilian architect Lota de Macedo Soares, Bruno Barreto's Reaching for the Moon is more generally engaged with the question: Is the examined life worth suffering? In this corner, Elizabeth (Miranda Otto), a wan, fragile, painfully timid and insecure poet who is mortified to hear one of her poems read aloud. In her insecurity and sense of powerlessness she is Woman. She dresses like an office manager's wife and wears her hair tight to her face. She compulsively observes and anatomizes her observations. Her life is at first nothing but her examining it. In contrast Lota has a large strong face, flowing long hair, a man's stocky build, and a man's aggressive stride and nature. She never questions herself or her impulses and she has the money not just to do what she wants but to get others to do so too. When she tells Elizabeth that she and her current amour, Elizabeth's college friend Mary (Tracy Middendorf), were just roommates, she admits Mary hasn't thought that. Probably Lota hasn't either. To draw Mary back into her fold as a friend Lota buys her a child. Lota is also creative, designing her sumptuous country estate and  after she helps friend Carlos (Marcello Airoldi) get elected Governor  designs and supervises the construction of a large public park, with towering standards to provide the magic of moonlight. But she's not a thinker, a meditator. She just acts. Not given to self-analysis, when the new guest Elizabeth arrives Lota leaps to wrong conclusions about her. Part of their antithesis is cultural. As Elizabeth drunkenly tells the Rio audience at her National Book Awards dinner, \"How can someone raised in the desert swim like a fish?\" The withdrawn Elizabeth doesn't understand the Brazilian exuberance, constant joy, and carefreeness, as they celebrate everything  even after the military coup has reduced their freedoms. But the contrast is mainly in the women's character. Still, though Lota is the first to express her love for Elizabeth  which the poet only reciprocates when Lota is asleep  in their first clinch Elizabeth assumes the ardent initiative. And despite -- or because of -- her relentless analyzing, Elizabeth is an alcoholic. With her deep pessimism and self-doubt, Elizabeth stumbles from success to success: the Pulitzer, the NBA, a slot in The New Yorker, the man Aldous Huxley's approval, a teaching gig at NYU. Her life examining works for her. But the ebullient, confident Lota breaks down at her first defeat: the new government corrupts her vision of the park, converting it into the cliché sterile paved soccer court. When Elizabeth asks if her going to New York caused Lota's depression, Mary clearly blames the ruin of her project. \"How could you think anyone could be that confident?\" For her part, Mary begins as a jejeune, non-thinking sort who doesn't expect her college friend to steal her lover. Dumped, Mary realizes she has \"no other option\" than to love Lota. But by film end she has learned to read people and situations. Motherhood may have taught her wariness. When she aborts Elizabeth's correspondence with Lota it is not out of selfish malice, but because she knows that Lota's losing Elizabeth again would destroy her. Events prove her right. Hence the poem Elizabeth ends too soon at the start of the film and rounds out at the end. \"The art of losing isn't hard to master.\" Not if you're a thinker. The frightened self- doubter sees enough loss to handle her own and not just thrive but survive. The robust willful woman who never paused to consider human vulnerability is defeated by her first loss  and kills herself at the second. This Is A Nice Film To Watch But Don't Expect Anything; the only main reason to watch this film & like it you have to lower your expectations its a nice film it is a half fiction half biopic on real life American poet & Brazilian architect there is a lesbian relationship shown here but no sex scene its just some kissing scene involved its too slow & long for anyone to like it but i id. the plot:the story revolves around an American poet Elizabeth Bishop & Lota De Macedo Soares during the building of Brazilian capital Brasilia around 1951 & 1967. the cast;everyone did nice acting specially the leading ladies they tried there best like they have done this before everything was so easy for them. overall i liked it for what it was you will to just forget the critics they lie its a good film overall Reaching For The Moon 2013 deserves a one time watch at least my rating is 5/10. A melodramatic movie about a melodramatic situation; The Brazilian movie Flores Raras was shown in the United States with the title Reaching for the Moon (2013). It was directed by Bruno Barreto. The film is based on the life of the great American poet, Elizabeth Bishop (Miranda Otto). As the movie begins, Elizabeth is traveling in Brazil, and visits the estate of the famous architect Lota de Macedo Soares, played by Glória Pires. Lota is in a lesbian relationship with Bishop's college friend Mary (Tracy Middendorf). Despite Elizabeth's somewhat proper and restricted outlook, she accepts the love offered by Lota, even though this leaves Mary as the odd woman out. This act struck me as a shabby betrayal of an old friend, but, in the movie, it's treated as true love that makes such betrayal acceptable, if not inevitable. It doesn't hurt that Lota has an enormous estate, and enormous resources. As an architect, Lota is able to envision and then design a beautiful writer's studio for Elizabeth. The strong point of the movie is that it presents the writing of poetry as work. Elizabeth doesn't just close her eyes and wait until the poetic muse strikes her. She sits in the studio and pushes and pulls her poetry into shape. She's also not happy when she's interrupted during the creative process. This is the only film I can remember where creating a poem is shown as a process, and a delicate and difficult process at that. This idyllic existence is disrupted by Brazilian political events, into which Lota plunges. The remainder of the movie is devoted to how these events play out in the lives of Elizabeth and Lota. I don't know enough about the details of the coup, or of the lives of the film's principals, to know how accurately the film portrays them. This aspect of the movie is highly melodramatic, but the actual events were probably equally melodramatic. Certainly, the film holds your interest as the situation plays itself out to the end. We saw this movie on the large screen, where it will work better, especially in the scenes set on Lota's estate. However, it will work well enough on the small screen. It's not a great movie, but it's certainly good enough to repay you for finding and watching it. A deeply moving surprise of a film; I was sad to see this deeply moving, complex and intelligent story of the love between the award winning American poet Elizabeth Bishop and Brazilian architect Lota de Macedo Soares. so overlooked by U.S, audiences and critics. There are two outstanding performances by Miranda Otto as the outwardly shy and repressed alcoholic Bishop, and Gloria Pires as her opposite, an extroverted, highly emotional woman who coaxes Bishop out of her shell. Very nicely photographed, this reminded me of the best of the Merchant-Ivory films. It's not flashy. Indeed there's a quiet to it that is needed to off-set the melodramatic (even if based in truths) elements of these women's lives. But that doesn't keep it from packing a hell of an emotional punch, and in being bold enough to create characters we care for, but who are also deeply troubled and capable of making bad choices  just like in the real world of relationships we rarely see on screen. It was also nice to see a gay-themed love story that both acknowledged how difficult being homosexual was in the 1950s, while not becoming a film about that only. This is a film about a complex relationship between two highly creative and wounded souls who both save and damage each other. The fact that both are women is only a small part of the larger story. It's also one of the only films I've seen capture at least a taste of the struggle and loneliness of the act of writing. One of those little gems that deserves to be discovered by more people. A Must to see for all poets and fans of poetry; After the famous poet, Elizabeth Bishop, is greatly mentored by the star poet Robert Lowell, she, travels to Brazil, on her inheritance, has a love affair with a wealthy, female architect, who is in another love relationship with a former fellow student of Bishop's at Vassar College, called Mary. This threesome love relationship fails because each person involved in this relationship has a main flaw. Bishop's flaw is alcoholism. The architect's flaw is that she works herself to the point of mental insanity. Mary's flaw is jealousy. She does not want to share her architect girlfriend with Elizabeth Bishop, understandably. When watching the film in the cinema, yesterday, with the oranges and the red wine, I bought at the booth, all of us clapped at the end of the film, with wonderful actors, very beautiful scenery of Brazil as well as fantastic architecture, before tortillas, guacamole, nachos, corona and other Latin American snacks that were cheaply sold outside. This positive account begs the question, why I did not rate that film to be so good. Like many art-house or like many artsy films, Reaching for the Moon, we hardly know who most of the characters in this film truly are. There is just not enough character development in the film. We do not know what exactly makes Miss Bishop travel, why she loves this architect, why the architect loves her and why Mary loves this architect. We also do not know their views about belonging to a sexual minority. We do not know the reason for their flaws, such as the traumatic experiences that made Miss Bishop an alcoholic, what made the architect a workaholic, who does not talk to her family, and we know almost nothing about this third girl Mary, except that she went to University with Miss Bishop. We do not know the exact cause or even the nature of the architect's insanity. When she kills herself, she leaves no note, and nobody even asks or tries to find out why the hell she did it or if it was an accident. Like most films about poetry little attention is paid to the kind of Poetry Miss Bishop wrote, so that when she wins the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, in the film, you still end up leaving the movie theatre wondering why her poetry was considered to be so special, apart from the fact that she was rich, well educated and knew some of the greatest poets like Robert Lowell and Marian Moore. This film is full of paper Mache' characters, in which you hardly know who the people in the film are, despite the strong attempts of the actors in the film to act as well as possible, which made the film worth watching, especially as a poet and author myself, amongst other things. Gorgeous, real, richly evocative on many levels; Reaching for the Moon (2013) Wonderful! The story of the Brazilian years of the great North American poet, Elizabeth Bishop. There are so many beautiful aspects to the characters, their setting, and their relationships it's hard to know where to begin. And even better, on top of all this, is the historical recreation of the times, and the changing political climate of Brazil. It's touching and uplifting and tragic. The original title of this is \"Flores Raras\" because these were indeed rare people, and doing beautiful things. And yes, they were reaching for the moon but you might rather say they reached the moon. Succeeding at something is more than literally fulfilling. The plot has a slightly meandering, unfamiliar arc through the main events, and there are times when you think one thing and then suddenly another happens. Don't blame bad writing, but rather realize that this is how life is, and how it really was. Remember as well that these are artists of privilege at work, they have money and education and act with a kind of license and liberation that we all should feel. And so it's unpredictable. As a kind of true insight into the poetic process you might find few parallels in the movies. You learn their temperaments, and how circumstances make the artist and the poet come to their best. The intimate circumstances are about love, a really true deep love that grows between these two women. Their professional needs reinforce and conflict with their personal needs, but they make it work. The outside circumstances are hard to understand from 2014. Brazil was once a very different country, filled with far more freedom and sense of liberation. (This seems to be a direction that are pointed in again, though going through fits and starts.) But the world in post-War Brazil was one of possibility. It was a haven (not just for ex-Nazis) and a growing \"New World,\" but it was also stuffed with poverty (which the movie ignores), a legacy still at hand. And this is exciting stuff. The movie moves mostly through the confines of their big, gorgeous estate in the hills, but it also shows us the city, and the larger world. So Bishop and Lota de Macedo Soares, an important architect of the era. grow and suffer and see their world fall apart around them (Brazil fell under dictatorship in the mid 1960s). It's filmed with utter beauty, the acting is sharp and convincing, and the writing (not surprisingly) is fluid and tight. Great stuff. Involving, watchable, grown-up - sound like your kind of movie?; I enjoyed this story of a lengthy midlife love affair, \"based on\" (that is, \"not cemented to the known facts of\") real women of some mid-century renown. One, American poet Elizabeth Bishop, is quiet, slow to warm to strangers or share working drafts of her poems. See if Miranda Otto doesn't remind you of Deborah Kerr in her memorable 1940s and '50s roles (and clothes). In Brazil to visit an old college friend, Elizabeth meets Lota de Macedo Soares, a charismatic commander of attention and glamorously trousered architect. They become lovers and make their life in Brazil. All the characters, including a close male friend of Lota's and one of Elizabeth's, are revelations in the best sense: mature but unfinished adults, they meet their circumstances over nearly 20 years in ways not even they might be able to predict. Mark Twain said that fiction is obliged to meet our expectations but the truth isn't. Central Casting can provide \"types,\" but history offers people like nobody else, which is why you'll find discussions here and elsewhere complaining that these lesbians were not put through their proper lesbian plot paces! The drunks were sometimes sober! People got depressed without enough foreshadowing! Ignore all that. This is a good quiet story, mostly but not all sad, about people learning themselves as they go, living genuinely if not always bravely. And anyone who's ever dreamed of having a writer's sanctuary will fall rapturously in love with the al fresco study Lota builds for Elizabeth. Must be seen to be appreciated! Enthralling; I just finished watching this on Netflix streaming. I will be honest, I had not heard of either Elizabeth Bishop (not a poetry reader) or Lota de Macedo Soares (don't know that much about Brazilian history). What an explosion of a true story. I was memorized. Miranda Otto, who always delivers a great performance in everything that I've seen her in, was amazing. Her character was such a conflicted person and she came out doing it brilliantly! Now, for Gloria Pires, she was a force to be reckoned with. I can't say anymore than that. When she was on the screen, it was hard to NOT to look at her. Tracy Middendort was heart wrenching as the jilted lover. I could feel what she was going through because haven't we all had to do that at one time or another? Brava to all three leading ladies. Their performances were excellent and so true to life! many layers of pleasure; Reaching for the moon So happy I saw this at preview. To test a film we were made to wait one hour almost while they got an unlock code to the digital file! If that isn't a test I can't think of another. This film passed across this barrier with aplomb. Both actor do a commendable job. The location is magic, a valley of lush greenery just outside Rio Janeiro Brazil. The relationship depicted works with the strange sub plot of the other woman r remain and bringing up baby, quite bazaar when you think back. For me the greatest pleasure might be discovery of Elizabeth bishop poems. I feel very fortunate to have added these to my experience of human condition. Further test I will see this film again tomorrow, not 2 weeks since the first viewing. A most unusual thing for me, the relentless consumer of movie's. The things that will hold are the script the locations, the cinematography, and so the direction. To discover the gestation of this movie over what 20 years and the passion that held the project alive to it's realization on screen are a compliment to all involved.! It'd be hard not to enjoy this film and opened to a world ratified and rarely accessible. Intense & Intelligent Drama; I found this film to be an intense and intelligent drama, which was well acted, scripted, and directed. Based on a true story, it centers on the lesbian relationship between acclaimed poet Elizabeth Bishop and Brazilian architect Lota de Macedo Soares, during the 1950's and 60's in Brazil. Both lead actresses are superb here, with Miranda Otto, in perhaps her best performance to date, portraying Elizabeth, and Gloria Pires in an equally powerful performance as Lota. When Elizabeth is suffering from writer's block, she decides to try the \"geographical cure\" and travels to Rio de Janeiro to visit her Vassar college friend Mary (Tracy Middendorf). Mary is in a relationship with the wealthy Lota, but after a rocky start Lota and Elizabeth fall in love and begin their own passionate relationship. As they say \"three's a crowd\", so Mary angrily leaves the residence but decides to return and take Lota up on her offer to live there and raise a baby, that Lota will literally buy from a poor family. I might note that to fairly rate this movie, I had to suspend my judgments on situations like this and the inequalities between these rich and powerful people and the vast majority of the rest of the Brazilian people. As you might imagine, this situation is not going to be conducive to harmony among the three women. Additionally, Elizabeth's drinking becomes more and more problematic, leading to even more discord. It will all eventually spiral into quite the tragic ending. All in all, I found this to be a really well presented and intelligent adult drama. It's ably directed by Brazilian filmmaker Bruno Barreto (Bossa Nova, Four Days in September), and there's a sharp screenplay from Matthew Chapman and Julie Sayres, based on the book \"Rare and Commonplace Flowers\", by Carmen Lucia de Oliveira. many layers of pleasure; Reaching for the moon So happy I saw this at preview.

I think it balanced well certain aspects... especially in the portrayal of their romance. They avoided being overly prudish and that made the romance seem more real. Without getting too kinky and losing focus. The contrast between the two characters is really interesting. The actress Gloria Pires who portrays Lota de Macedo Soares has worked in dozens of soap operas and that sometimes comes through in her films, but not this time thankfully. She so embodies the force of nature that was Lota and this comes through the screen very well. I felt like I was seeing a member of my old Rio family... so her amazing portrayal was certainly the highlight of the film for me. PS: Being a Macedo Soares myself (but too young to have known Lota)... there might be a bit of bias in my review.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \"I'm just a country doctor. People call me for bellyaches and chopped-off fingers.\"; Years before he became famous for his gimmicky (but extremely fun) horror flicks, William Castle directed and co-wrote this obscure B movie. The story is about the life of a midget named Harry and the hardships he has to endure. Don't watch this if you're very sensitive or easily depressed. The poor guy has to put up with a lot. Harry eventually does find happiness but how that comes about is kind of sad itself. Harry is played by Paul Dale, a little person whose only other credit on IMDb is that of a member of the Lollipop Guild in The Wizard of Oz. He does a very good job for an amateur. Will Geer plays Harry's father. He appears to be the only person in his town with a Southern accent. Todd Karns, of It's a Wonderful Life fame, plays the guy who befriends Harry and gives him a job shining shoes. Sexy Lorraine Miller is great as Buttons, the 'big woman' who leads Harry astray. There are moments where Castle displays some directorial flair, such as the scene where Harry's shadow talks to him while he sleeps or the scene where he runs away from the jerk who runs a carnival, only to be confronted by the jerk's laughing face everywhere he turns. Castle could be a talented director when he tried. The most ridiculous part of the film is near the end where Harry sings \"It's a Small World.\" No, not the Disney song; this one is worse. I'm sure there will be some people offended by this movie. I can sort of see why but I do believe Castle's intent was to tell the story of a midget sympathetically and not be exploitative. But yesterday's good intentions aren't always good enough viewed through a modern lens. It's an interesting movie, for sure. Some will watch it just to laugh but this isn't something like Terror of Tiny Town. Contrary to what IMDb currently lists it as, this is not a comedy. Not intentionally, anyway. Rather painful to watch; \"It's a Small World\", despite the title, is NOT a Disney film but an exploitation film about a midget. And, incidentally, it was written and directed by William Castle--a guy who sure knew how to promote his films! The film is about a fictional guy named Harry (Paul Dale). It starts with him as a 12 year-old (even though the actor appeared to be in his 30s or 40s) and his father is worried because his son stopped growing. Doctors are baffled and as the years pass, the boy's life gets tougher and tougher. His sister is a TOTAL b---- and is embarrassed by him-- and does little to hide this from poor Harry. And, as for most of the other folks in his life, they make fun of him and life is tough. So, he leaves home and goes in search of a new life. Unfortunately, he is befriended by some slime-bags who only want to exploit him. Can poor Harry somehow find love and acceptance some place?! The film is very painful to watch. Some of it is because you know that the movie is exploiting Paul Dale and hearing folks making fun of him is very hard. Also, too often it seems like Castle tries to make his point by using sledgehammer symbolism and over-exaggerations. Sure, life can be VERY tough for a small person like this, but too often the film came off as a campy and over-the-top account of a life that cannot help but be fictional. Had they just dialed back the examples a bit, it would have made the film a lot easier to watch and realistic. A strange chapter in the career of William Castle; \"It's a Small World\" is one of the stranger movies that director William Castle (who also wrote the screenplay) made in his career. On one hand, it does feel quite exploitive. There is liberal use of the now un-PC term \"midget\", among other kinds of abuse the short stature Paul Dale character has to endure almost non-stop until near the end of the movie. On the other hand, you do sense through all the abuse that Castle's heart was in the right place, trying to get the audience to sympathize with this character and to understand what problems short people must go through all through their lives. In the end, while I definitely wouldn't call this a good movie, or a movie for more sensitive and compassionate people, it is definitely one of a kind, and may be strange enough for those who have a taste for offbeat cinema. Couldn't believe I stayed awake through it.; Not sure if one can call this a bad movie or not. It is kind of one those huh movies. Thanks to TCM for the showing. Never seen it before, and there is probably a reason why it has not been shown often. For most of the film I thought Paul Dale was a kid, playing an adult. I think the director was trying to show that small people have the same emotions and problems as big people. He kind of shot over the characters and showed the whole world that small folks can be taken advantage of, just like everyone else down on their luck group by the movie industry. The musical number (Its a Small World), which is staged after the lead (Harry) finds true love, just adds to non-sense of the whole film. Even though the musical number was kind of delightful, I just had to feel sorry for everyone who was on the set, because the actors looked so out of place and uncomfortable singing in the midst of this lesson on using people. Too bad, I didn't fall asleep when this movie started. A definite exploitation classic; When I first saw this film I felt a sense of absurdity. It is a film that has close ties to both FREAKS (1932) and CHAINED FOR LIFE (1951). Same theme... what happens to the circus freak when he tries to live a normal life ? He is unwillingly taken advantage of. This time its the midget/actor Paul Dale that breaths life into a story where he is exploitet by some crooks that takes advantage of his size. The film does not take place in the entertainment business this time, but small town USA. We follow the day to day life of a midget that grows from child to adult. Many of the episodes in his life are very sad and depressing. But he is able to move forward and fights for his independence away from home. ITS A SMALL WORLD has a happy ending and love is found when he meets a woman his own size. Absurd ending takes place in a trailer where his new found love all of a sudden starts singing like she suddenly was in the middle of a musical. This film has to be seen to be believed. A film often ignored by lovers of exploitation films. Its worth watching, even if very slow at times, but like CHAINED FOR LIFE you might wonder if the producers of this film thought they would make money on this. I wonder if they did ? What was that?; I too stayed up and watched this on TCM last night. Wow! My first impression was I just saw the worst movie I have ever seen. But that is probably not true. Was it bad? Well, it wasn't good. The acting was mostly terrible, by almost everyone. Call it morbid curiosity but I would like to see it again to see how bad it was. It was only a little over 70 minutes long so when it ended I wasn't expecting it to end at that time. My first reaction was \"Huh?\" Followed closely by \"What was that\". Surely not for everyone but if you like B or bad films check this one out. It will certainly make you scratch your head. I will be looking to see when TCM is going to show it again.   \n",
