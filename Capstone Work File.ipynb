Through a pair of crude headphones, the latter device supplied an asynchronous soundtrack of \\\"hootchie-cootchie\\\" music. \\r \\r The Kinetograph camera here employed is so new -- even to its inventors \\r -- that director Dickson has drastically \\\"overcranked\\\" the film, unintentionally producing one of the first examples of slow-motion.\\r \\r Carmencita's titillating movements were considered by many to be \\r scandalous. Thus, the film prompted some of the earliest discussions of film censorship.\"}"

       "      <td>Overhyped, over praised, and just plain dull....; Yes people, I will dare to come out as the perhaps only person to truly hate this film.  While the animation is groundbreaking to say the least, it doesn't mean that it has a story to back it up.  I for one love cartoon movies, but this left a sour taste in  my mouth.  Maybe it's because in what is supposed to be a kids' movie, we see one character trying to \"off\" another character, out of pure jealousy.  The other toys were just annoying as the chorus, as they, like the leads, had a total lack of any real character.  There were some bad attempts at humor that didn't even win a giggle out of me or my family. Skip it and see Shrek or Ice Age.  Better stories to balance the animation. An unmissable film; From our first sight of Woody until his happy face disappears off of the screen the makers of this film keep audiences worldwide glued to the screen with eager anticipation. The films unlikely scenario where talking toys battle to save a fellow toys life is amazingly gripping and a \"must see\" which will keep the whole family (yes even the teenageers) amused. The more mature audience will recognise the \"spoofy\"side to the movie. This is most noticeable when plastic soldiers (who mimic the actors in \"Who saves wins\") jump off  bannisters with miniature parachutes and talk to each through baby monitering systems.!!! In conclusion, TOY STORY is one of the most thought out films in the industry as props and scenerycan not just be found lying around and everything had to be individually designed, crafted and computerised To Infinity and Beyond!; It was May of 1991, and Disney were on the brink of the Animation Renaissance which would bring about a treasure-trove of beautifully drawn and designed 2D films. Only a few months later would the first and very elegant Beauty and The Beast be released. But behind the scenes, they negotiated a deal with a small animation studio named Pixar, previously only animating shorts to demonstrate the capabilities of their computers. John Lasseter would serve as director after being fired from Disney as he pitched the revolutionary idea of the first ever fully computer animated full length feature film. And so Toy Story was born. It was a long and complicated production process full of worries about budget, and the infamous Black Friday reveal which prompted a production shut-down and a full script revamp. It's sequel would later nearly undergo a disaster of similar scale. But after an arduous process Toy Story became a ground breaking film in animation history and set the first benchmark for 3D animation. Toy Story is a beautifully rendered film for its time and eye poppingly gorgeous. Pixar's revolutionary animation process created a living breathing world with every tiny detail lovingly crafted - blades of grass, hairs on head, scuffs on floorboards. The character movement is smooth and seamless, the use of light and shadow realistic. Being Pixar's first ever feature film and under close scrutiny from Disney executives and given a small budget, short cuts like ponytails and short hair were used, and the textures of the background and minor characters are less visually impressive, but Tory Story still holds up remarkably well decades later. It's all wrapped in a stirring score by Randy Newman which easily accompanies the film's movement; lifting for Buzz's first take-off, eerily tip-toeing at the Spaceport Arcade. The main song You've Got a Friend in Me is heartfelt at the start of the film but even more-so at the end, Newman duetting with Lyle Lovett to symbolise the new partnership of Buzz and Woody. The story is a simple but universal one, with an original twist. What happens when toys are alive, and furthermore, what happens when they are replaced by newer, cooler models? The titular characters of Buzz and Woody are stunningly brought to life through fantastic character design and voice-acting. Woody is your classic Western cowboy with a pull string that spouts recorded catchphrases while Buzz Lightyear is a futuristic Space Ranger who has pop-out wings and a laser. Who can compete with that? Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide a great deal of emotion and character through their respective portrayals; in particular Woody's charm and leadership is a thin veneer for his insecurity and ego which is displayed when Andy gets a newer toy. Terry Gilliam singles out a great shot at the height of Buzz's personality as a Space Ranger, where he discover he is actually just a toy, and where the camera zooms out and the big bravado he was only a moment earlier is now a tiny figure. But apart from them you have a whole cast of iconic characters each with their quirks, personalities and traits; Mr Potato Head, Re the dinosaur, Slinky Dog, Hamm the piggy bank, Bo Peep, the plastic toy soldiers...We get the sense that these toys have been in the Andy household forever, and have formed a tight knit family and well-oiled hierarchy. the sequel 4 years later gives them additional screen-time which comes with more laughs (including the addition of Mr Potato Head's wife). Toy Story set the first benchmark for computer animation and heralded a period of critical and box office success for Pixar. The 2 sequels are also crafted with as much detail and care as the first, but nothing can match the first gasps of wonder and amazement at the movement and freedom of the 3D world when it first hit cinemas in 1995. An affectionate love letter to toys and film; This was Pixar's first feature-length film, the first full-length computer-animated feature film and the first film in the Toy Story series. There will be spoilers ahead: I could just say that this is a phenomenal film, a ground-breaking film and a must watch if you love film in general and/or animation in particular and leave it at that, but this comment would be rather thin if I did so, so I'll do a bit more here. I don't really need to discuss the plot, because, chances are, if you're reading this, you've probably seen this already. I'll do a brief sketch: this concerns a boy named Andy and his toys. Lifeless when humans are around, the toys come to life when none are in the room. Woody is the leader of the toys, but his place is threatened by a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. Andy and family are preparing to move. Through a series of mishaps, Woody and Buzz wind up being lost and must make their way back before the family leaves or be separated from Andy forever. After a series of adventures, they make it back and get on board before the family is gone. That's a simple story. The parts of the film are each so excellently crafted that it takes a simple story and creates gold. The animation still holds up, even after 20 years, which is an eternity in computer animation. The script is marvelous and the writers clearly show that they possess a love for both toys and film. The toys showing up in here are a mix of new (Woody and Buzz) and classic (Mr. Potatohead, Etch-a-Sketch and green army soldiers). There are gags referencing films as diverse as Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Wizard of Oz. Pixar also references the various shorts they'd made up to that point and TV shows like Star Trek and The Simpsons. The voice casting is spot on. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen nailed their parts. Don Rickles and Jim Varney were inspired casting choices and John Ratzenberger began an association with Pixar which continues today. The score and songs by Randy Newman are perfect, particularly the song, \"You've Got a Friend In Me\", which goes to the heart of the film. It's just an exceptional film. The attention to detail is incredible. Even minor characters turn out to have a significant influence on things, like the mutant toys in Sid's bedroom (Sid and his dog Scud are the villains here, Sid being a rather twisted kid next door). The look of everything is astonishing, though it has aged in 20 years. This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray is is well worth getting. Most highly recommended. The first of it's kind.; Toy story is the first Pixar animated film. Toy story amazed everyone on earth back in 1995 and still does to this day. That amazes us and so does Pixar. Bringing us some of the best films of our time. Nowadays we have Up, Ratatouille, Wall E, Finding Nemo. The list goes on. But we should remember the first one. Toy story stars Tim Allen and Tom Hanks as Toys. Hanks plays Woody, a cowboy toy who is the most popular from his owner Andy. That all changes when Andy buys a toy called Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen) who is an astronaut. Woody becomes awfully jealous and tries everything in his power to get rid of Buzz. There are other plot points that I would rather not go into. Toy story creeps me out a little. The thing about it that creeps me out is the villain named Sid. Sid is this toy murderer who lives next door to Andy and the toy gang. There is a part in the end when all of the toys retaliate. That part scares me every time. Watching these destroyed toys retaliate. I never thought something like that could creep me out. I guess I get creeped too easily. The first Toy story is a work of art. It's got great visuals and will creep you out. Kind of like Robert Zemeckis' A Christmas carol, which is another work of art I think. As I have said in many reviews, Toy story is a film that you'll never forget. I haven't. My memory is crap. Toy story:****/**** The first one will be remembered the most; The movie isn't just the first one in the Toy Story series, but also the first movie Pixar ever created and they didn't waste any time showing us what they could do. This movie shows what being creative is all about. The soul ingredient of the story is simply what happens when your toys are left alone and the benefits (and downfalls) of being a toy. But what amazes me the most is the emotional connection that it gives to anyone at any age and what keeps it together is the friendship between toys, even though they are only toys, the movie easily grasps the emotions of 2 people turned into best friends. Of course sometime in the future another animated movie will have the same success or more than Toy Story and may even beat it. But Toy Story will always be remembered as the first, and never will be forgotten. Best Toy Story Movie; This movie is funny, hilarious, humorous1 It makes the whole wide world wanna laugh! This movie is so funny, you'd laugh your butt off! I liked it how Sid scared his sister but messing up her toys. I wish I can do what he does to the Animal Crossing players! They make me sick because they suck more than Justin Bieber. Also, it's funny how Woody murdered Buzz! Also Bo Peep reminds me of Princess Peach from the Super Mario series. She should have appeared in the other Toy Story movies. I can't believe they screwed up on Toy Story 3, one of the worst Toy Story movies ever! I hope they don't ever screw up Toy Story 4, which comes out next year. Wonderful animated feature...; TOY STORY is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. It goes along with TOY STORY 2, TARZAN, A BUG'S LIFE, THE LION KING and CHICKEN RUN as some of my favorite animated features. Tom Hank s voices Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll owned by a boy named Andy who is the most-played toy until a space ranger, Buzz (Tim Allen) comes along and Woody is not good friends with them. But one day later, a mean toy-hating man who owns a collection of mutant toys and tries to threaten Buzz, and it is up to Woody to save Buzz with the help of the mutants before it's too late to escape to Andy's new house. The sequel is better than the original, but TOY STORY is a good movie. **** What Makes a Toy a Toy?; Marvellously inventive, brilliantly rendered, perfectly paced, adorably characterized CGI gem with a sinister edge to its witty and intelligent storyline. The voice cast is a pleasure to behold and the toy figures are instantly likable. The alternation between action-packed moments, laugh-out-loud gags and scenes of emotional, downright existential crises offers a deeper viewing experience anyone could've hoped for. Despite two well-made sequels, this one's still the best installment of the much-loved franchise. 8 out of 10 freak toys Another Childhood Favorite!!!; I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since. It has a great storyline. Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, and many more. On Andy's Birthday, he receives a Buzz Lightyear action hero, and Woody becomes jealous because he isn't Andy's favorite anymore. When Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, his friends want nothing to do with him. On the way to Pizza Planet, Buzz confronts him in the family van, and knocks him outside and the family drive off without them. They go through a lot trying to get back to Andy before they move. When they end up in Sid's room, the kid who tortures toys, Woody and Buzz must work together in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TOY STORY!!! A pioneer; You may or may not like \"Toy Story\", but there's something that's perfectly clear: it changed for good the animation cinema. Pixar were pioneers not only in the world of 3D animation but also in offering products that might entertain children and adults. I do prefer movies such as \"Antz\" or \"Shrek\", but I think \"Toy story\" is so funny as well. Anyway, we can't avoid the \"Disney touch\" and all those awful songs... So, after \"Toy story\" came other movies that were much better, but this was the first one and it has a relevant position in the history of cinema. *My rate: 6/10 Really Sweet Movie!; Whether you're a fan of animated Disney movies or not, this movie is brilliant! It's great for family time movies or great for the everyday average Disney fan. The characters are put together very well. After I saw it, it made me actually think about throwing out old toys. I've been a fan of this movie ever since I was born(it was really big then) and I still watch it from time to time. I would definitely recommend this to anybody. Great fun for anyone; Toy Story is definitely a film that a kid should watch before they are a teen. Its adventure and great sense of humour is appealing to adult audiences as well, and the atmosphere is brilliant. This really is a Toy Story. The plot is indeed quite simple, and it would have to be for a classic family. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks)is a toy 'sheriff' doll, owned by a young boy called Andy. Woodys Toy life couldn't as Andy loves him a lot, but as Andy's birthday party arises tension fills the bedroom with each toy living in fear of being replaced. Everything goes well till the last birthday present is opened.. enter Buzz Lightyear! I would be criminal to tell you the rest of the story, but as far as humour and adventure are concerned, this film impresses in both categories. The toys different personalities really contrast and make you laugh, from the smart-chat of Mr. Potatoe head, to Slinky who is Woodys best toy friend. Its so easy to follow this film - the plot and characters are easy to watch the computer graphics are top notch. Compared to modern day CGI kids films, this stands out purely because of its innocence - a simple story, theirs no techno-babble, and its really fun. This truly is the film of the Nineties! The best film for big adults...; It's too bad the first user comment was that this is the best film for small children.  It's not just for kids!  My husband and I were 35 and childless when we first saw this.  We took a chance and purchased it before we saw it. After viewing it for the first time, we immediately watched it again.  It was if we had been on a really fun ride, and had to get back in line again. And fun is the operative word.  What a fun movie.  It's what I look for in a movie - something that takes you away from the cares of the world for a little while and makes you feel good.  Kind of like a drug without adverse after-affects. A catalyst in the field of computer animation; This was the first feature film that was done entirely by computers, and Pixar couldn't have done a better job. Not only is this movie hilarious, touching, and well plotted, but it lead the way for every other computer animated movie, and really set the bar high. If this movie had completely bombed there would no more, or at least not as many, CGI films and we would still be seeing drawn animation. Not to mention that the absolute perfect voice talents were cast to make such a memorable movie for kids and adults and teens and preteens and seniors and new borns or anybody else who eyes and hears or either or. This movie can not me avoided and is a cultural landmark that has opened the door for a completely new genre of movie making. My favorite film as a kid and remains a classic today; As a kid, I remember watching the first two Toy Story films frequently and collecting all the characters from the movie. I found out that it was the very first computer-animated film about two years ago and assumed that's why the movie is still so popular. Woody and Buzz are what made the film what it was then and today and were my favorite characters. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is where Woody and Buzz are launched in the air from the rocket and Buzz frees himself to fly into Andy's toy box. The film remains a classic and always will be to me. I also cannot wait for the third movie to come out June 18, 2010 because I'll be the first in line. Toy Story is the greatest Disney movie ever in my opinion! Looking forward to Toy Story 3 in two years!; There is absolutely no question about it, Disney/Pixar's 1995 hit film, Toy Story, is their absolutely best film in my opinion. Pixar, the visual effects studio based in Northern California, was best known for making short films with three dimensional technology, including some Oscar winning shorts. In 1992 a script called Toy Story was completed and Pixar decided to take on the challenge of creating the world's first fully computer animated motion picture. In 1995, that script came to life, and the rest is history. Not only was Toy Story a gigantic hit for Disney and Pixar, it started series of films that continues to amaze and bewilder children and adults of all ages. The animation was state of the art, and continues to look amazing to this day. The characters, Woody, and Buzz Lightyear, to the humor were all amazing. Pixar won a special Oscar for making the first computer animated film, and it led to many more films of it's type to this day. Pixar, don't make us wait, please give millions of children around the world what we desperately need, more adventures of Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Here's to many more Toy Story films in the future, including the upcoming Toy Story 3 coming in three years, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen returning as Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Why the trailer, why?; I remember seeing all the trailers for this movie and thinking, \"Uggh, how stupid.  Why do they make movies like this?\"  This was when I was in my macho mood.  Ya know, I've outgrown all this animated c%^p.  That was my attitude, so, of course, I avoided this movie for 4 years.  Just last year, Pokemon kinda broke me out of my \"macho mode\" and brought me back to those simple pleasures.  Taught me not to hide the child in me.  So, my mom says we're taking care of my little cousin and wants to know if there's a movie out that we could see.  I mentioned Toy Story 2 (he and I already saw Pokemon, the most underrated movie of '99), but hadn't seen the first one.  So, I drove over to his house to watch Toy Story.  Man, what I was missing.  This is a terrific movie, but not because of the great animation.  The animation is cool, but like I've said, don't be that superficial that you judge the movies completely on animation.  It's the characters that matter, and this one had great characters.  Something that everyone must see. The Best Kids Movie of the 90's; Despite being the first full-length computer-animated movie, the movie's strengths are its plot and characterization.  The technology is not thrust in your face and simply serves to support a truly excellent animated film. A classic. Cool A MUST see; I saw this movie when i was 5 years old a long time ago and I was so obsessed with Buzz Lightyear! I had toys of buzz Lightyear and carried them around anywhere i went.I saw this movie yesterday again and it was fabulous! plain fabulous. The story was amazing and the characters were well made! Nice job Pixar, You done it again! Tom Hanks did well doing a voice of Woody and same with Tim Allen with Buzz. I didn't really like Wall.E i almost fell asleep but this movie kept me awake the whole time with excitement! I recommend this movie to anyone no matter what age you are because this movie Just Beautiful! An fantastic awesome 10/10 very good songs; this has some of my favourite songs ever to be used for an animated film: Strange Things and You've Got a Friend in Need. the songs makes this now dated(!) film more original than Toy Story 2. The animation is fantastic and cutting-edge at the time. Also, it's only 6 years old now, the animation is still as impressive as it was back all those year ago. What else can I say. But this is 1990s equivalent to Snow White and the 7 dwarfs and,indeed, a lot better! Absolutely Love Toy Story!; Toy Story is an incredibly creative, fun film with a touching, heartfelt story. It is an awesome family film. The characters were brilliantly personified as they worked their way through their amazing adventures. The brilliant creativity of the characters and background layout is evident throughout the entire film; the background layout and lighting is fantastic. Each character has it's own vivid personality that was expressed with such unique individualism, additionally each character makes the viewer care for them. The story's continuity is definitely balanced with the awesome visual effects. The movie keeps the viewers' attention throughout it's entirety, with the twists, turns and suspenseful predicaments. The film also lends fun filled moments with many jokes/funny lines and expressions from the characters, while simultaneously allowing the viewers' hearts to reach out to the characters as they are tangled in many of the zany situations they encounter.

It's a very cute movie, mainly for kids, but it has a few chuckles thrown in for adults. The human characters in the movie didn't seem very realistic; their happy-go-lucky, suburban lifestyle just made them very flat and barely likable, especially if you grew up in a family unable to afford multiple toys. The voice actors were delightful, and their moods were directed very well, even for the plastic Army-men who don't show much emotion. The \"cannibal toys\" were very imaginative and creepy, so they served their purpose well. I thought the idea of the claw machine that housed the little green aliens was cute, how \"The Claw\" was their Messiah of sorts. The coloring in the film was vivid and incorporated some awesome day-glow tones that I had forgotten about over time. The ultimate reason to watch the movie is to witness Pixar's astounding use of 3D imagery, especially when they incorporate real-life effects onto the screen (i.e. The magnifying lens over Woody's face). There were some aspects of the film I didn't care for. The movie is only 77 minutes long without the prefaced, short 3D movie before it, making the story suffer and seem a little lacking. I found the music to be over-the-top schmaltzy and generic, but it is primarily for kids and the Disney crowd, so I guess it belongs here. Again, the character of Andy isn't very likable, other than the fact that he owns a lot of older toys that we made have seen commercials of as a kid. The story wasn't very mind-blowing, but from the vantage point of a toy on the run, it is imaginative enough. It's the typical Indiana Jones setting where the main characters always find a way to turn their two-steps forward into one-step back. The ending with the falling through the sunroof was very convenient and could've easily been the start of another obstacle they needed to face, for example. In the end, I like the movie for its presentation, but as a film, I was not blown away with originality or anything by its story. The messages that it sends about jealousy, envy, depression, fear, and questions about one's worthiness to another are the primary focuses throughout the movie, but it ends up just being another nicely tied-up package in the end, which is Disney for you. 5 stars. Created a decade ago, but still stunning; I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago. The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their \"leader\" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other... When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10. very funny; a great movie to watch with your children. this is a movie the whole family will enjoy. we watch this movie over and over. our thirteen year old likes it as much as my three year old, i like it just as much as they do. Tears....; Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library. \"I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films.\"; Toy Story  5/5 stars Children play with toys. It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc",
       " But what if toys were real? What if they could talk? Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, 'Toy Story,' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks). Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy's birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one? I'll give you a hint: 'Cheers'). But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid's house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy's house safely. 'Toy Story' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in 'Toy Story,' filling our minds with endless possibilities. What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn't just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar managed to preach to us 'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film 'Toy Story.' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real? What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities? An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you've got yourself one of the best films ever. Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll's expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good. The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy). The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing. I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had. Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made  something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.' 'Toy Story' 1 &amp; 2 are both on my 'favorite films' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would 'Monsters Inc.' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar's upcoming film 'Finding Nemo,' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films  not sequels  by 2005), they should definitely try to make a 'Toy Story 3.' I'll be first in line for it, anyway. Cute Family Movie; Toy Story is a great movie for children and adults. Children will enjoy it simply because it is a cartoon. They will find it exciting because it shows toys coming to life which is something every child pretends with their toys. It's a good movie for children because it teaches them about jealousy, friendship, and teamwork. Adults will appreciate the animation and the accuracy of the details in the toys. Most of the toys used in this film were ones most people had as children. Such as, Mr. Potato head, the slinky dog, etch-a-sketch, and the army men. The theme of Toy Story is friendship. The movies theme song was titled \"You've Got a Friend in Me\". The friendship in this movie is about overlooking insecurities and finding a true friend in someone that you think would be your biggest enemy. A 2001 movie called Monsters Inc. is directed around this same theme. A little girl named Boo should be afraid of the monsters as much as the monsters are afraid of her but they form a friendship that overcomes their differences. Toy Story is about the lives of toys owned by a boy named Andy. Andy is having a birthday and he gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear. Andy's toys worry about him getting new toys because they are afraid they will get lost or donated. With the arrival of Buzz, Woody fills that Andy will like Buzz better. He tries to lose Buzz but instead he accidentally knocks him out of a window. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were brilliantly matched for being the voices of Woody and Buzz Lightyear. The personalities of the actors and characters seemed to be a perfect fit. The other toys in the movie, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky dog (Jim Varney), Pig named Ham(John Ratzenberger), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), and Bo Peep(Annie Potts), feel like Woody did this on purpose because he was jealous of the attention Buzz was getting from Andy. In order to make things right Woody realizes he needs to get Buzz back. Woody and Buzz both wind up separated from Andy and this is where their adventure begins. From this point on they work together to get back to Andy's before his family moves. Along the way Buzz realizes that he is not a space ranger but a toy. Woody tries to help Buzz understand that he is not just a toy and that he is very important to children. Woody convinces Buzz that they must get back to Andy. At the conclusion of the movie, Buzz and Woody are helping each other make it on the moving truck. They finally make it next to Andy who is excited to see both of them. Toy Story is about the friendship that is formed between Woody and Buzz. Once Woody was able to get passed his insecurities he realized that Andy could have two favorite toys. The motif of friendship is displayed throughout the movie by the relationships between Woody and Andy, Woody and all the other toys, and between Woody and Buzz. They also form a friendship with the strange toys at Sid's house. This movie is a true example of friendship. A Monumental Achievement in the Cinema; \"Toy Story\" is a real sight to behold because it is the first feature-length, computer-animated film.  Once you get passed the amazing visual effects, you see a really great film that works because of interesting characters and a second-to-none screenplay.  Even the roughest of critics would have trouble finding problems with this winner.  5 stars out of 5. Revolutionary. A fierce work of genius.; I don't necessarily like G-rated movies, but I make this one an exception. This movie is just great (it was the biggest moneymaker of 1995, and rightly so). I think that \"Toy Story\" appeals to kids and adults alike 'cause it's so funny, fast, and exhilarating. No one had done anything like this before; it was such a huge earthquake in the movie industry. It was also the world's first completely CG-animated movie. I can especially identify with Rex 'cause we're both nervous at times (except it's not from an inferiority complex), and we both like video games. This is easily one of my most favorite movies. \"An instant classic for all ages\". Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie; I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about. Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys. The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys. Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film. What a movie; Wow, I remember back in 1995 when I first saw this movie back in 1995. I think it was the movie being the farthest away that I could remember in theaters, and I saw it like two or three times. At first, I thought it was something about these toys trying to get to another group of toys, and they were a big group themselves. I couldn't believe how amazing the plot was. After I saw that movie it was like I couldn't get enough of Toy Story stuff. The characters were cool as well, and they just all seemed to be in the right places at the right time, like Mr. Potato Head, especially. And I had waited for years for a Toy Story 2 to come out, and after four years of waiting, it finally happened! And it was an excellent sequel! The extra fun in this movie, spotting the other toys that make cameos. It was kind of a simple plot that just worked, what with the rivalry between Woody and Buzz competing for Andy's favorite toy and the wisecracks of that pig, and Rex. I even got my own TS toys and such. It was truly a memorable movie. 10/10. Nice work, Disney and Pixar! Classic Pixar! This is what future Pixar films should be like!; Remember the original Pixar movies? Remember when Pixar didn't have stereotypical surfers and rappers? It was when the characters were fun and familiar. They didn't waste out time with farting jokes, but instead had smart jokes that weren't overdone. (even if they were more geared towards adults.) Luckily, we still have one good, classic Pixar movie; Toy Story. Peter Doctor knows how to make a fun and enjoyable family movie. Woody, is the \"top toy\" of Andy's bedroom. He leads meeting and events, and is one of the most popular toys there. But, then, Andy has a birthday party. Everybody is worried about getting replaced by a toy, but Woody assures them that there is nothing to be worried about. Funny, how he ends up getting replaced by Buzz Lightyear-the new popular toy. Ironic, huh? So, he gets jealous and tries to kill Buzz, by setting up a trap and pushing him out the window. Then, the other toys find out, and think \"Let's kill Woody!\" Wow, the irony in it all! The only way the toys will forgive him, is if he brings Buzz back. So, Woody and Buzz meet up at \"Pizza Palace.\" After exploring a bit, they get caught by Sid-the sick and twisted kid next door. But, what makes this movie so good? Toy Story isn't your average kids' film. It seems to have a message in it all. Two unlikely friends, Buzz and Woody hate each other at first. Then, they slowly learn trust each other, and stick together through thick and thin. Toy Story is perhaps one of those \"feel good\" movies. It's fun, and doesn't try to be anything it's not. Toy Story is an enjoyable, fun, and all-around excellent film. Be sure to put it on your \"To Watch\" list. 10/10 1995: Oh my God, is this real? 2016: Oh my God, what am I looking at?; Toy Story, as the first completely CGI animated movie, is still timeless in plenty of ways and is enjoyed by anyone who can say they like animation. I am one of them. The animation is of course crude by today's standards, but it was made in a way that makes it seem like 1995 wasn't that long ago. As dated as it looks, we can still appreciate it for being more than just a test of what computers could render. As for complaints, the jokes could have been funnier and the story could have less instances of convenience, like how Buzz and Woody enter the Pizza Planet Truck and come across a nice, high pile of pizza boxes to hide behind. There were also some errors in the anatomy of some toys, like RC. I won't take points off for the animation because hey, it was 1995 and Pixar had up to that point only been making shorts for 11 years, so it isn't something to grouch over (even though there were some superficial glitches like disappearing lights between scenes). All I can say is, see it soon and brace for a higher intrigue of the early history of CGI. Instant Classic; Every company has that one movie that puts them on the map. That is what Toy Story did for Pixar. Toy Story is a cartoon about a little boy's toy collection that is alive when the little boy is not around. His name is Andy and he loves his toys, and they love him back. Woody is a cowboy and is Andy's favorite toy. The toys always get worried every Christmas and birthday because they fear they will be replaced by a bigger and better toy. The story starts off with Andy's birthday party and all of the toys are on edge. It turns out that a new toy by the name of Buzz Lightyear challenges Woody as the favorite toy. Buzz comes along, steals a little bit of the spotlight and Woody gets incredibly jealous. Eventually Woody and Buzz get lost and must find their way home and back to Andy before he and his family move away forever. Let's start with the toys. I loved these toys. Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Little Bow Peep, Woody, Buzz, Slink, Ham, and even Etch-a-Sketch are the main toys and each are lovable and different. Rex is hilarious because he is ironic. He is a dinosaur but he is a wimp, and he is my favorite of the toys. I remember watching as a little kid and I was always excited to see Rex on screen. Each character has their individual role. There are also toys every kid can relate with and that make the movie special. For example, the barrel of monkeys, the small soldiers, the etch-a-sketch, and Mr. Potato Head are toys every kid used to play with. The smaller toys aren't really relevant for long but when they are seen in the beginning and end of the movie their impact is huge. One of the major themes in the story is jealousy and the relationship between Woody and Buzz. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the favorite toy. Woody is a cowboy with a pull string that says some catch phrases. The other toys look up to him, he is a hero, and Andy loved him with all his heart. Andy dresses up like a cowboy, has Woody posters, and is obsessed with this toy. Woody embraces the love; it defines him, gives him confidence, and confirms that he is the leader. Then Buzz Lightyear comes into the picture with his better quality of a toy. He doesn't have a pull string, but a button Andy presses to have a better sound quality voice box will speak catch phrases. He is made of plastic, which is more durable and he has wings pop out which can simulate flight. Woody becomes incredibly jealous of Buzz and fights for Andy's love. He eventually knocks him out the window. Toy Story may be a kid's movie but it has an interesting and entertaining premise, especially with its characterization. Woody and Buzz both develop into better and stronger characters. Woody goes from a pompous, jealous, selfish, toy, into a respectable and lovable character. He and Buzz become best friends and inseparable, a little cliché, but it's a movie for families so it's perfect. When Buzz first appeared he thought he was a real \"space ranger.\" He was convinced that he was not a toy, he could really fly, and he had a dangerous \"laser\" which was really a blinking light bulb. He develops and he eventually accepts the fact that he is a toy but he is a \"cool toy.\" He is \"Andy's toy.\" Woody admits his jealousy to Buzz and that becomes a turning point in their relationship. We have our villain in the movie, Sid. This kid is just evil. He is a spoiled kid who \"terrorizes toys, just for fun.\" One scene we the toys in Andy's room watch him as he straps firecrackers to a Commander Carl and it explodes. First of all, what kind of nine or ten year old kid plays with explosives? If he isn't nine or ten, what is he doing playing with kid toys? He may tear them apart and put different parts on them, making them scary and horrific for children to even see on screen, that just doesn't make sense. His character fits for a children's movie but in reality a kid like this would never exist in real life. Sid is really my only problem with the movie, but still a character needed for the film. Overall, Toy Story is a classic and put Pixar on the map and was the beginning of a highly successful company. It came out in the 1995 and families everywhere fell in love, including me. It is a movie that can be watched again and again no matter what age. It is a movie kids will show their children when they are older. Teenagers lined up to see Toy Story 3 years later because it meant so much to them back when they were little. Toy Story and its characters left a rare imprint on the hearts of people all over the world. Without a doubt, Toy Story gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and goes down as one of my personal all time favorite animation movies. Review; Disney and Pixar team up to create Disney's first full-length computer animated cinematic masterpiece, Toy story. Made in 1995, Toy Story was a marking point in movie history not only for its computer animation, but also having a timeless story full of witty characters and adventures. Toy Story is set in a suburban like neighborhood following an ensemble group of toys. Toys have human like abilities and personalities, but are forced to hide them from their human companions for the sake of being a toy. The main group of toys include a cowboy action figure, a piggy bank, a plastic dinosaur, a Mr. Potato Head as well as many more, all of whom live under their owner, Andy. The movie opens with Andy's birthday, which means receiving new toys to accompany old ones. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, is Andy's favorite action figure and also the group's leader. Woody and his fellow toy friends are somewhat threatened but also enthralled by this event. After a short time of announcing what Andy received, the toys are relieved to find that Andy did not receive any new toys. They were in for a surprise. Little did they know that there was a surprise toy on Andy's bed. It was the newest and coolest toy on the market, Buzz Light-year, a space orientated action figure voiced by Tim Allen who turns out to be Andy's next favorite toy. The strange thing about Buzz is that he believes that he is an actual space alien fighter. The toys try to convince Buzz that he is a mere toy only to be favored by Andy. Since Buzz believes he is actually a space fighter this leads into leaving the house and begin his journey to outer space. This ultimately pursues Woody to go and save his rival while getting tied up in a wacky adventure. There is a reason why this film acquired nineteen awards and ten nominations. Both adults and children will be entertained with the concept of living toys. The plot of the movie is really where it shines. There isn't one point in Toy Story where the plot gets boring or dragged out. People at Disney's Pixar developed the characters so well that it makes you understand how characters behave. Also, with a movie with so many diverse characters the audience is bound to find someone relate to. The only downside about seeing this movie is its length. It is around eighty minutes but it seems like the movie is about two hours, but that doesn't mean it isn't a full price movie because it is absolutely worth your time. Toy Story is definitely recommended to all families and especially kids. As for everyone else as an audience, I would recommend the movie if you would like to revisit your child hood or if you just want to see a beautifully animated movie. Whoever the audience may be, Toy Story will put a smile on your face. Toy Story is a classic beyond all means. It has stunning visuals, a crazy plot, deep character development, and most importantly it brings people back to a time when nothing mattered except toys. The most inspiring aspect of the movie is the moral of friendship. It really teaches people that they can't get anywhere in life without companionship. Toy Story also really captured the thought of \"what if toys were alive\" and executed it in a witty way. This movie will definitely be playing on family TV screens till \"Infinity and Beyond\"! Great fun for everyone; I just watched this movie for the first time since I was 12 (I'm 24 now). A lot of times when I view films I liked as a child, my perspective as an adult changes, by either noticing how little effort was put into certain films, or just that storyline/quality isn't there. Toy Story does not do this. As the first fully CG film, the detail I must say is fantastic and quite smooth. There is subtle adult humor in there that no child will be able to pick up, which makes this a great family flick, since both adults and children can enjoy it. The plot is original and quite interesting. And too anybody who ever lost a \"Toy\" as a child, sometimes you may wonder, if they got up on their own and walked away. It's sad that now and days, family films/kids films don't focus as much on story and dilogue like they used too and things just become a jumbled mess or completely juvenile. This film has quality story, dilogue and voice acting. And unlike a lot of other Disney movies which portray violence and some direct indendendo, this takes a lighter comedic side and it's a refreshing change from some films prior to it and even things made till this day. With that it also displays human emotions (Exaggerated of course for what they toys are feeling) But none the less, displays the essence of feeling replaced, or trying to be something you want to be,without having the means to do so. I highly reccemmend this to anybody who hasn't seen it yet. If you're and adult, don't be turned off by the CG animation. It's not by any means like a cartoon. The best film for small children....; My toddler has been watching this film for about 3 months, and I'm not sick of it and neither is she. It doesn't scare her, and it's teaching her about imagination, friendship, and kindness. All the performances are top notch, and the script is phenomenal. Any movie that has \"Wind the Frog!\" as a line , has to be a classic. The virtual world that has been created is remarkable in itself, but is equally partnered with a wonderful script. The song's compliment and impart in-depth character and plot points and Woody's personal journey is a lesson for all. I never really thought this was the best movie...; Toy Story is a good movie. It has good characters and a decent story. But is it really worth the hype? Yes, it's the first fully computer animated movie ever made and that's very impressive. For that reason alone, it will stand out in history. But I certainly never really thought it was the brilliant classic everyone else thought it was. Its animation is great but the story suffers from major pacing issues. There are entire moments of the movie right in the middle that bore me every time and don't stop boring me until I get to the film's climax, when it picks up again. A lot of trimming should have been done in the middle. Toy Story is good but its sequels are a lot better. So is it bad? No. But it's not brilliant. If this were 2-D, I doubt it would receive this high praise. Best Pixar movie to date!; Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (\"I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout\"). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox. this movie is awesome!the humor never bores!; i remember when this movie came out in 1995. i was seven at the time. i have loved it since day 1. actors such as tom hanks and tim allen bring sparkle to the show. they are both hillarious as woody and buzz. this movie is directed at both kids and adults. the humor never goes flat and it is never cheesy or corny. if you are a fan of tom hanks and tim allen or you just want a good laugh, than you shoud definitely watch this movie. you will not regret it. ********** out of **********. Loved It 10 Stars! Great Disney Movie!; Im 14 Years Old And I Saw Toy Story When I Was 10 Years Old I Loved It And I Still Do Today! Toy Story Is About Buzz And Woody And The Rest Of The Toy Gang Trying To Save Buzz From The Evil Sid! Very Good Movie! With The Voices Of Tim Allan (Home Inprovment) Tom Hanks (Forest Gump) And Don Rickles (Classc Tv Star) And Jim Varney (Ernest) -Jeremy One of the very best animation movies; TOY STORY stands on totally own feet! Having the sequel released after this, the TOY STORY became quickly a high status animation movie. In this first movie we get to know Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Potato Head and all the others, and I tell you; it's so jolly good entertainment! Seeing things from a toys perspective, is really fascinating and really cool, having stairs as a huge mountain and a aggressive dog is the Devil itself! TOY STORY starts off very wity, and although the movie gets darker and more exciting, it always has this extremely charming and wity undertone. I laughed jolly loud, and it is such a pro made movie that it's already a classic. STARS; 5/5 I seen a movie quite like this one; I saw this movie was I was about 10 years old and I was captivated. This film was awesome. I watch it over and over again with my younger siblings and I enjoy it just as much as them. It's a great story and every time I watch it, it brings out the the kid in me. Tom Hanks was amazing as Woody. Tom Hanks is one of my heroes and he never seizes to amaze me. He really brings Woody to life and he fits the role perfectly. Toy Story has a really good, solid story line and amazing visuals, especially for 1995. Toy Story 2 was almost as amazing as this movie, but nothing's as good as the original. I heard that they're making a Toy Story 3 set to be released in 2008. I'm hoping the theater is packed, with different generations, appreciating how Toy Story is not a only a stunning film, but also an example of the best kind of art there is. An absolutely awesome motion picture. 100/10 Exciting; Toy story is a 1995 American computer-animated adventure buddy comedy film produced by Pixar Animetion Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures, directed by John Lasseter at his directorial debut. Toy story was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first theatrical film produced by Pixar. In the film, toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present. A group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy, are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother and his sister are preparing to move the following week. The toy's leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Woody organized the other toys. Andy gets an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear as a birthday present. He believes that he is an actual space ranger. What happen to Andy's toys next? The characters have individuality. The picture on the screen is colorful, so I think the film is very cute. I am excited because I think about what happen next and what Andy's toy do next. I love the film's view of the world. Everyone enjoys the film, regardless of age or sex. I want you to watch the film. Pixar's first full length movie.; This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back 10 years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies. Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only 7 when I first watched it in theaters). The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like \"Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc.\" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him. Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a \"Buzz Lightyear\" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys. Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more. I give it an 8/10 perfect movie for the whole family to watch. Four Dimensional Toybox; I see that my previous comment on this film was deleted. This is the thing that started it all: Pixar. Somewhat photorealistic modeling. Deep, deep attention to story dynamics. An animated feature not so polished since \"Snow White.\" Something worthy. Something that led to the reinvention of Disney. Its an iconic turning point, like \"Citizen Kane,\" \"2001,\" \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" Greenaway's \"Tempest.\" (and others) Many things after change. So it should be seen on its historical basis alone. Here already you can see that Pixar decides to combine goals. They want the movie to be just as good as the best non- animated movie. There is the well-documented attention to refining and refining the story dynamics so that the narrative spine simply works. That took years. What I mean by combined goals is that they also realized that they were presenting something relatively new in their three D modeling capability. So they wanted to have that new cinematic vocabulary enhance the narrative dynamics and vice versa. It is subtle here, not fully developed until \"Nemo.\" But its plain to see when pointed out: the camera simply moves in ways that a real one does not. There are a broader set of intimate and distanced observer perspectives. These are not overused, lest you notice them, but you can see that out tolerance and viewing skill has slowly evolved from this to the later Pixar projects. (At this writing, that is \"Wall-E.\") The business about family and desired roles are not \"the point\" as some would say, but strategies to explore this deeper narrative power. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching. Great Animation, Great Characters; This movie probably was the best kids' movie I've ever seen in my life. Its animation was superb and Tim Allen was very funny as the voice of Buzz Lightyear, an action figure who really thinks he is the space hero he's supposed to be. The rest of the characters also had great things to say. \"That's not flying, that's falling with style!\" was an unforgettable line. It was a great movie.; This was, and still is, a great movie. It was amazing how the toys sort of live a double life, behaving like humans when no one's looking. I loved how all the toys are like a big family, with Woody being like a leader. As for Buzz Lightyear, I thought he was going to be really tall, but it turns out, he's shorter than he appeared. It was hilarious how Buzz believed he was a \"space ranger\". Also, Woody and Buzz sort of reminded me of Tawni and Sonny from the show Sonny With a Chance when they first met. Both Buzz and Sonny were \"the new kid\" who got accepted by almost everyone, and both Woody and Tawni were the only one who didn't accept the \"new kid\" and got jealous (but eventually learned to accept the \"new kid\"). So now, when I watch this movie, I think of the first episode of Sonny With a Chance. Best of the pixar movies; I am a big fan of all of Pixars movies and have seen all of them at the cinema, however for me this stands head and shoulders above the rest (including this years brilliant WallE). I watched it again recently and despite my age was pissing myself with laughter. This is mainly down to the characters who are so fresh. The banter between woody and Buzz is terrific (\"YOU ARE A TOY!!!\") and the other characters are also brilliant, especially ,for me, the bitter, angry and cynical Mr potato head , who lends a slightly darker more adult edge to this film compared to the Pixar movies to come ,as well as Sid his dog and the mutilated toys he has created. It is after all the only pixar movie rated parental guidance, i think which lets the emotions of the characters be more human in the shape of jealousy, pride and competitiveness. The central ideas of toys being alive when you cant see them is probably their best idea to date just in sheer amount of imagination and the amount of opportunity and possibility it creates (their is after all a sequel) and does kind of become a template for later. This definitely provided a lifeline for Disney who had seriously passed its golden age, and were starting to lose their reputation of quality and connection with its younger and older audience. With Lasseter moving to head of creative output at Disney, hopefully he will put them back on track also. (By the way I noticed a lack of any fathers in it, I don't know if thats meant to be read into) Fantastically Enjoyable Classic; Toy Story is about an old cowboy doll's jealousy toward a new spaceman toy, and the trouble it gets them into. The movie is a joy to watch, with a witty script jam-packed with hilarious gags and funny lines, wrapped up in an engaging, adventure-type plot. It's filled with appealing characters, voiced by an extraordinary cast. Tom Hanks as the cowboy and Tim Allen as the spaceman fit their roles perfectly, backed up by the amusing support of R. Lee Ermy, Jim Varney, and John Ratzenberger. The story does rely too much on coincidences (getting picked up by the next-door neighbor) and stereotypes (surfer-talking, reckless teenage pizza delivery guy), though. Contains: A Mild Comic Fight, Some Scary Images Toys come to life in this entertaining computer-animated film from Pixar...; It's only now, fifteen years after its release, that I decided to give TOY STORY a look on my large flat screen TV. I've never been a fan of computer animation per se, but this charming story has heart and wit and enough entertainment value for both young and old. The toy characters are both appealing and very funny in ways that anyone can appreciate, thanks to a clever script. Woody the Cowboy and Buzz Lightyear compete for the affections of a small boy, Andy, whose playroom is loaded with toys that come alive whenever anyone leaves the bedroom. Out of this fresh idea, the plot bounces along with supreme confidence as it races forward putting all of them in constant danger from their ever changing environment, especially when they leave the confines of Andy's home. Technically, the film is a marvel--everything simulated through computer wizardry, all of it invented with taste for artistry evident in every frame of the film--the kind of artistry that the Walt Disney studio demonstrated during the heyday of their cartoon wizardry. The brilliant colors look even more amazing in the good print of the film that aired on cable tonight. Well worth watching for pure family entertainment, a rarity nowadays. Pixar First Feature is an Instant Classic; Pixar's long line of success began in 1993 with TOY STORY, the first in a series of highly successful CG family films. Pixar had the formula nailed from the start, creating a fun kid's film with a powerful story capable of entertaining adults. In the film, we're introduced to the world of Andy's room when no one's around and the toys come to life. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is a classic cowboy doll complete with a pull-string vocal box and reigns as young Andy's favorite toy. For his birthday, Andy receives a flashy new Buzz Lightyear action figure (voiced by Tim Allen) and Woody must cope with the fact that he may have been bumped from the top position. A botched attempt at lodging Buzz behind Andy's desk throws Buzz out into the real world and Woody must bring him back to regain the trust of the other toys. The fun of this kid's film lies in the characters. Allen is hilarious as Buzz and his inability to grasp that he's merely a child's toy and not an actual space ranger, spending half the film trying to return to Star Command; Hanks is a bit neurotic and totally high strung as Woody in his role as the toy-in-charge (going so far as to hold meetings on plastic erosion and establishing a buddy-system for moving day). The room is loaded with great supporting characters in the form of classic playthings from everyone's childhoods: a Slinky dog, a Mr. Potato Head, a piggy bank",
       "each with their own unique personalities. These characters are each fun enough to deserve their own movie and we're lucky to have been given the TOY STORY sequels to return to this world. I really enjoy the film overall (as do just about everyone I know who's seen it) and there is little to complain about. It's amazing to see how well the animation stands up after so many years. You can see that the computer graphics aren't as smooth as modern CG, but it's still near seamless. Pixar's first film is a classic I was happy to introduce to my daughter. Cynical and disturbing; This is one film that left me with a very sour aftertaste.  Yes, it's animated with character and vigour, and there are some fine -- if over the top -- voice performances.  However, there are some very disturbing aspects to the film.  The first is that it's like nothing so much as watching a 90 minute advert.  Even if merchandising hadn't been released to support the film, all the supporting cast could already by bought in your local toy shop.  I'm sure I wasn't the only viewer who found this more than a little suspect. Possible spoiler: The second, perhaps larger, point against the film lies in the characterisation of the two boys, Andy and Sid.  Andy is the \"good\" boy. He plays safely and passively with his toys, they don't do anything toys wouldn't do.  Sid, the \"bad\" boy is more creative.  He adapts toys to fit his own vision, he's an innovator, a creator.  It's this very creativity of his that is portrayed as a bad thing.  Sid isn't the ideal target audience for this film: he wouldn't be satisfied with row after row of identical shop-bought toys, he would much rather make his own.  I guess this review is being written for all the Sids out there, who are demonised and vilified by this ultra-corporate nightmare of a film. Wonderful Film One of Pixar's Best; I love animated Disney films, although I must say I usually prefer the original classic hand drawn Disney films, at some point we have to accept change, and what better way to accept this change with a wonderful superb film. (I mean common they booked Toy Story 4 already). Toy's come to life when their owner is asleep, and its all about the battle for who is the best and most popular toy. Whenever Christmas or the little boy's birthday come around the toys get nervous that they will be abandoned or replaced. When a new toy arrives they are determined to hate him and ignore him, but they end up becoming friends. It was a privilege witnessing this film-making achievement.; Pixar started with a big bang: Toy Story. I loved this film as a kid and all the more as an adult. Every moment in this film is memorable, great or small. Don't tell me you don't remember parts like Andy's playtime with Mr. Potatohead as the villain, that mosquito on Buzz's visor, Pizza Planet, or at least one of the twisted toys. The way the story is put together is simple yet clever. The characters are lovable and are all equally important to the story. I may not have realized back then that I was seeing the first cgi animated feature film but I am somewhat glad I didn't know about that. Having to enjoy the film sincerely is way better than that. It's still a privilege seeing this on it's original date. The Largest Part Of My Childhood Put On Screen.; With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. \"Toy Story\" was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises &amp; confidence. How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history. I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling &amp; technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals &amp; entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks &amp; Tim Allen, and almost immediately think \"Toy Story\". As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then. Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, \"Toy Story\" is that proof. 10/10. Great Fun For Kids And Adults Alike; Toy Story is one of those rare animated movies, designed for children, that adults can enjoy. Plot In A Paragraph: Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) is 8 year old Andy's favourite toy, however his world falls apart when Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) figure for his birthday and he has to play second fiddle to the new space ranger. I loved this movie. Over the years I have watched it with both my kids and nieces and nephews and they have all enjoyed it. Watching it now, it has lost none of its charm. Tom Hanks is superb as Woody, Tim Allen (who I'm not a fan of) is delightful as the deluded Buzz Lightyear who is not aware he is an action figure, but for me the stand out voice was John Ratzenberger as Pork Chop the Piggy Bank. simply a timeless classic; this movie is one of the best, if not the best animated movie i have ever seen. i have seen this feel so many times, and yet every time i see it is has the same magic as when i first saw it. i would strongly recommend this film to anyone that has a shred of taste. suitable for adults and children alike. there is nothing this film doesn't have. hilarious and sweet. the voice actors finish this movie off, and it will stay on your mind for a very long time. i have seen all of the pixar movies i can think of, and by far this stands out as the best. how anyone doesn't like this movie i don't know. such a simple story, that we all dreamt up when we were young, is captured in an incredible fashion. this movie simply would not work as well if it was normal cartoon. followed up by an equally good movie, it is easy to say that you will never see another movie that captures your childhood as well as this does the plot is simple, and never feels to simple or complicated. there is never a second where there is confusion, or there is not something that the audience will like. attention is captured and maintained. Technically impressive with great script and sharp wit; Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence. Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula. The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads. Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors.  Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz.  Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults. Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things! 4th best film of all time!; This is the first movie I ever saw. I grew up with this film and loved ever since I was little. A few movies surpass it, but every other film iv'e ever seen is inferior. This is one of the big ones. It takes a lot to live up to this film. Its one of the most popular films, if not the most popular film of all time! Tom Hanks and Tim Allen head the lead voice cast. A cowboy doll named Woody, whose been the favorite of his owner, Andy since he first got him, is in for it when he's replaced by the latest and hottest new toy, Buzz Lightyear, (Tim Allen). A few accidents here and there get them stranded in the middle of nowhere, causing them to team up to get back home. If the story isn't enough to pull you in, (which it should be anyway) then the beautiful animation, the brilliant voices, and the funny jokes will be more than enough. Of course, iv'e seen the movie so many times, I know about each scene and each fact of the movie by heart. Even after all these times watching it, I still manage to laugh at it a little. Everybody whose anybody has seen, or at least heard of this film. I don't know a single person who hasn't seen this. All I can say left is that its one of the greatest and touching films of all time. Except for a few other films, nothing passes this film! An Instant Classic!; After a few short films and no major recognition-in 1991, Pixar set out to start the ball rolling for computer-animated entertainment and in 1995 unleashed not just a mere film but a work of art. An instant classic when first released...Toy Story went on to earn nearly $400 million worldwide and capture the hearts of children and adults alike with its unforgettable characters, magical musical score, hilarious script and the classic quote \"To infinity and beyond\". Woody (Tom Hanks) is an old-fashioned pull - string cowboy doll living a life of luxury as the favourite toy of a young boy named Andy. Surrounded by a colourful cast of characters - such as the cynical Mr. Potato Head, the wisecracking Piggy bank Hamm and Woody's brown-nosing second-in-command Slinky Dog - Woody seems something of a king. However, when a new toy arrives on the scene-a high tech spaceman action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Woody suddenly loses his popularity. But this toy comes with a surreal extra feature - he thinks he's the real Buzz Lightyear!! In the effort of removing Buzz as Andy's favourite toy-both toys are swept out of their home, and into the outside world where they unite reluctantly in friendship for an adventure home. The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in 1937 lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Pixar begins; I recently went to see the double feature which included \"Toy Story\" and \"Toy Story 2\" and I don't know if it's the nostalgia kicking in but it was still quite fun. I mean it wasn't good as when I first saw it when it came out when I was in elementary school, but it was still pretty entertaining and brought back some memories. The animation was amazing, and phenomenal when it first came out and still holds up today. The voice actors even did a great job, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did a great job with there performance in portraying Woody and Buzz Lightyear. It was a exciting adventure, although the plot was simple it was effective and entertaining.The story is about toys coming to life, but keeping themselves secret by acting like they aren't alive. But the toys coexist with humans peacefully, except the toys in Andy's room get worried on birthdays and Christmases of being replaced. Thus when Andy's favorite toy get replaced by a new favorite toy, the conflict starts from there when the older toy that was Andy's favorite tries to hide the new toy, but ends up hitting it out the window. Although this day and age, kid's who are about Andy' age probably won't play with the types of toys portrayed in the movie, and the magic was sort of lost from when I saw it when I was in elementary. This movie is still ahead of it's time, by a large margin. 8.5/10 An amazing family film; Toy Story is a timeless classic. Probably the most genuine, innocent, simplistic yet powerful attempt to create a children film which appeals both adults and kids alike. It is the story of how two rival 'living' toys - a old western cowboy toy (Woody) and action figure of a space commander (Buzz Lightyear) become best friends under some dangerous circumstances. There are bunch of numerals toys like Mr. Potato, a Barbie, a magnifying toy, a truck, alien toys and many more. The film is crafted so well that within some few minutes of the film, you are intrigued to it. It is a fascinating film, with amazing characterization. The toys are so believable that you feel close to them. You feel cherished when Allan and his company make a spoiled brat kid Sid (who loves blowing up toys) realize how important is to save toys which bring back the memories of childhood. I must say the script is effortless and very well written. Music by Randy Newman is also great. One striking thing in this film are its sound effects and CGI which are considered ground-breaking for a 1995 film. Overall, the film is highly recommended. Not only for children, but for everyone who love cherishing the childhood memories - the lovely Toys. fantastic; Toy Story i think is a fantastic animated movie to watch. This movie was rated as a PG (Parental Guildence) This movie was made in 1995. This is fantastic to watch, i got to tell ya. It is an amazing animated movie. I give this movie 10 out of 10. As Good as It Gets!; What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It's a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can't really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the \"humanity\" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute. The movie that changed all animations that were to come; Even though there were other animation classics such as Lion King, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, no other animation movie, prior to this, had being a 3D Computer Animated Film making this one of the most ground-breaking films of all time. This movie is also unique in every sense. Even though the movie is targeted for children and is the movie that every single child watches during their child hood, its so good that even adults absolutely love it. The film follows the tale of Andy's toys who are, unknown to all humans, actually alive. During the movie, as Buzz, Andy's new toy comes, Sheriff Woody becomes jealous of Buzz as he becomes Andy's new favorite and attempts to put an end to it but Buzz gets his revenge. However, the two get captured by Sid, the evil kid next door that enjoys torturing toys and must try their best to escape. To be fair, this movie is one of the shortest films I've ever seen but also one of the most enjoyable. The voice acting for the film is just masterful. Tom Hanks voice acting of Woody is just brilliant and Tim Allen as Buzz was brilliant. The voice acting just added further strength to every aspect of the film. The animations for a 1995 film, being the first 3D animated film, is just visually amazing! Though it may not stand out against recent visual animations, this movie is just a joy to watch, even after 18 years! One thing that is incredibly cool is that they don't explain how exactly the toys ever were alive and its great to see such thing left anonymous. I also found the characters extremely entertaining and the way that Buzz and Woody become friends during the film is just well made! Also, having your main characters toys and in fact making a movie entirely based on toys can be some pain and something which people just laugh at but in this film, we as an audience are emotionally connected to these plastic toys! Its because, despite being toys, the director portrays these as human like things which makes it extremely interesting to us. The dialogue in the film is great and as a result it constantly made me laugh. I loved that little kid as a villain. I thought he was fascinating and I'm glad that very little time is spent about Andy. Despite being made for children all adults are sure to have a blast with this film. In fact, I don't see why nobody has yet to see this film. In case you haven't, be sure to remember that this film changed all animation films to come and that this is surely one of Pixar's ever most finest films! Simply, the best animated film of them all.; Disney used to be good, wholesome family entertainment that was not only clean but fun. Now, most everything they put out is outdated postmodern trash that portrays all children as geniuses able to rule the world and all parents as evil minions trying to keep their children from having fun. Thank God for Pixar coming to existence. Starting with Toy Story in 1995, they made a great family film that appeals to adult humor as well as children. They haven't failed since. They can do no wrong it seems, and I pray it continues that way. Of all their great films, this is undoubtedly in my mind the best of them all. It is also arguably better than any animated film Disney ever did, including the classics of the 1940s and 50s. The premise is so clever and daring in that it could go wrong in so many ways. It never does, though, and in a mere 82 minutes, it covers more information than many other 2 hour films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have become iconic in their roles as Woody and Buzz. The animation and dialogue is so good it is as if they are really on screen arguing with one another. The supporting characters are also very good and funny. With animation, perhaps the most important aspect is the voice characters. Pixar has done a great job of not always going with a star to do the voices, but rather simply going with the one that fits the character best. Overall, Toy Story is superb film-making with a great script, wonderful voices and animation that still impresses despite all the technological improvements. Thank you, Pixar. I am truly grateful to you for saving animated films. one of the best movies of 1995; toy story is another successful Disney 90s flick of the 90s followed by A goofy movie The lion king and inspector gadget 1 and the other 90s Disney movies this one is so outstanding its about toys that come to life when their owner is not looking and are feared about getting replaced if you can remember Johnson and friends the kids TV series where toys come to life and feared that they are going to be replace but that has nothing to do with this very successful movie I love this movie to bits its good fun and great for kids and adults too if you have toys in your room you night think they are alive trust me you can think of it so if you love Disney movies like A goofy movie Herbie the love bug The lion king or other very successful Disney movies from the 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s or the early 2000s then you will love this one its great to have for your Disney DVD or VHS sets. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 because people really love it. Brilliant, Simply Brilliant Film; Sometimes, just Sometimes, A Disney film is released and is made into a classic. Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, Bambi are just a few of the classics. But My all time fave Disney films are the ones made by Pixar. Toy Story, is my third favourite Disney Film. The story revolves around a toy cowboy called Woody (Tom Hanks, who does an excellent job)who is owned by Andy, a 4 year old boy. On Andy's birthday, he recieves a Buzz Lightyear action figure (Tim Allen, who does an unforgettable job as Buzz). Buzz slowly becomes Andy's favourite, leaving Woody Jealous, he schemes to purposely lose Buzz, but his plan backfires, leaving him and Buzz away from home. I won't reveal much else, but the Idea is so clever, well.. It's hard not to. This is an excellent film, 10/10 Rubbish movie, so many plot holes...; I don't understand why this film is so highly rated. The film has so many plot holes in it I actually lost count. Now before I start this review, I'm not going to say toys talking is a plot hole, the idea of them talking is interesting but it opens up so many other questions that the movie never really explains. Also, don't argue, \"it's a kids movie\", films need to make sense in order to work whether they're for kids or not. This film is so bad and here is why. Even if you like this film, you have to agree with some of the points I'm making here: Buzz thinks he's a space ranger. If that is the case then why does he allow Andy to play with him? Does he not think why is this giant kid picking me up and throwing me around? Buzz however makes no attempt to communicate with Andy. Surely Buzz would try and talk to him? This doesn't make sense given that Buzz doesn't believe he's a toy. Also when Woody hits a button that release Buzz's helmet and he gasps for air, you're telling me Andy never pushed that button? He's owned the toy for weeks yet hadn't pressed all the buttons? Rubbish. The end scene is one of the worst scenes for me. It's broad daylight and two toys are running down a street. Where are all the pedestrians on the street? How are they able to open the back of the moving van truck? Surely the driver would notice doesn't he check his rear view mirrors, or surely a button or signal would come up revealing that a door was open at the back of his truck? Wow any thief could steal from this useless driver. Also when Woody and Buzz fly down from the sky and land in Andy's car. Andy's car is directly in front of the truck driver, how could he possibly not see this??? The most hilarious scene though is when Woody is moving around in the middle of the road and a person in a car honks at him. Woody then ducks in front of the car as it drives over him. 1) Why would you sound your car horn if there was a toy in the road? 2) The driver therefore saw Woody as he sounded his horn. 3) He must have seen Woody moving about and be thrown from the moving van. Does this driver know toys are alive or something? Is it only kids who are unaware? I just don't understand. It's never fully explained. Continuing this point: when the toys all surround Woody and prepare to attack him after he knocks Buzz out the window, we hear Andy from outside shouting. This allows them to return into position. What if he hadn't have shouted though? He would have walked in and seen them. This is why this idea of toys coming to life could never work! No kid would always shout when they enter their room and most kids leave their doors open yet Andy never does - allowing the toys to move around and communicate. Once you take these plot holes into account, the conclusion is that the film sucks and is a really poor movie. Honestly how could anyone like it? An interesting idea that just falls flat. And also the final question that is never addressed is: Why can't toys reveal they're alive to humans??? It's never explained and I don't get why. Poor film 1 star. Awful. Classic Tale Full of Imagination; Toy Story (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) A kid's toy room is split after his former favorite toy Woody (Tom Hanks) gets replaced with the newest sensation Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). The gunslinger Woody can't except the fact that he's no longer the kid's favorite so he and Buzz end up outside of the house and must try and find a way back. The Pixar form of animation has become the standard today so I'm sure many people watching these films forget how groundbreaking this movie was when it was first released. I was only fifteen at the time but giving it a second viewing after all these years just reminds me at why this thing became a hit. Not only is the animation beautiful and extremely life like but we also got a terrific screenplay that certainly brings these characters to life and really makes them something special. The idea of a film being centered on toys that come to life when no one is looking is something so simple yet so genius that you can't help but wonder why it took someone so long to do a film. The screenplay is without question one of the best ever written for an animation movie as all of the characters, from Woody and Buzz to Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) are perfectly brought to life. The child-like nature of the story has so much energy that you can't help but smile at each journey that the toys find themselves on. The amount of imagination in the screenplay is what makes it so special because it really does seem like something a kid would come up with while playing alone in his room with the toys. Everyone can remember what it was like being a kid and playing with these toys and bringing them to life in our minds so to see that played out on the screen is certainly something special. The film has terrific laughs but also a nice message. The voice work is terrific with Hanks and Allen clearly leading the way but that Southern draw of Varney is special as well. TOY STORY was ground breaking when originally released and it comes as no shock that the film hasn't lost any of its impact. The screenplay with its great characters and story is guaranteed to be enjoyed for decades to come. Not just for children!; This is an awesome movie, and it's not just for kids! When I read this in the memorable quotes: Mr. Potato Head: How come you don't have a laser, Woody? Woody: It's not a laser! It's a little light that blinks! Hamm: What's wrong with him? Mr. Potato Head: Laser envy. I knew that this movie wasn't completely aimed at small children. But there were a few things that bothered me. How Andy plays with his toys so nicely, and Sid just takes apart toys and puts them together with other different parts. Isn't that a sign of creativity? Otherwise, this movie was great! Overall this movie gets a 9/10!!!</td>\n",

       "      <td>5 + 5 : « addictive and fun as a real game » (tv); I saw a little bit long ago and it seemed dull then. This time, i start another play right from the start and i found it still dull : the young boy appears a bit dumb, his wealthy family not better ",
       " And then, first comes teen Dunst and i'm really surprised how good she acted (as she never convinced me as Peter's girlfriend). Next, Robin gets in the movie getting out the game and the magic operates : i really like the way past, present and future merge, how the game expands to the big mansion into town. If the special effects looks very tired, the story is original, full of surprises and proves that a humble cast can do as fine as a multiple billion dollars one ! Robin proved one more time he was a never grown-up kid with a beautiful soul with kids and the key to childish fun ! So i had a great time with this small movie as it gives me all i ask to cinema : to find a way to leave (cautiously) my world behind !! Probably worth checking out, even today; There is a lot to like in this movie. The concept was intriguing. Robin Williams plays a basic Robin Williams character, i.e. a man-child. I never would have recognized Kirsten Dunst or Laura Bell Bradley as children without the cast list, but they both performed well. David Alan Grier did befuddlement just as well back then as he does now. Bebe Neuwirth and Bonnie Hunt did nicely, and looked very nice as well. The pace got a bit frenetic for me, though I understand that this was deliberate. The CGI animals looked fine in the distance but up close, not so much. I know we are spoiled by the unlimited effects in films today, but some of these, like the lion, looked terrible. I saw in the credits that they had Industrial Light &amp; Magic, so I doubt it could have been done any better at the time. And some of the things in the ending did not seem to totally follow from the body of the film. It's probably worth checking out though, even today. Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Almost 20 years on and it's still entertaining kids of all ages; Jumanji was on TV today, and my 8 year old son had liked him in \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and I remembered it being fun, so with sweets and crisps we sat down to watch it. Orphans Judy (A young Kristen Dunst, who had started in \"An Interview With A Vampire\" the previous year, but still a few years away from Spiderman fame) and Peter move in to a mansion with their Aunt (Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers) where the find a board game called Jumanji. When they start playing, they free Alan Parish (Robin Williams) who was trapped in the game when he was a child. Robin Williams is always fun to watch and he was very popular at the time, due to movies like \"Aladdin\" and \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and Kristen Dunst was a real talent as a young actress, none of the annoying traits of usual child actors. Of the supporting cast David Alan Grier is fun as a hapless Police Officer, as is Jonathan Hyde in duel roles as a hunter and young Alan's Dad. Defo worth checking out if you have kids, and more than enjoyable even if you don't. Some of the special effects have dated badly, but are still OK, most of the humour is spot on too. My son got a big kick out if it and really enjoyed it. And I thought for a 19 year old special effects laden kids movie it had held up pretty well. review for jumanji.; This 1995 film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game 26 years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are 8+ as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than 8 and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark wild CGI destruction gets repetitive; In 1869, two boys bury a mysterious dangerous wooden chest. In 1969 Brantford, New Hampshire, young Alan Parrish gets picked on by bullies. He finds the box in a local construction site. He opens the chest to find a board game Jumanji. His father is sending him to boarding school. He is about to run away when his best friend Sarah Whittle comes by. They play the game and Alan is pulled into the board game. Twenty six years later, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) buys the rundown mansion planning to open a bed-and-breakfast. She brings her niece Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter (Bradley Pierce) who lost their parents in a car accident. The kids find the board game in the attic and start playing it. Alan (Robin Williams) is released. They track down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) to finish the game and bring all the released apparitions to an end. Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) was a friend who worked at Alan's shoe factory and is now a cop. The game brings out big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) who looks like Alan's father Sam. The basic idea of a board game that comes alive is one with great possibilities. I wish that it is more than just a series of crazy CGI destruction. I wish that the players needed to use their brain power to solve clues. The constant escaping from one thing to the next gets a little bit repetitive. They start piling on top of one another. Williams is not quite as lovable as expected. Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier are kind of fun. There is an uncontrolled quality to this children's movie. once it gets going it's pretty darn fun; i have t say,this movie started out pretty slow,and i thought it was gonna be a dud.i'm glad i kept watching.it turned into a pretty good movie.if you're into action and adventure,you'll certainly find it in abundance here.there are some great action sequences,providing scads of excitement.but there are also a lot of very funny moments,and there's even a hint or 2 of romance.there are some fantastic creatures here.the only downside i can think of is the visual effects.i found them kinda cheesy,and sometimes they didn't quite look real.the creatures sometimes looked a bit wonky,but other times were pretty realistic.but that's a small downside,since the movie is so much fun.Robin Williams is the featured performer here,but i thought Bonnie Hunt was terrific.Bebe Neuwirth was very good as well.but David Alan Grier was a riot.Kirsten Dunst was good too.overall, this is a good movie for both kids and adults.for me,Jumani is a 7/10 Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. Watchable Effects-laden family entertainer, though a bit predictable; This is a watchable family entertainer with some genuine scares. The plot appears complicated but is actually fairly simple. Hordes of wild animals appear and people flee. This happens again and again like clockwork throughout the film making it predictable after a while. On the plus side, Robin Williams is in manic form, and the Special Effects are agreeable though dated. Kirsten Dunst is very appealing in one of her earlier films. This is generally a pleasant watch, but on the whole, I prefer the newer film Zathura, which is also based on a board game. Overall 6/10 Still great to this day.; \"Jumanji\" is still fun to watch, it's an original story and has great performances, directing and dialogue. The film score composed by James Horner is fantastic. The special effects are damn good for it's day. There's no need for a sequel/reboot/remake or whatever the hell it is, it's cheapened this 90s classic. If they want to be respectful then leave this movie alone, stop trying to recreate something that won't work! Almost Thoroughly Enjoyable; If I had been 10 or 12 when this movie came out it would probably be my favorite.  As I was 34, my first reaction was that there was too much screaming. But there's much here for an imaginative youngster (or oldster) to enjoy.  The script is generally witty, and except for the screaming, parents will not be bored watching it -- and if they squint their minds eyes enough to remember what they enjoyed before puberty, they'll get a nostalgic rush. This is everything family entertainment should be.  And though it does involve the supernatural, it is presented in a negative light and none of the characters relish being part of it. Dated, but fun adventure for kids and adults alike; When Steven Spielberg launched 'Jurassic Park' in the summer of 1993, it broke major grounds in the visual effects department leaving everyone with their jaw dropping at the splendid computer-generated imagery of the dinosaurs. The success of the Spielberg brought birth to a new image of computer-generated effects as well special effects to the feast the eyes of viewers everywhere. This fantasy adventure based on the Award-winning children's book Jumanji by Chris Van Allsburg invites audiences for fun adventure in the jungle with computer-generated animals that hit a mark in the state-of-the-art territory at the time of its release, but unlike the superior Jurassic Park sadly look dated and unauthentic by comparison. That is certainly not to say however, that the fun of the magical fantasy excursion and the charm of the highly popular Robin Williams no longer remains. Set in 1995, the film follows a young boy named Peter Shepard (played by Bradley Pierce) and his sister Judy (played by Kirsten Dunst) who discover a mysterious game in the attic of the home 12-year old Alan Parrish (played by Adam-Hann Byrd) disappeared in twenty-six years ago. Upon rolling the dice, Peter and Judy unexpectedly release a thirty-something year old Alan (played by Robin Williams) who reveals to have disappeared into the game. Witnessing the magical powers of the game, Alan, Peter, and Judy team up along with Alan's old friend Sarah (played by Bonnie Hunt) to survive against the horde of jungle animals that threaten to destroy the town until someone finished the game. Lions, elephants, rhinos, monkeys, monsoons, carnivorous plants; all menacing obstacles our characters must overcome as the titular board game send their world in a mysterious jungle-like realm. It is a wild ride brought to life by the a smart execution by director Joe Johnston who knows the magic of Chris Van Allsburg's source material, and translation from book-to-screen by a screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh and Greg Taylor. But the question is \"has it aged well\". In terms of visual effects, the answer is sadly no as the computer generated imagery of the wild animals that release from the board game unfortunately fail to come to life as believable and striking as they did back in 1995. While the film's use of animatronics used on the some of the animals such as the lion have aged well in a way that can send shivers down your in the scene when the hairy creature threatens our young heroes, most of the effects look awfully dated and show evidence of a blockbuster flick released in the mid-1990s. Despite the lack of authenticity perpetrated by these subpar effects, the film luckily manages to stay fun and charming, especially by the comedic charm of Robin Williams who swarms in the movie with livelihood and humility as well as the rest of the cast including Bradley Pierce, Kirsten Dunst, and Bonnie Hunt. As the story progresses, viewers are in for a fair amount of dark, eerie elements including the death of the children's parents, Alan's broken relationship with his father, and the overall chaos that erupts from the game; all of which are enough to leave young children shivering. But with the fun-filled action uprooted in the adventure of the characters, there is still plenty for the family to enjoy. Jumanji may show its age in terms of the effects department, but is still a fun-filled adventure full of laughs, heart, and suspense to keep both kids and adults alike captivated from start to finish. Yes, it is disappointing that it fails to reach the roots of Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park; but that doesn't stop this fantasy adventure of being a friendly, fantasy spectacle. not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late 1960s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. Jumanji! From Book to Film; As a child in 1995, this was one of the greatest adventure films for a kid in my generation. The book from where it came, was good, but the filmmakers made the adaptation pretty darn amazing. The fact that Robin Williams starred made the film better, as Robin was a huge draw to family films of that era. Who ever knew that Jumanji would have a cult following or that it would spawn an actual board game (nothing comes to life), and eventually a sequel in 2017. Too bad Robin isn't here to enjoy or be a part of the sequel. Bonnie Hunt also starred alongside Robin in this film as Sarah, but she's not quite as memorable. Sorry! David Alan Grier also co-starred as Carl the police officer, his acting was somewhat more memorable. One of the most memorable acting performances of the film was Jonathan Hyde as Sam Parrish (Alan's dad) and his dual role as Van Pelt (the hunter from Jumanji). In the end, it was a great film, probably felt more now by some since the passing of Robin Williams. But those of us who've loved the film since the beginning know he made the film what it was. Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Pretty cute, zany adventure.; Let me start this by saying that Robin Was the main draw to this work, although the story is pretty innovative, only having been done a time or two previously. Zany. That's the principal description of this work, between Williams's near-manic performance and the fast-paced action, the busy screenplay, and the frantic sound effects. It was fun and entertaining, if nothing else. Features some monsters and over-sized creatures, so may not be suitable for all ages. It rates a 5.4/10 from... the Fiend :. Wish they had more Jumanji history; My only real complaint with Jumanji is where did this game come from? Who created it? I really wish they could have discovered more about the game's past, it's history. Then it would have made a little more sense. But I'm not saying I didn't like it. On the contrary, I do enjoy it very much, I think it's a cool buried treasure. The characters, the story, the effects all perfect. The cast does a great job in this movie and the concept of a strange magical board game works. I wish there was more monster animals. But the man eating plant and the giant spiders is enough to put it on my page. Robin Williams does great in this first monster movie, wish he do more. But that's just me. Anyway, in conclusion ladies and jelly spoons. This is an assume movie and you can do much worse then Jumanji. 8 STARS. Imaginative (spoiler); This is probably one of the most imaginative movies I have seen in a while. I mean, it has an entire back story, as we can see in the beginning, when those two kids are trying to get rid of the game. Then it goes to 1969, when Alan finds the game, he and Sarah start playing, and he gets sucked into Jumanji. Then, throughout the rest of the movie, Alan comes out of the jungle and he, Sarah, Judy, and Peter continue playing the game and unleashing all these dangerous animals (and Van Pelt) and the monsoon and killer plants into the city. And at the end, those kids in Japan find the game. Very well thought out. Certainly worth a look. An excellent family entertainment achievement, with the keyword family, not just kids.; The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children's book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die! Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter  I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families. Outrageous fun; When young Alan Parish and his childhood friend, Sarah play a board game that Alan found buried near his fathers business, Alan is sucked into the game and left to grow up alone in the jungle. That is until two young children, Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) join the game and release him 26 years later. Every turn in the game becomes a living nightmare that endangers the lives of everyone involved, and the only way to stop it is finish the game. Alan (Robin Williams) and Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) will have to play some more if there lives are return to normality. The concept of the movie is truly original and it successfully delivers on its potential, with an excellent cast and funny script, this adventure is both hilarious and action packed, with some cool special effects thrown in. Great family entertainment 8/10 Very enjoyable fantasy adventure.; Jumanji starts in 1969 in New Hampshire in New England where a young boy named Alan Parish (Adam Hann-Byrdd) &amp; his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) starts playing a strange board game called Jumaji that Alan found buried in the ground earlier, Jumanji turns out to be magical &amp; Alan is sucked into the board game while Sarah runs off. Twenty six years later &amp; it's 1995 &amp; Alan's old house has been empty for years until now, until young brother &amp; sister Judy (Kirsten Dunst) &amp; Peter (Bradley Pierce) move in with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), the two youngsters find the Jumanji game &amp; start playing it themselves as all manner of creatures &amp; climate events begin to appear as does Alan (Robin Williams) who has spent the last twenty six years trapped inside Jumanji &amp; is now an adult. The only way to reverse the effects of Jumanji is to finish the game so with a now adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) the four players must battle whatever Jumanji throw's at them including Lions, Monsoon's, giant Spider's &amp; a stampede... Girected by former special effects man Joe Johnston this oddball fantasy adventure is actually pretty good but there are one or two things that ultimately drag it down to merely a very good film rather than a great film in my opinion. Based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsberg the film is apparently quite different &amp; the two main character's here Alan &amp; Sarah don't even appear in the book, Jumanji is a hard film to categorise as it mixes various ideas &amp; themes like a bad childhood, finding redemption, standing up to your fears, fantasy, sci-fi, horror &amp; comedy. At 100 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace, once it gets going the situation just keeps getting worse &amp; worse as all the chaos &amp; mayhem escalates beyond anyone's control with all sorts of animals running around &amp; the theme of facing your fears is an ever present one. I am not sure there is another film quite like Jumanji &amp; to find something so original &amp; different in a mainstream film is unusual but the CGI effects scenes, the lack of character depth, the refusal to do anything with the plot other than destroy a house &amp; an ultra happy ending which goes on forever that gives every character in the film the best most happy ending is pure Hollywood that was not needed &amp; a slightly darker ending in keeping with the slightly darker tone of the film overall would have been much better. To be honest apart from great set-pieces &amp; the basic concept there's really not that much to Jumanji at all, it's rather shallow &amp; it's attempts at depth are pure heavy handed Hollywood cliché but it's fun &amp; very entertaining while it lasts, just a shame about the last ten minutes really. Jumanji was made just as the CGI computer graphic revolution was taking off back in the mid 90's but the effects do hold up rather well actually, from huge plants to an impressive stampede of Rhino's &amp; Elephant's through a house to a huge Lion with the mischievous Monkey's probably the only real weak effect. As a fairly light hearted fantasy adventure with some darker overtones there's a few amusing moments including a bemused policeman who's car is slowly &amp; systematically trashed &amp; as a whole the film delights in needless destruction &amp; mayhem which is no bad thing. There are some laughs &amp; a few scares as well &amp; I could definitely see Jumanji appealing to both older &amp; younger audiences. With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 this had a very healthy amount spent on it with most going towards the effects I would have thought. Filmed in New Hampshire &amp; British Columbia in Canada. Despite being known as a manic performer Robin Williams is pretty restrained here &amp; his brand of psychical comedy isn't used much, Kirsten Dunst is one of the few child stars to go on &amp; have a successful adult career while the acting generally is pretty good. Jumanji is a unique fantasy adventure that I think would appeal to both children &amp; adults, my only real problem is the sweeter than sweet happier than happy ending which is pure sentimental Hollywood at it's worst. With an ending more in keeping with the rest of the film Jumanji might have got a seven from but as it is it gets a six, good but not great. Followed by Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005) which was shot under the title Jumanji 2. An original plot poorly executed; I was really disappointed with Jumanji. I had heard about the concept and was looking forward to it. It is mean a mean spirited slap stick comedy with no redeeming social value. First of all, you have Robin Williams....I love Williams, when he is kept on a short leash by the director. Left to his own devices he tends to go off the deep end a bit. Then you add the lame script and an over-done score, you get a movie that misses. I gave this movie a 4 because it was an original concept, it had some great cinematography and it had a few really cool special effects. I would love to see this movie remade by a different director a better script writer. Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Unique; I am trying to find my words in order to perfectly describe Robin, but i just realized that it's impossible to do it. Words are not enough to describe such a man... I've seen a lot of people in my life, all kind of people, but i never saw someone having so much warmth and kindness in just a small smile like Robin. That's something which makes you to love him unconditionally. The way he acted in the movies was so original that it can not be compared with anyone else in the history of cinema. He's smile made us all better people a little bit, which means he changed the world in he's own way. He will be always with us, and within us. Let's make him immortal !!! The best of Allsburgh's film adaptations.; Author Chris Van Allburgh has had three film adaptations. His most recent was Zathura, which I didn't like. Before that, The Polar Express was released and re-released. I don't know why because I did't like it that much either. But ten years before Zathura was his first film adaptation, Jumanji. The only one I liked. The only one that critics disliked. Jumanji, for some reason, was a film that I really liked. I'll admit some of it was a bit weird, but I really liked it. I liked it because of Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, two great actors. People don't give Williams enough credit and the same with Hunt. But I love both of them. I also think the film has great visuals and it's a triumph with entertainment. I can understand why critics would call it weird, but I really liked it. You may disagree with me. But there's something about Jumanji that I really liked but I can't think of what exactly it is. Though some parts are kind of odd, Jumanji grabs my attention and I'm recommending it. The Plot: When two kids find a magical board game, they release tons of animals and a person who once played the game when he was younger. This game is like no other.; Roll doubles and look out.  Elaborate special effects highlight this tale about two kids who release an imprisoned player trapped for decades in a supernatural board game. Story line is quite stupid, but this is so much fun to watch. Robin Williams does his thing. A young Kirsten Dunst is charming in this preview of her future talents. Rounding out this mish-mash of a cast are: Bebe Neuwirth, David Alan Grier, Bradley Pierce, Bonnie Hunt and Jonathan Hyde in a dual role. Special effects and sight gags are redeeming. A dark, mysterious, and entertaining childhood favorite of mine; Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good. The end is near!; 'The end is near' was my best thought after an hour of Jumanji. The end of the movie that is. Despite a lot of good reviews of people I hardly know, this film is a first-class let-down. It is the somanieth movie in which Robin Williams comic qualities are abused. The story is about a game, Jumanji, that has come to life. After every move something terrible happens; a stampede or a giant spider attack. The game has to be finished to stop all terrible things happening. Of course Williams' comic talent and the special effects try to safe the movie but everything is overdone. By memory, I recall that the makers promised great special effects; they had used the same effects as Jurassic Park! Yes, they did, but they obviously only got the demo version of the package. Also, poor Kirsten Dunst, having the role of a nice young girl, is transformed is such a prig that all her good intentions fall into nothing. All in all, if you have to choose between watching this movie and cleaning up the house, please clean up your house starting with trashing the video of this movie. This is family entertainment; When two children play a board game a man trapped inside appears and tries to help them finish the game as jungle elements from the game trouble the environment. Shown every Christmas, re-released countless times and still Jumanji never loses its touch with its viewers. This breathtaking imagination of a board game coming to life is as wonderfully exuberant as toys coming to life in Pixar's first film. The concept of a game coming to life is made even more exciting by encoding prospects of deadly animals such as lions, mysterious mosquitoes and violent talented monkeys. Everything is thought of and what a treat we have in our hands. There is now a new definition of family entertainment, known as Pixar. Since releasing Toy Story after this was released they have been dominating the box office with wonderful family tales about sentimental robots, cooking rats and racing cars. And to rewind the clock back 14 years this picture is to be hailed as the beginning of the end. A truly new concept with very little explanation required and a marvellous array of hormonal characters with breathtaking action and enough humour to make you smile, this was and still is marvellous. Family entertainment now either involves a boy with a wand, Harry something, or sitting in your living room watching Simon Cowell make fun of ordinary folk. The reprisal if you want to call it that of non-animated picture was in 2005 where Jon Favreau attempted a step up from this picture, by using the same concept of a board game coming to life and applied it with a sci-fi edge, set in space. Whilst there were moments of good action it boiled down to being a repetitive ideology of this 1995 classic with not enough quick wit and mistimed action sequences with an egregious sentimental intention of brotherly love. This has none of that. There are no overly soppy sentimental parts as the required drama is justified early on. The action continues consistently with first initial deadly elements before the stakes are raised. Van Pelt adds a sharp intake of breath threw his evidently evil hunter, which actually is never properly explained, but that is the point. Nothing is explained, events just happen and we can sit back and enjoy the fun spilling out from every angle. Johnston is the man in the know as the adventure flows with exquisite timing. The scene with the house flood is a perfect example whilst the monkey motorbike stage shows his ability to do comedy. This truly is a remarkable film and is worth watching again and again for its wondrous story, its lovable collection of characters and easy sharp mind. This is family entertainment! good original family movie; Joe Johnston's Jumanji is very good family movie that is well paced. The movie is the story of a mysterious game that involves it's players more than the normal board game. The movie begins with a young boy, Alan Parrish, finding the abandoned game. He talks the girl he has a crush on, Sarah Whittle, into playing with him. Once the game starts, chaos ensues. Robin Williams carries this movie, giving it life. The other actors do okay with the bare dialogue. Joe Johnston uses the experiences on the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies to craft a fantasy world that is believable. Though not outstanding in any way, Jumanji is a fun movie that should delight children with its action and fantasy. 6 out of 10 stars. Very cute, feel good movie; I gave Jumanji 7 out 10, which is a pretty good rating from me. 10 are epics like Gone With The Wind &amp; Lawrence of Arabia, 9 are classics and 8 the near great. 7, like Jumanji, are just good, clean fun; not Oscar worthy movies, but movies worth watching. Robin Williams delivers a fairly straight performance for him, but it works, it is good acting. Kirsten Dunst, does a great job as his love interest and former playmate. Other roles by David Alan Grier, Bonnie Hunt, Jonathan Hyde and Bebe Neuwirth fill out the cast nicely along with the child actors who play Peter &amp; Judy and the young Alan &amp; Sarah. Jumangi was one of the better, more successful films to come out of TriStar. One of my favourite films ever; This film is great, it is definitely a family film (little kids might get scared when there are *SPOILER* guns shooting or when the giant spiders have surrounded the actors,or when a crocodile attacks the man but apart from that it isn't too scary), but it is one of those films everyone has got to see. I first watched this film when it first came onto TV (they now repeat it every year), and I have been captivated by the imaginative story every single time I've seen it. The basic storyline is that two kids find an old board game, but when they start playing, the madness begins- stampeding animals and more! This is a story about friendship, love, sticking together and much, much more. If you haven't seen this film already WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!! Below average action adventure; I knew Jumanji was never going to burst with intelligence or be driven by great performances, and yet despite this I was quite looking forward to it as a holiday blockbuster. Well to put it in simple terms that was a mistake. The films plot stands a chance of being the most convoluted of the year with so many back stories it only ever annoys. It starts of with a young boy called Alan Parish who gets sucked into a board game, at this point I should have left as it only gets more idiotic. After this incident we flash forward twenty years to find two new children have found the game. They unleash Alan who is now grown up and played by an irritating Robin Williams. Along with him an assortment of Jungle beasties are unleashed into their quiet neighbourhood. The kids and Alan must complete the game to restore everything but with every throw of the dice more horrors await. The film resembles an ameturish pantomine in every respect a part from the visual effects. Director Joe Johnston also responsible for the mediocre Honey I shrunk the Kids should have treated the audience like adults, then the film might have gone somewere. However as the movie doesn't treat us like adults and depends totally on its special effects I think its safe to say its a failure. The performances particularly from the children and Robin Williams are predictable and annoying. Jumanji might entertain under 7's or those with IQ's under 50 but for the rest of us it simply is a heavily flawed and rather rubbish piece of cinema Early CGI Makes the Monkeys Look Fake! Otherwise It's Amazing!; An enchanted board game breaks into the real world and the only way out of it is to finish the game! The monkeys look \"washed-out\" and so do some of the wild zoo animals; which is why most of the rest of the EFX are mechanical or use backdrops and mattes. Otherwise a very strong 10 would be my vote, as the casting works and the plot shows lots of imagination and flair. With a \"sly wink\" to \"Peter Pan\", Alan's father plays both his dad and Van Pelt the Hunter. My two favorite scenes are when the house gets folded in half and eaten by the monstrous plant, and when everything swirls backwards into the gameboard. I also love it when the house goes \"wild\" and turns into a swamp complete with nasty alligators. I do not like the scene where the little boy turns into a monkey with a tail. Young children may find it disturbing like the donkey transformation in \"Pinocchio\". \"Jumanji\" is suspenseful and scary but no one actually dies in the film. Therefore, it's much more enjoyable when viewed again. The only one who seemed to hate it was Roger Ebert, but it's only too scary for pre-schoolers. Most \"users\" love it! What \"scares\" me the most in this film: the bats, insects, spiders, alligators, and The Hunter. The sequel will not have the charisma of the late and great Robin Williams. I still miss him. He was a comic genius. If there was a market for it, I would like it to be re-imagined with better graphics like the old \"Star Trek TOS\" reissue.  So you'll help us?; Robin Williams is incredible as Alan in this outstanding adventure movie. The supporting cast is phenomenal. The costumes are conservative. One of the good films in the genre, Jumanji will dare the viewer to play the game. 7 out of 10. 18 years of being a \"favourite\"; I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and \"Jumanji\" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie &amp; it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life. Jumanji; I think that kids would like this movie better then grownups. I loved this movie but my mom thinks the plot is to low. The movie is based on the book Jumanji and is a lot more deeper then the book. My bother thought that the movie was corny and the special effects were so bad they were funny but what does he know? OK maybe the effects were bad but whatever. I mean the movie was made along time ago so give them a break. I thought the movie was really good and the acting was great. Its the kind of movie that if you like it you watch it again and again and again. When I was sick I saw it 4 times and I still thought it was good. All and all I would give this movie a 9. I think that kids would like to see it. The Disney movie that could have been; Hunt and Williams play the parts of shellshocked-delayed stress syndrome surviviors quite well. The story is entertaining and engrossing, with both elements of light and darkness. The effects-well, they DO look a bit unreal-and perhaps that is for the best-it adds a sense of unreality to the story -after all, these things come from a board-game universe! Even Van Pelt looks a bit CGI...and Bebe Nuewerth is a sweetie. Decent family entertainment; On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children. Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it. In the jungle you must wait....; In the jungle you must wait, until the dice reads five or eight. So professes a mysterious board game possessed by dark magic to young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd), a boy with no clue just how far an innocent roll of the dice can take you. From the first ominous drumbeat the game utters, until the last fading tones it plays the film out with, Jumanji is a giddy rush of pure adventure, with a refreshingly dark and primal side to its mayhem. Alan disappears from the 1950's and we fast forward 25 years later. Young orphans Peter and Judy (Kirsten Dunst &amp; Bradley Pierce) are moving into his old family home, so fate (and those damn creepy drums) would have them find the Jumanji in the attic, and continue the game Alan started with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) over a decade ago. Suddenly every jungle creature, meteorological phenomenon and 90's CGI monster erupts from the game into their little town, causing a mess that goes beyond the word havoc. This includes a near feral middle aged Alan, now played by Robin Williams. Together with a most reluctant Sarah, the quartet try to stop the destruction, play the game, but mostly just survive this onslaught. Psychotic monkeys, mutant mosquitoes, an elephant stampede, monsoons, giant spiders (fucking shudder) and crocodiles are but a few of the wonders awaiting them. My favourite has to be murderous Victorian game hunter Van Pelt, played mightily by stage actor Jonathan Hyde, with a pith helmet and an epic mustache that would make Kurt Russell chortle. Hyde does excellent double duty as both the deranged hunter and Alan's stern but loving father, a tough contrast he handles like a champ. I admire the film's willingness to go creepy and dark, despite being geared towards kids. The danger feels real, the game has an eerie mysticism to it, a life of it's own that gives you goosebumps. Not often do family orientated films have a shred of real fear in them anymore, so let's count our blessings with this one, still holding strong today. The special effects are dated in places (those monkeys, man) and wonderful in others (that hardwood floor quicksand tho), but you have to cut them some slack, it being 1996 after all. Williams and Hunt have snarky banter that barely hides their love for each other, and it's one of my favourite on screen pairings he ever had with a gal. He makes Alan resourceful, kind and just a little bit crazy, but the guy did spend years alone in a treacherous jungle straight out of your nightmares, so that can be expected. Amidst the chaos you can look out for Patricia Clarkson, a deadpan Bebe Neurith and David Alan Grier as well. There's a lot of stuff crammed into the film, but never does it feel bloated or crippled by it's own weight, flowing nicely and taking time where it can to develop character and give it's human cast just as much to do as all the crazy jungle stuff. I'm surprised I never saw any of this go down as a kid, because parts of it were filmed blocks from my neighborhood, and CGI was scant back then, so much of it would have physically been there, large and loud. Maybe I did, and have since forgotten. I definitely haven't forgotten any of the film, though, and allow for repeated viewings whenever I have the time. It's one of the best, most thrilling adventure stories of its time and ages well as each year passes. Cue the drums. An enjoyable board game, so an enjoyable movie!; This is one of the movies that I really enjoy, even if I do not like comedy and fantasy that much, by the way I don't like Robin Williams either, he thinks he's a funny person, but he isn't, some of his movies like `Jack', `Good Will Hunting', and some others are quite bad. Most of his movies leave too much to be desired. He's just annoying, because it seems to me that he thinks that everybody who sees him will laugh at the ridiculous things he does, he enjoys making fun of the human body, women, men, etc. I dislike it enormously; however I must say that I really enjoyed this movie even though he was starring and the visual effects were obviously computerized. I was impressed by the originality of Jumanji. It's such an innovative, interesting and enjoyable movie. I liked it because the plot is extremely original, creative and gripping. Who on earth would be able to think of a game like Jumanji? An imaginative game in which journeys, action, fantasy, and perhaps a little bit of terror surpass all things. I like this movie because it teaches us to enjoy everyday to its fullest, we see that Alan Parker was a frustrated kid at the beginning of the movie, but after staying in the jungle until the dice read 5 or 8, he realized how worthy his life was. Also it teaches us to respect others, for instance we see the little boy who began to turn into a wolf after cheating on the game was crying and Alan who was a grown-up person then yelled at him, and made him feel bad, but after that he was sorry since he remembered the way his father yelled at him, so this is a valuable lesson, since it shows that parents must be patient and loving to their family, but sometimes love can be hazardous to them. `Jumanji' is a nice movie for all ages; it's a very risky, but enjoyable game, in which your life is at stake. The board game (Jumanji) was good looking, it was really mysterious and interesting, whoever saw it would love to play it. Overall the movie was a very good one, I enjoyed every minute and especially Kristin Dunst's performance who also played in \"Spiderman\", I also enjoyed Mr. Williams's performance, I'm glad he at last did something worth it. Anyway it was an enjoyable movie, but I'd have loved this if it had been more dramatic, terrifying, sad, etc. 8/10 Not board; Watched this on TV where it was aired as a tribute to the late Robin Williams. It's an enjoyable family-entertainment fantasy adventure with Williams playing a grown man who as a boy was sucked into a mysterious, dark board game called Jumanji, freed years later by a couple of young children who happen upon the game when they move into Williams's character by this time run-down house. Along with Williams also fully-grown girl friend of the time Kirsten Dunst, the four of them brave everything the game throws at them to finish it and free Williams to return to his old life. And does the game throw everything at them! Crazy monkeys, a roaring lion, a jungle which comes to life, hordes of stampeding elephants zebras and rhinos and one very persistent big game hunter. A veritable special effects fest, while the plot amounts to no more than awaiting the outcome of the next roll of the dice on the board, it all makes for good clean exciting fun and who amongst us as never enjoyed playing a board game as a child. The back stories about Williams being bullied as a child, having a fractious relationship with his dad and his adult wooing of Dunst are lightly drawn but all of course resolved happily ever after by the end. Williams is fine after he makes his delayed first appearance, portraying yet again a child trapped in a man's body just as he did in a line going back through Peter Pan in \"Hook\", \"Popeye\" all the way to his breakout part in \"Mork and Mindy\". Dunst offers good support and the kids aren't too gauche and sentimental either. Nice to see \"Cheers\" Bebe Neuwirth get a decent part too. I wouldn't call it Robin Williams defining role but as an update on the old children's matinée features, this was an entertaining feature made the better by Williams engaging performance. R.I.P. to him. Brings back a lot of memories. Still a good ride.; My Take: A terrific special effects-laden adventure. JUMANJI is among those films I strongly remember from my childhood. Along with JURASSIC PARK and its sequel, JUMANJI is among those films I enjoy watching multiple times just to see creatures wreck havoc on a crowded street, monsters crawl in from the dark and other bits of special effects extravaganza. I strongly remember the elephants and rhinos stampeding around the crowded streets, a giant man-eating flower with vine-like tentacles, those messy (and weakly done CGI) monkeys with antics borrowed from GREMLINS, the crocodile and the shot of the house breaking apart. What I didn't remember was how faulty the dramatic interludes were. Which is exactly the point. JUMANJI is a wildly entertaining special effects extravaganza that works much better that way. Director Joe Johnston, who revived old-fashioned pulp adventures with THE ROCKETEER and later made JURASSIC PARK III so much better than it might have been, is such an accomplished action director. JUMANJI is a terrific and highly entertaining, if sometimes perilous, family adventure, though it does make several rest stops for back-stories and a bit of drama which sacrifices the pacing. The movie opens with two kids in 1969 with two kids curiously playing the titular game board which eventually unleashes African bats in the fireplace and sucking in little Alan Parrish (then played by Adam Hann-Byrd) inside the game. Forward 26 years later, someone else has bought the old Parrish mansion and the two new kids (Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce) dig up the old board game in the dusty old attic and give the dice a little role, and all hell breaks loose in town. With a little help from an older Alan Parrish (now played by Robin Williams) and his now older best friend Sarah (delightfully played by Bonnie Hunt), they try to finish what they started, unleashing more special effects behemoth after another. That's just about the \"plot\" of JUMANJI, yet I can go on forever with its visual treats. While the CGI doesn't live up to today standards (not to mention the totally unconvincing CGI monkeys!), but some of them in particular (including the terrific sequences where elephants and rhinos rampage around town and inside the mansion living room) still are eye candy. And, courtesy of director Johnston, there are still well-orchestrated moments of excitement. Stars Hunt and co-star David Alan Grier as a cop having a bad day provide the laughs. Despite some dull moments, which have a very major thing to do with its weak writing department, JUMANJI is still an amiable piece of entertainment. Still worth a look, but you might have the options of fast-forwarding to the really good parts. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5. Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... All sorts of things; As a child Williams is \"captured\" by bizarre jungle survival board game.  He emerges 26 years later when the game is next played by two orphans.  Williams and Hunt give it their best and a young Dunst is effective, while the movie itself is alternately poignant, absurd, mildly if broadly humorous, and very uncomfortable.  If you've bought into the premise and can follow it through the finale is very satisfying. The graphics were superb; This movie was a real hit in our family. The action was intense all the way through. You didn't know what to expect. It was so good I ended up buying it on tape. I recommend anyone reading this should do the same. Think of it as Night At The Museum meets a board game; Jumanji is based off a cartoon TV series that was made into a film in 1995 and stars funnyman Robin Williams who plays a man called Alan Parrish who as a kid played a board game called Jumanji which was been buried since 1869 with his friend Sarah(Bonnie Hunt)in the year 1969.But when Alan plays the game he gets sucked into it as his friend Sarah watched in horror as each time the player plays the game consequences occur and the only way to finish the game is to play the whole thing. Fast forward 26 years later in 1995 and two young children played by Kirsten Dunst (from the Spider-Man franchise)and Bradley Pierce who's parents died along time ago are now living with their aunt as their aunt bought Alan's old house.But when the two kids stumble across the board game as they hear the drums playing in the background in the attic,its up to them to try and finish off where the player left off and free Alan who helps them finish the game with his friend Sarah. But will they finish the game. Overall this film is really good until the very end which was sorta confusing for me. If you seen it you know what it is but it involves time travelling back to 1969 and then back to 1995 again. But still if you are a fan of Fantasy movies,Robin Williams and if you love something to keep you entertained on a lazy Sunday afternoon Jumanji is worth checking out. A lovely little film; This four year-old film, I would highly recommend for anyone out there in fantasy-land. Nice special effects, a very good idea behind the plot and Robin Williams all ensure a thoroughly enjoyable experience if you like action-comedies without the ubiquitous \"Good vs. Bad\" show-down. Jumanji is very different and well worth seeing. I look forward to the upcoming Jumanji 2 next year;  the cast for Jumanji 2 probably needs to include Gerard Depardieu instead of Robin Williams!!!! :-) A little adventurous... and childish.; Jumanji is a great idea.  The movie has great potential and could have turned out excellent and a true action classic. However, some aspects of the movie prevent that.  For example, the monkeys in the kitchen and abroad hardly look like monkeys.  They look like warped, evil, demonic beings with fur and tails that were only made to cause mischief.  Well, sure, you might say that's what the game meant to do, but come on... I think they should have used real monkeys here. Certain parts of the dialogue are a little corny and make one feel as though we're watching \"Spy Kids\", which can sometimes really ruin the feel that they're in a life-or-death situation. The acting was great (some parts it was not), and as usual, Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst put on an above-average performance. The action and crashes and other sequences are a contradiction, in a way.  Here we have fake-looking monkeys, but superbly crafted action. The music, composed by James Horner, is quite dull and does not help get you into the spirit of the movie.  A lower-than-average job on his part. Overall, this movie is really good.  I would suggest watching it if you can get past some annoying areas of the movie. My Childhood; This movie made my childhood. I love Robin Williams movies, Jumanji introduced him to me. Jumanji is a movie that everyone should watch. Robin Williams will again make you appreciate living as he always does in his movies. The movie contains full of fantasy objects. The writer has a really great imagination. I will make my children to watch this movie after all years that pass. While watching this movie as a kid, I was scared, excited and happy. It makes you to feel every kind of feeling. This indicates that the movie has done a good job. I again recommend to everyone. Jumanji appeals for all ages. I am pretty sure I will watch the movie again when I get old with the same emotions when I watched it in the first time. Action and adventure for the kids, and Robin Williams for the adults; Find a comfortable chair, lay out the board, grab the dice, and get ready to play.  But remember:  once you start this game, you can't stop.  If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must. \"Jumanji\" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  The basic premise stays the same:  a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure.  When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things.  Only finishing the game will make it all go away. In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added.  Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself.  He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing.  The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams!  Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter. Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles.  He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt.  The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the \"This is MY baby\" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike. Parrish House's Plans; Hi there! I would really appreciate if you can help me with this. I really love that movie, cause of the old Parrish House. I am planning to build my own house by the end of this year and the model that I have in mind is Jumanji's Parrish House. Of course, watching the movie any architect could design the exterior facade, but it has been really hard to find the floor pans. Does anyone have idea of a web page or any source where I could find the floor plans? In advance I thank you for your help. Kind regards, Ralph A great movie; JUMANJI I loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today! The movie is about a boy who finds a board game called Jumanji. When he takes it home and starts to play it with a friend, he soon realises that this is no ordinary game. He gets sucked into the game and is not released again until 26 years later 2 more kids find the game and release him. Now he is grown up and has to find a way to end this game before everything it releases destroys the town. Due to the sad passing of the genius that was Robin Williams, the TV channels have decided to show all of his movies. Jumanji was the first one I saw. The story to this film is like not her that I had seen before. It was an original idea (unless there is another film I don't know about) that was just so imaginative. It works really well and has a great adventure element about it. The effects are average. This was made in the mid 90s so that probably has something to do with it. The animals were obviously not real. You could see the lion was so mechanical it made me laugh. And the other animals were so obviously computer generated. But it was comical and that just added to the fun of the film. The acting was great. The main character was played by Robin Williams. He was as energetic and full of character in this role, just like he brought to every role he took. Other cast members were Jonathan Hyde, a young Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bonnie Hunt. Bonnie Hunt was brilliant. Her reaction and facial expressions made me laugh a few times in this. Another stand out performance was by David Alan Grier. David was so funny as the cop. His comedy timing was excellent and deserves a mention. This film really does keep you entertained throughout and is just a lot of fun to watch... Even now nearly 20 years later. I will give this 7 out of 10. Normally I end my reviews with a quote from the movie, but this time I just want to say how gutted I am about the news of Robins death. I am a fan of his work. I watched Mork and Mindy when I was a kid and grew up watching Jumanji, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam, Jack etc... There were so many great films that he made. I always saw Robin as so full of energy and full of life. He had one of the greatest smiles in Hollywood and when i saw an interview with him, he seemed so chirpy and happy. It just shows that in front of the camera, you never know what is going on in people's heads. I was sad to hear he had been suffering from depression. Depression is such a deadly illness. I know this sounds stupid, but I am gutted that I was not there to talk to him, help him. I hate to think that he felt so alone, especially as he had millions of fans all over the world that knew him on screen. He made the world laugh out loud so many times. Even through bad times in my life, watching his movies has put a smile on my face. Robin deserved much more happiness than he got. He gave so much to me and the rest of the world and it doesn't seem right that he should end his life this way. I will miss seeing new movies from him, but will always continue to go back to enjoy his old ones. Robin will live on in my house and he will always continue to make me smile. R.I.P. Robin Williams. Built around special effects that haven't aged well; I remember watching this film as a kid and loving it, but revisiting it now is like watching a different film. 'Jumanji' has lost its magic. It came across much better a few years ago, when CGI and special effects weren't as common as they are today. Unfortunately, with the film being so special effect oriented, it hasn't aged well. The effects are dated now and just don't have the same impact as they used to. Having said that, this is still a moderately entertaining film with an interesting and original plot, based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsburg. Robin Williams is excellent as Alan, as you would expect. I enjoyed this film a lot more a few years ago, but it hasn't aged well and has lost its magic. A breathless unforgettable adventure!; I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind... This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure. Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story. Great! 10 out of 10 from me! Excellent!; There is only one way to describe Jumanji: excellent. The plot is very, original, with outstanding concepts packed into each individual scene. After viewing this movie, the wild side of the jungle gets into you, making you want to dare to play the game. Although the computer animation may not look all that real, I still give this movie a 10/10, for an outstanding plot, casting, and spirit, which any great movie has. Entertaining...but one major problem; Jumanji is an entertaining movie. I'm surprised its IMDB \"User Rating\" is only 5.9. I would give it a 7. However, I don't understand why the kids (and Robin Williams) keep playing the game. With every roll of the dice, they put their lives in more jeopardy...along with the lives of everyone in the city. They could have stopped anytime after the bats or the mosquitoes or the monkeys or the lion. But they kept going (under the guise of \"finishing the game is the only way to make everything return to normal\"). I kept yelling at the screen, \"Stop playing Jumanji and you'll be okay.\" Of course, if they had stopped playing the game, then there's no movie. Good fantasy movie...; Well the Jumanji is just a great movie which shows how life is filled with luck and chances... The concept of game of dice is so good and the movie will be a bit of thriller too because we will be curious what may come next when they roll the dice each time.... Williams did his Alan character well, i almost felt like crying when Alan came to know that his family is no more.... The only backdrop of the movie is the monkey. It seems so unusual..... Overall, a good movie everyone could watch....:) Enjoy... :) Game Over, Man; Spoilers herein. The reason this film was made was because they could do the effects. That reason has no power now, and in fact most of them already look a bit cheezy. But there are some interesting elements: --Kirstin Dunst at her peak. --Robin Williams in his best role. Or rather for the role best suited to a manic comic. --A pretty cool house, one of the best in recent memory. --Some clever time folding. --A screenwriter's wet dream: in addition to creating a film world that sucks in viewer into an artificial reality, to have that film world contain another one. That world-within-the world is exactly as far from the normal world of the film as it is from us. Just like the film, it grabs us once we start and won't let go until the end. Clever idea. Not exploited. Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements. I love this movie so much; If you do not love this movie you are crazy. Its filled with action and excitement. I love Sarah Whittle played by the famous Bonnie Hunt. I also like Carl Bentley, a clueless police officer played by the comedian David Alan Grier. This movie is so creative. My sister and I watch the movie every weekend, we do not get tired of it. This movie did not get the awesome rating it deserved. People sometimes do not understand a quality move when they see one. I would strongly, strongly, strongly recommend the movie. Trust me you will love it to death. If you do not... then you are odd. Please watch the movie, try it you'll love it...duh!!! i miss my childhood; 6.6,,,,,,,,,,,,, i don't believe this. 10 people 10,,, anyone who have watched this as a kid will give this a 10... common for heavens sake,,, this is the best fantasy movie that some one could wish for as a kid.......... for heavens sake this movie was not made keeping logic in mind please,, its just fun,,, thats all it is,,,this movie is one of the best memories A KID OF 90S HAVE AS A KID,,,people who hate this movie can go to hell,,,, any parents out there please let your kids watch this,,, they will love you a lot..these are the kind of movies which make me miss my childhood ,,, Throw the dice and take a turn, Jumanji made the critics gurn.; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and based on Chris Van Allsburg's short story of the same name. It stars Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Jonathan Hyde. The story is about a weird board game that when played unleashes hazards from the jungle with every throw of the dice. Once you have started playing you have to finish the game for normality to be resumed. Simple in plot and coming off as an excuse to show off some impressive effects-said the critics- Jumanji defied the critics of the time to become a box office winner and a family favourite. Enough of a favourite to spawn a sequel (Zathura 2005) , an animated TV series and a board game. In truth the film is reliant on its effects to entertain, with the cast (all competent and enjoyable) merely lurching from one perilous throw of the dice to another. But to call the film shallow is wrong and ignorant. There's flecks of bad parenting, peer pressure, grief and bullying, while the impact of a missing child on one town is a noteworthy addition to the story line. You wonder if those critics actually paid attention during their free viewings?. Yes it's berserker family fun, but it's not without worth in the writing too. Besides which, for the action set pieces and the laughs-they alone mean the film has its merits. 7/10 Entertaining family/adventure/fantasy; Released in 1995, \"Jumanji\" is fun movie about a mystical board game from the 1800s, which is found in 1969 leading to the mysterious disappearance of a rich boy. The game is discovered again in 1995 by two orphans (Jonathan Hyde and Kirsten Dunst) who play the game and bring back the lost boy now an adult (Robin Williams). The only way they can stop the havoc the game causes is to finish it. Bonnie Hunt, David Alan Grier and Bebe Neuwirth are also on hand. Patricia Clarkson has a small role. \"Jumanji\" is a great example of the way youth adventures should be done. It's entertaining from beginning to end for children, teens and adults. If you've lost sight of your inner-kid give \"Jumanji\" a try. What makes it worthwhile for adults, besides simply being fun, is that it contains compelling themes and everything ties-up for a moving climax. Plus Bebe Neuwrith looks great (she played Frasier's psychologist babe on Cheers). The movie runs 104 minutes and was shot in Maine, New Hampshire and the Vancouver, British Columbia, area. GRADE: B+ a game not like the other ones; \"Jumanji\" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game \"jumanji\" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy. Epitome of Moronic Hollywood Film-Making; A previous reviewer wrote: \"A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie.\" I agree in part and disagree in part with that comment. The problem is impossible to pinpoint, because there are PLENTY of \"big problems\" with this movie! \"Random hazard generator\" is the PERFECT description of the ancient board game! Random hazard after random hazard until the game ends is what is supposed to pass for \"plot\" in this movie. Did anybody count how many times the game board fell out of and back into the players' hands? That, too is supposed to pass for tension. Ultimately, the film fails because there isn't any development of the back story. What was the origin of the game? Now, that would have been an interesting question to explore! And how does the game work? All we ever see is the game's projection of \"random hazards\" OUTWARD into the reality of the players, but somehow Alan (Robin Williams) apparently was sucked INTO the game. How did that happen, and why doesn't it happen to any of the current players of the game? Actually, the guy in the pith helmet is, more or less, the human villain in this movie, but he is never more than an inexplicable, evil cartoon. Was he, too sucked into the game like Alan, or is he the sole human \"random hazard\" generated by the game? Why is he so determined, not to hunt animals, but to MURDER Alan? The film just glosses over the fact that this sub-plot is actually one of premeditated murder! The hunter guns for Alan simply because the plot demands it. But the movie makes no attempt whatever to explain the character. Never once did I sense any genuine emotional chemistry among the characters. Just a bunch of actors acting - not INTERACTING. The love story sub-plot felt obligatory, never genuine. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt never generated enough chemistry to make me care whether Alan and Sarah got together in the predictable end. All in all, this film has the germ of an interesting idea that is really wasted by focusing on mindless, non-stop \"random hazards,\" poor CGI effects, \"lots of screaming and running around\" and insufficient character development. Except for the precise nature of each \"random hazard,\" the whole film was disappointingly predictable, including the cliché of the almost-kiss in the midst of peril routine. How many zillion times has that been used? The dialog is a similarly endless stream of clichés. The issue was never HOW the game would end - but WHEN. The more interesting issues were never even glanced at. This kind of movie can only appeal to people raised on video games. It was generated by that kind of adventure-for-the-sake-of-adventure mentality, and it has that same kind of feel. This rocks!; Jumanji rocks! The effect of everything is awesome. If Jumanji 2 ever comes out it better be good cause it would be a put down if it was terrible. Robin Williams is a great actor! You could have not picked a better person for the part of Allen. The jungle; This is an excellent movie for all ages. Congratulations to the cast, production, stunts and all the people. And now I want know what's happen in the jungle when Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) was there for 26 years. This should be a good adventure. pretty good, except...; Jumanji is an enjoyable, and at times exciting family adventure. Only one major flaw: the special effects. Jumanji relies on special effects for impact. Nothing wrong with that, only its so easy to tell that they are special effects. Enough fun to get you to sit through it, but they should really find another effects crew next time. 2/4 Exciting Family Adventure; In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called \"Jumanji\", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished. Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human. The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like \"Dead Poet's Society\" or \"Good Morning, Vietnam\"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality. This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor. Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the \"Narnia\" stories). Fortunately, any moralising in \"Jumanji\" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of \"alternative timelines\". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10 Probably not perfect, but very fun; Jumanji is a highly imaginative and very fun movie. The visuals are good, and the story is creative and exciting. The storyline consists of a man being sucked into a board game. 26 years later, two kids find the board game and set him free. However, the game board has already released a few dangers, and those dangers must be stopped. The only way to do that is to finish the board game, and the animals (or whatever else was released from the game) will be put back into the game. There is action and minor thrills, and the movie emerges as being a fun experience. It's kind of creative, and it's an excellent adventure film. Sure, it is a bit cliché'd and the monkeys look pretty corny, but don't let them distract you from the overall enjoyment of the movie. 6.5/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment. An entertaining, chaotic adventure, one which impressed me as a kid and still does now; I first heard of this successful family adventure movie at school in the late primary grades. It must have been new to the VHS format at the time (meaning I missed its successful theatrical run), and a student in my class brought a copy in for show and tell. I think I was interested in seeing it for months before I finally did. I remember watching it more than once on video in the summer of 1996. After those months of anticipation, I don't think I was let down, even if it did seem weird and scary the first time, with all the chaos. I guess I wasn't used to seeing that in films at the time. I've watched it again twice in recent years, after growing up, and both times, I found that it was still entertaining, unlike some movies I enjoyed in my childhood. In 1969, Alan Parrish is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Brantford, New Hampshire, with an upper class family. One day, after being ambushed by a group of bullies, he hears a mysterious sound of drums coming from a construction site! At the site, he digs up a box, where the sound is coming from, a box which was buried there 100 years earlier! Inside, he finds a board game called Jumanji, and takes it home. When Alan is at home by himself after a falling out with his father, his friend, Sarah Whittle, comes over, and he shows her the game. They begin to play it, not realizing how powerful and dangerous it is! Alan is sucked inside, and Sarah is chased off by bats that come out of the game! 26 years later, two kids, Judy and Peter Shepherd, whose parents have died, move into the old Parrish house with their aunt Nora. The siblings hear the drumming of Jumanji from up in the attic, and find the game. They start playing the game without a clue, just like Alan and Sarah did, and dangerous animals begin to come out of it! Also, Alan is finally released after being trapped in the jungle for 26 years! He learns that the year is 1995, and sadly, his parents have passed away. He must now continue the game with Judy and Peter, and reunite with Sarah. The four of them are all players now, and they must finish the game if things are ever going to go back to normal, which will obviously be very risky! The film starts well with the spooky 1869 sequence, when the box is buried out in the dark. After that, it's usually pretty good around the beginning. During the first of my two latest viewings, I remember finding most of the movie dull before Robin Williams comes in, but with my last viewing, I didn't find that to be the case. There isn't much humour during this part of this film, but there is some suspense. When Williams does make his boisterous entry, that's when the humour starts. After that, there's both excitement, with all the action and chaos, and humour. Williams provides laughs with his antics, but the film doesn't rely entirely on him for the humour. Sarah's reluctance to continue the game in 1995, the scene with Van Pelt, the trigger happy hunter from the game in a gun shop, and Aunt Nora and Officer Carl Bentley witnessing some of the Jumanji animals are also funny. Other merits of \"Jumanji\" include some poignant moments, good CGI effects (even if they're not the best, and have been topped since then), and decent acting, which includes decent child actors, unlike some films. All these things are what I think makes this film good family entertainment. really fun movie , Robin Williams excellent as always; Jumanji like Ghost , I surprised myself with the note in Metascore , very low, only 39 ?, the film is very fun , obviously in terms of the film script is weak , plus the cast is good, great Robin Williams as always Kristen Dunst young , and also participation as a police officer David Alan Grier , and his scenes are funny, the special effects at the time are acceptable , plus some people may not like , since the film is not as present (one of the big reasons because I support the remake will have Dwayne Johnson , Kevin Hart and Jack Black) , has good fun characters , some are boring , have really nice moments , and the end of the film hinted that would have a continuation , Jumanji is a good movie , is an excellent pass time , where we see Robin Williams do what do best , take the viewer smiles . Note 7.5 A walk in the memory lane; We (me and my brother) used to watch a cartoon named \"Jumanzi\" every Wednesday, back in 2000. Watching this movie talk me through a walk in my memory lane. The great Robin Williams also makes me nostalgic. 26 years, struggling and surviving, and than fighting back to get their life back. It is called human spirit. Though, every bit of it is fantasy, the plot become more human, when Robin remembered his saviors, who give him another chance in the game. A fairly lively jungle jaunt.; I think when Jumanji was released ten years ago, it was probably an attempt to cash in on the recent success of Jurassic Park. Both films have similar ideas. Using CGI effects to bring all manner of creatures to life. Although not quite as successful as JP, I still found Jumanji an exciting film. Beginning in 1869, in the town of Brantford, New Hampshire, two boys are hurriedly trying to bury something in the woods. This certain something doesn't take kindly to it, and protests in the form of jungle drums. Just before they leave, they pray for the poor soul who should ever find it. We cut to 1969, when young boy Alan Parrish is drawn to a construction site by the mysterious sound of jungle drums. It leads him to a chest. When he opens it, he finds a board game, JUMANJI. Alan has no way to know he is about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime! Showing the game to his best friend Sarah, they become enthralled in the game's seemingly magical powers. It's pieces move by themselves. Words appear in a crystal at the centre. And things have a tendency to come out of it when they roll the dice. Things take a nasty turn when after Alan rolls a 5, the game pulls him into it, where he remains trapped for 26 years. A new family move into Alan's home, Judy (Kirsten Dunst), Peter, and their aunt Nora (a woefully underused Bebe Neuwirth). The game calls to them as it did Alan and Sarah, and they end up releasing giant mosquitoes, a group of mischievous monkeys, a ferocious lion, and a fully grown Alan Parrish (Robin Williams). Alan barely has time to register how much time has passed when he realises there are more rules to JUMANJI then he thought. Everything that has come out of the game so far will stay in our world until a player reaches the end. But getting to the end is easier said than done. The more moves they make, the more dangerous things come out of the game. Reuniting with an adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), our foursome must tackle JUMANJI'S dangers and finish the game once and for all. Although there's not much to Jumanji plot-wise (a trait it shares with Jurassic Park), there are enough thrills and spills going on you'll barely have time to notice. No sooner have our heroes survived one deadly encounter, the film throws in another. That type of dynamic is really what drives the film, and there are times where Jumanji feels repetitive. But it has a decent cast to carry things along nicely. Robin Williams plays it relatively straight, but then I usually prefer his more dramatic roles to his larger than life ones, so it didn't bother me. And compared to most of the sugary shite he was churning out during this period, Jumanji was a nice change of pace. Bonnie Hunt adds some of her own comic touch, who's been left a nervous wreck after witnessing what happened to Alan as a child. The children are not that bad either. That's one thing I like about Joe Johnston's films. The children in his films actually have a shred of dignity to their characters, and are not nearly as precocious as they might have been in the hands of a less able director. Jumanji is certainly imaginative. We get quite a menagerie of creatures on display. Stampeding elephants and rhinos. Giant spiders. Man-eating plants and vines. This could all be a mite too scary for younger kids. But I first saw Jumanji at the age of 12, and I loved it. There are nice touches of humour throughout that help offset the scarier scenes. And there's a funny running gag about a policeman's car that gets slowly wrecked by the different things coming out of the game. Unfortunately, when it comes to the CGI, the effects are nowhere near as dazzling as Jurassic Park's dinosaurs. The filmmakers just haven't got the hang of using CGI. The monkeys especially look fake. And some of the animatronics could have been handled better. Those spiders are very jerky when they move. But the film more than makes up for its shortcomings in the action scenes. Joe Johnston seems to get a certain glee watching his CGI creations running rampant destroying everything, in much the same way Joe Dante did in Gremlins. It's certainly not a boring film. The indoor monsoon is my favourite part, where Alan has to wrestle a crocodile! It's fairly inventive too, when Alan nearly gets swallowed up after the floor turns to quicksand. And the earthquake. Brilliant! If you can simply switch your brain to autopilot and try not to think too much, you'll be in for a fun ride. Overall, Jumanji may be a bit shallow, but you'll find it difficult not to get sucked in.</td>\n",

       "      <td>very funny.; This film has some of the funniest lines and it's a great comedy. One would probably think, even I, thought that this would probably happen between two older men who fight about the obvious: women, fish and each other. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are a perfect pair. Even though it's a comedy, the romance in it is on the clean side. Nothing too distasteful and the comic relief is still included into the romance, which gives it a continuous comic flow. Even though there is a serious part of the film where John's father passes away, after that scene the film is back to the comic feel, which is nice because there's no dwelling on the sad/serious scene. Nonetheless, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh hard. Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. Is it better than original?; Is this movie better than the original? Perhaps. It's probably funnier than the original. Walter Matthau's pick-up line is one of the funniest things of the movie. But is it better than the original? The original had more of the emotions of Lemmon and Matthau as they fought. This one has less feuding (but still has some of the old pranks) and more focus on the family / dating relationships of the old men. This movie is funny and definitely worth watching. You'll have to decide on your own if it's better than the original. Back For More!; CONTAINS SPOILERS John Gustafson and Max Goldman are back in their first adventure since their last. It's six months later and they're still fishing. All the snow has melted and the neighborhood looks very different. The boys are out to catch a giant legendary fish they've heard tell about.          These men would soon discover big changes happening. Like, their friend Chuck, who died in the last adventure, had operated the bait shop. Ever since his demise, it's been empty, but some people have come with plans to turn it into a ristorante (restaurant). They are: Mama Regetti and daughter Maria. John and Max don't want that to happen so they pull numerous pranks on the Regettis but they still won't leave.         Jacob Goldman and Melanie Gustafson contemplate matrimony. But have their doubts when their fathers insist on planning the event. But when the kids decide the wedding is off, John and Max are back at it. Pulling all sorts of foolish pranks on one another. Max steals John's outboard motor, John wrecks Max's fish net and has his cat scratch up Max's car seats, but Max sends a big dog through John's house. Ariel decides to leave for a while. John was in a real pickle. He tried asking his father for advice, but he had passed away; Max goes on a date with Maria and they decide they like one another.        Pretty soon, it's a wedding day. En route to the church, Max and John decide to fish for the giant musket they're so fond of. They catch it, but John says they must leave it in the lake out of respect for his father, so they do and rush to church. It looks like the wedding of Jacob and Melanie, but it isn't. They eloped. It's the wedding of Max and Maria. John planted Max's dog in the limo as they drive off.        Was this as good as the first? Sure. I'm sorry to say that the three main stars, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith are no longer with us. Meredith died in 1998, Matthau in 2000 and Lemmon in 2001, which is real sad. So it's guarenteed there will never be an Even Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple III. They were really funny men. Why do the good ones always gotta die? But anyway, if you're a fan of these men and you enjoyed the first one, then I recommend Grumpier Old Men! - Delightful acting and script but silly scenes...; Always delighting in Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, warmed by their aging and childish pranks, I enjoyed this film which is filled with delightful acting and fun script.It suffers, however,  from more than a few silly scenes. Funnier than the first!; This movie is downright hilarious with tons of good one-liners. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (may they both rest in peace) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max &amp; John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says \"Holy moly\" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor! Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. One of the best movies of 1995!; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. 7/10 stars. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Grumpy, but not funny; What, I wonder, does the legendary Billy Wilder think of this film starring Lemmon and Matthau, the great team he so memorably paired in 1966's \"The Fortune Cookie\"?  Wilder's film is a dark, cynical satire, and was the first of what is now seven films starring the pair.  Seven films, but only two of them--\"The Fortune Cookie\" and \"The Odd Couple\"--are genuinely funny efforts showcasing these actors' combined talents.  \"Grumpy Old Men\" was mildly amusing due less to the script than to the welcome return of Lemmon and Matthau who hadn't been on screen together in 12 years.  The unexpected box-office bonanza naturally inspired a sequel, but all this equally lucrative outing has in its favor is a brief monologue by Burgess Meredith who, as Lemmon's 95-year-old father, boasts of eating bacon and smoking Camels while the \"experts\" who warned against such vices are taking a \"dirt nap.\"  Not even Lemmon and Matthau can enliven the script by Mark Steven Johnson this time around.  The curmudgeonly Matthau admitted he didn't lke the script for the first film but did it to work with Lemmon, and that the only reason he did the sequel is because the first film was a hit.  No doubt, \"Grumpiest Old Men,\" the inevitable sequel, will be just as dreary. If these pictures make big bucks, why tamper with the formula?  Why hire Billy Wilder to punch up the quality when the public seems content merely to see Lemmon and Matthau rather than see them at their best? \"Good Lemmon &amp; Matthau Comedy Sequel!\"; Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Kevin Pollack, Daryl Hannah and Burgess Meredith star in this 1995 comedy sequel. This takes place about 6 months later where John (Lemmon) is now married to Ariel (Margret) and he and Max (Matthau) are sort of getting along. This time, Max finds romance when he meets Maria Ragetti (Loren), an Italian widow who moves into town and opens a restaurant. Jacob (Pollack) and Melanie (Hannah) are also engaged and things start to get a bit difficult for them which makes their dads feud with each other, but only temporarily. The late, Meredith (Rocky) also returns as John's father and this was his final film. This is a good sequel and like the first film, it provides laughs and a bit of heartfelt moments as well. I recommend this. It has it's moments; Howard Deutch decided he wanted to cash in on the success of Grumpy Old Men and it worked. The only problem to the sequel is that some of the cast seem to be a bit bored by the proceedings. The one liners are enough to make you drop your popcorn. Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon are a joy to watch as they continue to find ways to drive each other over the edge into insanity. And yet Deutch calms that insanity by giving us a quick glimpse into just how much these two men mean to each other when Jack's dad played by Burgess Meredith dies. Lemmon and Mathau are still at the top of their game in this film. In this film the Ann Margaret character is suppose to be the rock, the sound of reason, the calm in the midst of the storm. You believe she is until she has the insanity thrust upon her and is forced to react. For the most part Ann Margaret as well as Daryl Hannah seem bored throughout the entire film. Kevin Pollack is just as good in this sequel as in the original. Burgess Meredith is the scene stealer, he manages with dead pan accuracy to deliver some of the best one liners in the film. Ann Morgan Guilbert manages to match Burgess with her ability to respond to his one liners with shock and outrage befitting her character. And then you come to Sophia. Sophia is in her comfort zone here. Sophia is comfortable with the slapstick comedy and relishes it, she's in the movie, she's not walking through it. She's absolutely stunning to watch but at the same time she adds to the moment. She's as glamorous as ever but it doesn't get in the way. All in all a good follow up to the original. A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances...; A sequel to the thoroughly enjoyable Grumpy Old Men, 'Grumpier Old Men' is A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances. The sequel has the spirit of its prequel &amp; the amazing cast, led by the impeccable talents of the Late/Great Jack Lemmon &amp; the Late/Great Walter Matthau, are in full form! 'Grumpier Old Men' Synopsis: John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. 'Grumpier Old Men' works well as a romantic-comedy, as it has moments of humour &amp; subtle romance. I loved the prequel &amp; I must say, the sequel doesn't fail to deliver. The film has sustained its energy &amp; wit, that one would expect from it. Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is entertaining, although initially the pace is slightly slow. Howard Deutch's Direction is top-class. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is good. Editing also is ably done. Performance-Wise: Lemmon &amp; Matthau shine all through. Its their sheer on-screen chemistry, that alone is worth watching the entire film. Sophia Loren is top-notch. Ann-Margret is impressive. Kevin Pollak &amp; Daryl Hannah leave a mark. Late/Great Burgess Meredith is memorable in his part. On the whole, 'Grumpier Old Men' is a smooth, relaxing watch. forget the fussing; As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Sweet and Sad; In this bright sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\" we find John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) at it again. The rivalry never stops. This time, they are bickering over their children's nuptials, almost causing a wedding not to occur. Sophia Loren co-stars as Maria in this foray into the land of 10,000 lakes as the new girl in town that Max has an eye for. At first, they both hate one another because she is turning his beloved tackle shop into a restaurant. Comedy ensues as Max and John both try to get the restaurant shut down and condemned. Eventually, as in the first film, love finds a way. However, sadness veils over as well when Burgess Meredith's character dies. Other than that, the film is very enjoyable. great; This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in 1995, 2 years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie 8 out of 10. Grumpier Old Men Too Sedate *; While Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were an excellent team, they bombed in this film but good. What's so grumpy about Lemmon in this film? The prequel was much better. Ann Guilbert, as Sophia Loren's mother, is given little to do. Remember her as the grandmother to \"The Nanny?\" Sophia Loren, other than marrying Matthau, is also give nothing to do. Ditto for Ann-Margret, Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak, all of whom were so good in the original but are reduced to practically nothing here. I also resent Matthau, who shows off his part-Jewish heritage marrying in a church at the end. I found this to be offensive. Sorry, but that's the way I am-old fashioned. To all those criticize me for the last statement, how would you have felt if the Matthau-Loren nuptials had taken place in a synagogue? While I realize that this was a comedy, this still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. A non-religious setting would have been the only solution to this. Sophia, twenty years later at 80, is still spectacular.; I saw a picture of Sophia on her eightieth birthday, demurely covering herself with a sheet and a heart-melting smile. All I could think of was the scene where she hitched up her bra and marched through the bar, and every man looked, and I do mean every man. I read later that she had \"improved\" the script for that. A reviewer in the SF Chronicle wrote later that she said she had had no \"touch- ups\", and if so then \"her genes need investigating.\" I remember her many films where her beauty was so natural that it was a wonder any man could concentrate on his lines. She never traded on it, but on her talent as an actress. Carlo Ponti was a lucky man: beauty without guile, talent without pretense. Italian pizza were like street food. When she heard we had so many pizza parlors, she thought we must be a poor country. Then she visited, and dined on American pizza. She reconsidered, gracefully and graciously. The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from 1995. The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe 8yrs old, and must have seen it over 100 x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it 15 minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. charming and funny light romantic comedy; It may be just me but I found Grumpier Old Men way way better than Grumpy Old Men. I laughed more and got involved in the plot much more. That it is totally 100% predictable every step of the way is only one of its charms... its how you get there where the fun is. And these actors turn in surprisingly memorable performances for such a slight film. I thought Sophia Loren turned in one of her most charming and funny performances, as did everyone else. The story was just more interesting and three dimensional than the first film and flowed more organically. The story line is simple ancient classic romantic comedy that these veterans had done so many times, it seemed for them like doing a well-known dance. The fun is not in surprises but in going through the old steps with joy. The actors move through their paces with simplicity and enthusiasm and the film actually captures very well the effects of love. The whole film hangs together and works in a way that, for me, the first one didn't. It gets airborne. It deserves a higher ranking than my seven except the story is a little too well-worn. It also allows the two protagonists to get a little more real with each other. Even the three charismatic animal actors get caught up in the spirit of fun. One thing about the film that gave me trouble was that all four women being courted in the film are talented, accomplished, strong and magnificent while all four of the men are hamstrung. I found it mysterious that these women, dropped by some miracle into this tiny town, would be so strongly attracted. Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. Mini Ha Has In Minnesota; It's just possible that the intention was to shoot four Grumpy Old Men titles featuring the four seasons because after the Winter setting of the first one we are now in Summer though theoretically such a cycle should have begun with Spring and ended with Winter so maybe the cyclical thing was an afterthought. Whatever we have virtually the same cast doing virtually the same thing with one absentee and two replacements one of which, Anna Guilbert is actually a native of Minneapolis adding a touch of authenticity. If it was unrealistic that Ann Margaret - who, after all, was teaching English at university and would by definition have access to dozens of eligible males - would marry Jack Lemmon in the first film it is equally unrealistic that Sophia Loren would wed Walter Mattheau here other than for feelgood reasons. On the other hand it's probably churlish to nitpick in this way when the film is only intended to entertain. Which it does. the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. The good, the bad, and the just plain miserable...again; It's not uncommon for a movie sequel to do little to the formula that made its predecessor so financially (and hopefully critically) successful. The old \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" method of filmmaking has been used in the Hangover, Home Alone, and Taken franchise to only modest success in terms of quality. However, in Grumpier Old Men, the sequel to the fine comedy Grumpy Old Men, handles the rehashed formula better than many film sequels do. While I'm getting to sound repetitive and out of descriptive words, this is largely because of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's chemistry together on-screen. From the moment they appear, it's almost impossible to believe the men's friendship in real life wasn't lifelong and consisted largely of playful torment, vulgarity, and several boys nights out. Had the film been a sequel with few returning cast members (say Lemmon and Matthau were substituted by two other actors), this sequel would've likely been a somber affair to view. In a way, I'm thankful the town of Wabasha Minnesota hasn't really changed much since our last outing, with the exception of John Gustafson (Jack Lemon) marrying Ariel (Ann-Margret) from the original film. In the meantime, John's dad still lives off a diet of beer, cigarettes, and bacon and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), John's cantankerous neighbor, still finds himself engaging in petty neighborhood battles with John about outwitting the other man. However, the big ordeal this time is not competing for a new neighbor's love but trying to save a local bait shop from becoming a \"restaurante\" for Italian cuisine. The restaurant is managed by Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren), a gorgeous but uncompromisingly strict woman who catches the eye of Max even as him and Jack plan to foil the restaurant's forthcoming prosperity. Other events (aka subplots) occurring in Wabasha are the wedding between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah), a plot which would later be used by the same director Howard Deutch in The Odd Couple II, also starring Lemmon and Matthau, along with John trying to get his father (Burgess Meredith in his final role, which was burdened by spouts with Alzheimer's and difficultly remembering lines, some female company as he gets older. One of Grumpier Old Men's immediate issues is that there is simply too much going on between plot-strands that involve marriage/romance troubles (I counted four including John's brief trouble with Ariel later in the movie) ad others that involve trying to sabotage the bait-shop-turned-restaurant. Grumpier Old Men may have too many new ideas for cutesy subplots, but it keeps the tone and feel of its predecessor alive and well. It still feels like Wabasha is the location of a sitcom with its oddball situations that seem to consistently bear hefty consequences for its residents, but its characters still feel like real people we've come to known and care about. Unsurprisingly, Lemmon and Matthau share unbelievable conversational beauty in the way they engage in simple discussions that seem to constantly end in uproariously funny bickering. Once you minimize your focus on that aspect in the film, you have just an average comedy that, while charming and pleasantly safe (a good and bad quality for this particular kind of picture), is just grateful to be buoyed by two very talented leading men. Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Sophia Loren, and Burgess Meredith. Directed by: Howard Deutch. Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the 1st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10 Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. 2/5 stars - John Ulmer Great!; This is a rare sequel. Wait a minute, sequels aren't rare. Well, that's true, but a *good* sequel is rare. Most of the time, sequels aren't even in the same league as the originals. However, due to excellent writing, a superb cast and great direction, this film is every bit as enjoyable as Grumpy Old Men. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made several films together and they worked together extremely well. The gorgeous Ann Margaret reprises her role from the first film and is now Lemmon's wife. A new lady hits town and Matthau is very interested. This lovely creature is played by Sophia Loren, who is still stunningly beautiful. Burgess Meredith is great as Grandpa. The stellar cast ensures great acting. However, this film is also written such that there is literally a laugh nearly every minute. I found the film to be highly enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh. 1/10; this movie sucked! I hate it! It's so boring! The acting is so bad! Why does Sophia Loren's italian character talk english to her italian mother when they're alone? The script is so bad! It's so corny! Max and John fighting with the fishing things is so silly! This movie was never funny! It was painful to watch, i'm telling you! Avoid it! Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Oh, How The Mighty Have Fallen...; GRUMPY OLD MEN (3 outta 5 stars) GRUMPIER OLD MEN (2 outta 5 stars) I dunno why I even bothered to watch the second one. Oh, I guess because it was on cable TV shown as a double bill with the original \"Grumpy Old Men\". I liked the original when I first saw it. It was not the best work by the Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau team... but it had its moments... these two actors could probably read pages from the phone book to each other and still make it funny. Unfortunately, the sequel has even FEWER of those moments. Still, I maintain that no movie with either Lemmon OR Matthau in it can be *totally* worthless. This is probably as close as they ever got, though. (Bear in mind that I have not yet seen their last movie together, \"The Odd Couple II\".) Practically the same plot as the first movie... Lemmon and Matthau play lifelong acquaintances and next door neighbors who are constantly bickering about fish and/or women. Burgess Meredith plays Lemmon's FATHER... and if you find old people talking dirty hilarious then you'll probably love his scenes (especially in the closing credits outtakes). Ann Margaret and Sophia Loren play the women in the grumpy guys' lives... hard to imagine that women as attractive as they still are would want anything to do with these two old dorks but, hey... I guess pickings are slim after 65. The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down. Pretty Dang Funny; John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. We often expect sequels to be weaker than the original. But sometimes we may be pleasantly surprised. In this sequel, the \"grumpy old men\" are still up to their old tricks, going after each other and teaming up to close down a restaurant. Some of it may be a bit far-fetched (in real life, a store owner would get the cops involved) but it's good fun. Sadly, the film has the distinction of being Burgess Meredith's final film. On the plus side, he really goes out with a bang. His acting and delivery of witty lines is top notch, and the film does a great job of hiding his Alzheimer's. You can really feel the talent in his character. Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Grumpier Old Men (1995) **1/2; More of the same for those who enjoyed the first film, nothing great but a decent time killer. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return in their twilight years as the ever-battling duo, but this time with the added attraction of Sophia Loren who still looks gorgeous at age 60. She winds up posing a threat to their favorite bait and tackle shop when she decides to take it over and turn it into an Italian restaurant. Since Lemmon's already got sexy Ann-Margret as his hot girlfriend, Sophia hits it off with old man Matthau (ah, the magic of movies), who does not look as good for his age (75). Burgess Meredith is better used in this one in his role as Lemmon's naughty old pop. **1/2 out of **** Cute sequel that works; Fun story of two older men who never quite outgrew boyhood, and the ladies they love. What a treat to see two master actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, working with silly material and enjoying every minute of it. The lady loves, Ann Margret and the ever-sexy and dazzling Sophia Loren, do equally well with a lightweight, sometimes over-the-top script. The principals are aided by a uniformly fine supporting cast, including Burgess Meredith as the Lemmon character's outrageously lecherous dad, and Ann Morgan Guilbert as Sophia's feisty mama. The older players' interaction is a delight. My only quibble with this film is the fact that Meredith's character dies without getting married like everyone else. Why? I wondered whether Meredith had perhaps expired during filming, but, according to Wikipedia, the actor lived a whole two years following this movie's release! The original film, \"Grumpy Old Men,\" takes place during a picturesque Minnesota winter, with snow used to charming effect. The follow-up capitalizes on a Midwestern summer. Like apples and oranges, both productions satisfy. A vibrant sequel that's still underwhelming; I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They seem to work perfectly together, and with a better script, this movie could be gold. We are taken back to Minnesota to re-visit the old grumps who now have to plan a wedding for their very plain and very boring children. There's a reason Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah have never had substantial film careers- they're very uninteresting actors. But I digress. If \"Grumpy Old Men\" built up it's laughs, \"Grumpier Old Men\" topples them down. The best moments of both films are when Lemmon and Matthau trade vicious insults at one another, and also play pranks on each other. But when this is taken away, we're suffering every old cliché in the book, including Walter's tiresome 'Wholey Moley' line which is used so much, it could be taken into context for a Shot Party (take a shot every time Matthau 'Wholey Moley''s himself). The other problem with this series is the fact that gorgeous women fall for these two farts. Roger Ebert made a very valid point in his review for this film- first Ann-Margaret moves into the neighborhood and marries Jack Lemmon. Now the even more gorgeous Sophia Loren has set her sights on the incredibly unattractive Matthau. And why? For concepts in the plot. There's no reason a woman as beautiful and intelligent as Loren would fall for the dull and disgusting figure Matthau is. I know this is a comedy, but come on now! All in all this sequel is peppier and a little more fun then the original, but both movies suffer from overblown dramatic passages that are not needed. We want to see the old guys go at it, not Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah. I laughed a lot at this movie- mostly at the incredibly underrated Bergis Meredith as the foul-mouthed Grandpa. Since all three main actors have passed, we'll never see them again. At least Margaret and Loren are still alive and kicking. I'd love to see their movie: \"Grumpy Old Widows\". As Good As The Original; Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\". I don't agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love \"Buddy Buddy\" and \"The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile. after you have seen the first there is no point seeing this one; After the fun of watching Lemmon and Matthau act like kids for less than 2 hours (i.e. from the first movie) I was satisfied, but then due to the success of the first movie the producers decided to give it another twirl, this time the story had the two starting off as friends thanks to the incidents that happened in the ending of the first film, but then some really really idiotic stupid reason, they were at it again. The movie was not funny as it was like a replay of the first, same pranks, similar plot and screenplay made this movie a waste of time. After getting a mate for John, they (the producers) decided to get a mate for Max, with nothing to write home about but a lame script that just showed no finesse or true plan, just the producers hoping to bank on the success of the previous movie. The main disappointment in the movie for me was Sophia Loren; her acting was just too weak for me to understand that she is a star. Everybody else in the movie even Burgess Meredith (who had Alzheimer's disease and this was his last motion picture appearance) was impressive, at least that I can give them. The movie is directed this time by Howard Deutch, who later worked with the duo in 1998 for Odd Couple II, Deutch other movies also have not been well received like Getting Even with Dad (1994) and The Whole Ten Yards (2004), which are basically the reason why I will not bother seeing My Best Friend's Girl. The movie plot carries on 6 months after the incidents of the first, where both John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) were getting prepared for the wedding of their children. Then a new arrival in town a beautiful lady by the name of Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) came in to change things by turning the towns bait shop to a restaurant. John and Max join forces to try and run the new lady out of town, but the issues between John and Max's children marriage plan caused both to reignite their feud as both refused to believe that their child was at fault. Only the ladies are alive till today (February 2013), as both Lemmon and Matthau died like half a decade after this movie release. Grumpier Old Men was a box office success in its own part, but a huge critical disappointment, as the movie cost 10 million dollars less than its predecessor and made like a million more in the box office. After you have seen the first there is basically no point why you should bother seeing this one, because it will stand in my mind as one movie I credit as a waste of time and talent. www.lagsreviews.com Good Laughs; Grumpier Old Men (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to Grumpy Old Men have Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau returning with more fights and foul language. This time out Lemmon is still happily married but Matthau is on the move and takes a special interest in an Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved to town. I think the most remarkable thing about this film is how well Loren looked. Even at 61 she's still a head turner and her comic timing isn't too bad either. I'm sure this film was only made because the first one made money but it doesn't really matter as no one should take this too serious as it's just a silly comedy meant to make you laugh. There are plenty of nice laughs here but I don't think it's as good as the original. This certainly isn't in the league as The Odd Couple but we do get a pretty good throwback to that film here as there's a scene where Lemmon has to spend the night with Matthau but can't put up with his dirty house. Ann-Margret returns but is pretty much wasted as is Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak. The perverted Burgess Meredith is back and steals the scene every time he's in it. Both Matthau and Lemmon are naturally very good and they easily slip back into their roles. It's priceless watching the two men work together even when the material isn't as strong as one would hope. Lemmon gets a special notice here due to a very touching scene with Meredith. Another problem is the direction, which has one of those \"made for TV\" feels to it. In the end this film could have and should have been a lot better but the cast make it worth watching. Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT 7 out of 10 OLDER, HORNIER AND STILL FRUSTRATED IN MINNESOTA;  `Grumpier Old Men' is a film that is a sequel to `Grumpy Old Men.' Reprising their original roles are Jack Lemmon as John Gustafson, Walter Matthau as Max Goldman, Ann Margaret as Ariel, Burgess Meredith as John's father, Kevin Pollock and Darryl Hannah as the children of Max and John. They are still next-door neighbors, only now the feud has subsided. Their children are living across the street in Ariel's house.  The marriage of their children is on the horizon. The setting for this film is summer and fall in Minnesota.  Fishing is still the main sport where `Catfish Hunter' is still the elusive prize.  The bait shop on the lake has been closed since Chuck passed away.  It is now under new management.  John and Max are anxiously waiting the reopening.  To their surprise, it is not being reopened as a bait shop, but a ristorante (restaurant).  Here enters Sophia Loren as the new proprietress Maria Sophia Calotti Ragetti.  Ann Guilbert who plays her mother joins her.  When Max and John find out the new plans for their favorite bait shop, they set out to undermine her plans for a grand opening.  A series of misunderstandings set off a domino effect that touches everyone's lives.  New loves are found and an old feud is rekindled. All of the same emotions that were in the previous film are in this film. There is laughter, sadness, anger and happiness.  Catfish Hunter makes his film debut, which, in essence, puts a `face' with a name.  His film appearance pays credence to the fact that he is a `real' fish and not just a myth.   The acting in this film is superb both by human and non-human.  Still having a good ol' time!; I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men back to back, so I could see both instead of my normal rent one sequel at a time ordeal. I just finished Grumpier Old Men this morning and was expecting a modest sequel, but it turned into a great sequel, pretty much to the point where I enjoyed Grumpier Old Men to Grumpy Old Men. Despite the fact that they use some old jokes, this was a fun plot and I thought the guys have gotten even funnier, including John's father, he's a little dirty, but so much fun to laugh at. John and Max are now best friends again and couldn't be happier with each other, their son and daughter are about to get hitched, and they are overwhelming with the wedding plans. Max is starting to get lonely though, since Chuck has passed on, the bait shop is given to two older Italian women, one lady, Maria, starts a little feud with Max wanting to turn the bait shop into a restaurant. But their anger turns into a hidden passion and they end up falling head over heals for each other, but Maria has some hidden skeletons in her closet. Grumpier Old Men is proof that you are never too old to fall in love or have your heart broken again. It was so sweet seeing Max fall in love with Maria, I loved their passion for each other, it was so fun to watch. John's father and Maria's mother were just so awesome and funny, they had such great chemistry! I would highly recommend Grumpier Old Men, it's a great comedy that once again touches your heart and tickles your funny bone. 8/10 funny funny; I, too, found the film very funny and until reading about it here couldn't remember who played the other woman with Burgess Meredith at the end of the film, the scene that made the whole film complete.  Without giving away what happened at the end of the film, the other woman was that gorgeous elder lady of many great films - Sophia Loren.  What a delicious surprise!  Good also for any old grumpy man! Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter &amp; Jack's previous films together. It was this film &amp; the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max &amp; John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. A sequel that's equal to the original comedy; The first go round was such a hit, that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau got together for this sequel to the 1993 smash hit, \"Grumpy Old Men.\" And \"Grumpier Old Men\" is every bit as good as the first film. It has some new characters and the scene changes from winter to summer, then winter and spring. Most reviewers don't talk about the surprise of the wedding in the first film. And I won't do that for that film or this one. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) team up for a time in the movie to plan the wedding of their daughter and son, Melanie and Jacob (played by Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak). And, later, to try to thwart the conversion of their bait shop into an Italian restaurant. Sophia Loren is the added ingredient for much humor as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti. She's a cousin of \"Spaghetti\" Ragetti, whom John and Max know. Her mother is in the picture, Mama Ragetti, played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. And, grandpa Gustafson is back, with Burgess Meredith now a couple years older. He tells son, John, as they sit by the lake drinking beer, that he sometimes thinks God has forgotten about him. The hijinks and capers in this film include some hilarious pranks the two friendly enemies pull on the Ragettis. As with the original film, this one supposedly takes place in Wabasha, Minnesota. While it is a real town on the Mississippi River border with Wisconsin, the filming for this and the earlier movie was done in a number of places around that area of southeastern Minnesota. So, anyone going to Wabasha won't find the fishing lake, the town overlook or some other scenes shown in these films. With the 10 films they made together  especially the nine comedies, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have delighted audiences for decades. May they outlive Catfish Hunter and continue amuse people for decades to come. Loren is still hot; Grumpy old men was an OK comedy with a nice performance by Ann-Margret, but otherwise forgettable. This film, on the other hand, has some real comic touches that actually also have something to say about the aging process - and life really doesn't end until it ends. But first the bad news: Daryl Hannah. I've liked her in other films, but she is so flat in this, she's a distraction. She doesn't have the feel for these characters, not even her own, and so doesn't quite fit. She's not even credible as the mother of the young girl who is so important in her relationship to great=grand-dad Burgess Meredith. There must have been some plot device they could have come up with to leave her out of the picture altogether; oh, well. Now the really good news: Sophia Loren. I admit I have always had a crush on her since I saw Houseboat as a kid; and when I saw the shower scene in Arabesque, i couldn't sleep for a week. Her performance here is splendid (romantic comedy is one of her strengths, after all), but the really really good news is that she was past sixty when she made this film, and she looks hot enough to burn a young man's fingers! Really - if I'd been Walter Matthau in that bar scene, I'd have gone out with a heart-attack right there - and smiling. With an adequate script, and such superb actors, Deutsch wisely lets the formula roll on without interference. Consequently, whatever the short-comings there's plenty to remember fondly from this film. Oh, and don't miss the blooper-reel that runs under the final credits - Matthau and Meredith are having a grand old time. Oh, and Sophia Loren is still hot. not much fun; Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still combative while maintaining their truce. John is married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) now and his father (Burgess Meredith) is still spry. Everybody is chasing after the big fish Catfish Hunter. Meanwhile, their children Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are planning to get married. Newcomer Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in Wabasha to buy the bait shop and turn it into an Italian restaurant. It's a continuation that's missing much of the fun. It is contrived. It's great to see these great actors working together but that's all I got out of it. I found very few laughs. Who would have ever guessed that it's the same place?; For the most part, \"Grumpier Old Men\" is pretty silly. Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still at each other's throats when Italian immigrant Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in town and throws everything into flux. What actually struck me most about the movie was how different the town looked in this one from the original. Obviously, it was a different time of year, but maybe the different look was meant to show how everything might be changing in the town. Other than that, Ann-Margret returns as Ariel, and she's still as free-spirited and vivacious as she was in the original. Burgess Meredith - in his final role - is still the grandfather who can exercise absolute authority over the youngsters, although he now has the hots for Maria's mother (Ann Morgan Guilbert, aka Millie on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\"). Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah also reprise their roles from the original...ah, and there's that fish. All in all, a fairly interesting movie. Not any kind of masterpiece, but it showed that Lemmon and Matthau still had it. Snoozing sequel with the leads in need of some No-Doz; Woeful, disappointing sequel to 1993's hit \"Grumpy Old Men\" is more retread than follow-up. The two crotchety neighbors--Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--bicker over their children (who will soon be making the sparring oldsters in-laws!) and, of course, who has the better fishing skills. They stop trading insults long enough for Matthau to begin irritating a new woman in town, a fiery Italian who has just opened her own restaurant. Sitcom humor with a sometimes-raunchy twist that is no longer fresh. Almost worth-seeing for Sophia Loren's funny, lively performance, but everyone else looks a little sleepy. Ann-Margret (who married Lemmon's character at the end of the original) must've dropped in for a day and a half to complete her work. As the youthful couple, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah are also under-used. ** from **** A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life &amp; Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau &amp; Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman &amp; John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a 7.4 out of 10 As equally funny as the original, but with an Italian flair!!!!; This sequel to Grumpy Old Men is as funny as the original. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and the rest of the cast from the original movie reprise their roles. John and Max are still feuding, but the tension between them has softened. There are, however, some changes: Ariel and John are married and there's a new girl in town named Maria Ragetti. She's moved to Wabasha to open up an Italian restaurant at the former Chuck's Bait place. When the boys discover what Maria's intentions are, they hatch a scheme to ruin the grand opening of the restaurant and try to keep Chuck's business going, even though the inventory of the former business has been cleared out and the interior remodeled to look like an Italian restaurant. Max and Sophia meet, but there's a disagreement about what the place should be. Maria goes to the neighborhood bar to try and reason with Max, but to no avail. It seems as though Max and John have trouble saying goodbye to what is no longer there. The humor between Lemmon and Matthau's characters is still spiced up and is still able to put viewers in stitches. Then, Max and Maria get married, and the restaurant starts selling bait, as well.

       "      <td>An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Feel Good Movie; The acting in this film is phenomenal, especially on the part of Angela Bassett who always does an amazing job (see What's Love Got To Do With It). The inter-cuts work well where they are placed, much like all of the other shots, and keep the films pace and the viewer interested. I've read other user comments and I find their opinions to be completely biased and unwarranted. If you're watching this film looking for profound insight to life you will be disappointed. This film is an adaptation of Terry McMillan's critically acclaimed novel FOR BLACK FEMALES. Waiting to Exhale explores the lives of four female friends. Each woman makes mistakes and has to deal with those consequences. But it is through being there for one another that they overcome these problems and others. For me, most of the negative user comments are from people who the film was not made for, that are only analyzing the film from the story. There is more to a film than it's narrative and when base your full opinion on that alone you are missing out. Plus, for me, it's just flat-out annoying when people who are completely not the target audience bash a film. Note: this is not to say that art cannot breach color, age or sex barriers. But be let's be realistic for a moment. If say, a heterosexual, black, 21 year old female studying Art was asking you for a good movie suggestion for a Friday night...Would you suggest The Dukes Of Hazard? I think not. Not unless you were joking. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Excellent for the broken heart...; Perhaps the reason they call this movie a chick flick, is because that's exactly who it's aimed at. Women. I don't see this as a man bashing movie, but more as a \"how do you deal?\" type of movie. It covers every situation: The unworthy co-worker, The drug-addict boyfriend, the gay husband, the cheating husband, the married man, the New Years fling, the sweet attractive neighbor, the teenage son....but most importantly, it show how women react and deal with the lies, the cheating, and the friendships between both men AND women...and how to survive from that. Any woman who has ever gone through a relationship can relate to this movie, regardless of race, situation, or age. You will want to scream, cry and laugh throughout the whole movie, and I can guarantee that every woman has got a little Angela Bassett in her, especially when she rips through her ex-husbands belongings. Two thumbs up...A definite must-see for any woman with a wounded heart. Don't Exhale Just Yet; I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It's not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others, it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However, the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria -- even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger, Holly Hunter, Alfre Woodard and others. Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight, insecure no-nonsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight, but she was the only one who found it (and deserved it). She was the only one who didn't sleep around, wasn't a man basher, set a good example for her son, and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face -- look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things, her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent, good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie. Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package --- beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life - she could now start her catering business, she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end. Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book, you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men. Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same -- Whitney Houston being well groomed, pretending to be well spoken and classy, and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise (although she might have been too young). The character had to tell us she was smart -- in a phone conversation with her mother she said \"I'm smart, I'm a good person and I work hard.\" Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills, doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end. This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn't \"tell this story\" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were. Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue? Extra in Movie; I was actually an extra in this movie and had a quite a fun time hanging out w/the cast/crew. I had an opportunity to be at several of the locations for days of filming and it was a lot of work. You don't realize what a day of filming entitles until you actually do it and I was just an extra. I was more interested in the process of the film making than being on camera so it was a great opportunity. I even got \"spoiled\" and met a lot of the cast and drove around in the SUV's that are for the main cast...fun stuff! I think over all the movie was to enjoy for fun. I think the basis of the friendships were the most important aspect of the film. That through all the craziness of men in their lives they were still there for one another. This film does Terry McMillan's writing no justice; This movie had great potential had it landed in the right directors hands (as seen with How Stella got Her Groove Back).  Many rough cuts, sloppy editing, and terrible lighting at times to name a few.  Casting was excellent with the exception of Whitney Houston who has the tendency to over-chew her scenes.  Though much of the book was not adapted to the film the strength and love amongst four friends was apparent.  It was the one thing that was not lost or left on the cutting room floor.  Good movie, better book. Waiting to Exhale (the movie) ***** (5 stars) Waiting to Exhale (the novel) ********** (ten stars) A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops &amp; horrible movies. My favorite movie ever !; I'm so surprised by the comments i read here. Since i saw that movie maybe 10 years ago now, it's one of my favorite movie ever along with boomerang.Maybe it's because i was fairly young when i watched those movies.. but i find them extremely good. I watched the movie before i read the book and it may be the reason why i loved the movie so much. Sure Whitney's acting could have been better but she managed to do a pretty decent job overall. As for the soundtrack it's a pure bliss for RnB lovers and i would say a classic now. The image of Black men in the movie is very negative but in a sens it pushed to be the exact opposite so it kinda shaped my vision and my life, and \"deepend\" my love of black women. Some parts of the movie are just so classic like the break up between Robin and troy on the balcony and the soundtrack at that moment was some kind of a symphony.. anyways great great movie .. enjoy Double Standard; So I finally got around to watching \"Waiting to Exhale\" on Encore the other night and I don't understand why this became a hit. (Note: spoilers ahead) As far as I can tell, the basic premise of this film is that all men are insensitive, callous and unfeeling; especially towards women. Okay, well and good. That is the storyline? Fine. Men suck, got it. But there is a huge double standard here; two of the women are dating married men and clearly, we are meant to be sympathetic about their plight as they whine and cry about not having \"their\" man with them at night in bed. How about this? STOP DATING MARRIED MEN! Maybe that's your problem in the first place. Now, on the flip side, Angela Basset's character is abandoned by her husband for another woman. Yet, if you pay attention, even this character is not completely innocent. When her husband informs her he is leaving, the things she says makes it clear she's known about his lover(s) for years but ignored his infidelities. Why? Obviously, because he's so wealthy. She liked all the \"stuff\" a little too much to have confronted him about it. Again, she's made her bed here, not as completely as the two who are actively cheating, but still. She spends the rest of the movie being so angry that he left her you never really grow to like her. Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer; he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar. With their clothes on, which apparently means it's oh-so-platonic and sweet. Then he writes her a letter months later, thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off, he'll contact her again. Did anyone else think this was more than a little sleazy? I would hope if I were dying of breast cancer that my husband wasn't out sleeping around (and I do mean just sleeping) with other women. Sweet, platonic, whatever; I think it's pretty horrible. Bottom line; the characters you're supposed to connect to are unlikable and the ones you're supposed to hate are just pathetic. Not very enjoyable. However, I did give it three stars for the music, which didn't suck too badly and the clothes and style. It's a nice little snapshot of how things looked in '95. And the print wasn't very faded. That's about it, though. Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life. Please. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation. A real disaster!; This movie is awful! The caracters are shallow and almost ridiculous, especially Lela Rochon. It's a very, very, very bad soap opera. I was watching this movie with my wife and we were laughing almost all the time. It is much too long, with no rhythm with absolutely no emotions. It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one cliché after another. Skip it, it's a waste of time! A One-Sided Celebration of African American Feminism; Directed by Forest Whitaker and adapted from a smash best selling novel by Terry McMillan, WAITING TO EXHALE is a glossy, but one-sided look at the relationship between four strong black women and the various men in their lives. The film is one-sided because the screenplay presents most of the male characters as sexist, manipulative pigs without a redeeming characteristic in sight, but the sensitive direction and outstanding performances keep the rather lopsided story watchable. Whitney Houston made an impressive film debut as Savannah, an ambitious television executive caught in a dead-end affair with a married man (Dennis Haysbert). Angela Basset does Oscar-worthy work as Bernadine, a woman who has spent her life being the best wife and mother she knows how to be, who has her world rocked when her wealthy husband (Michael Beach) calmly announces one night before a formal dinner party that he's in love with someone else and wants a divorce. The scene where Bernadine gathers all her husband's stuff and makes a bonfire out of it in her driveway is one of the film's highlights. Lela Rochon plays Robin, a not-too-bright doormat who finds herself pregnant by a man she wants nothing to do with. Loretta Devine is fun as Gloria, a hairdresser who is divorced from her husband, who it turns out was gay, and is struggling to raise her son (Donald Faison) and tries to begin a relationship with a new neighbor (Gregory Hines). If you can accept the fact that in the world of these four women, all men are pigs, then this film can be very entertaining but the top-notch performances by the cast cannot be overlooked. FAbuLOuS; Simply fabulous. I thought it was a great movie. I was completely empowered! It made me want to start my exes car on fire. Embrace your independence  watch this movie. (is great to watch with the scorned over glasses of wine and bon bons) It'll make you laugh, cry, get mad, and then plot getting even. I can waste a lot of your time telling you to see it, defending it from what others say about it, or just generally talking it up. But haven't you always wanted to see Angela Basset throw a fit? How bout cut her hair off? And who wouldn't want to watch Whitney act with humility. This is by far my favorite movie with Whitney - second, The Bodyguard - third, The Preachers Wife. Frustrating...; That's the word I'd use to describe the film, an adaptation of Terry McMillan's 1992 best-seller. It's not great, it's not bad, but it's frustrating to watch, and the fact that I'm of the male persuasion undoubtedly had something to do with it. Now, let me be the first to say that I did enjoy seeing a group of strong black women portrayed onscreen. To say that Hollywood has been exceedingly lax in this regard is an understatement. But it would've been nice if their collective talents hadn't been squandered on this disgustingly anti-male tirade. Especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine, who otherwise shine in everything their names are attached to. Good, solid movies about sisterhood are probably needed now more than ever, but not at the cost of shortchanging the good, upright, decent brothers out there, whom this movie largely forgets about (with some notable exceptions -- Gregory Hines, for example.) And the frustration doesn't end there. Both Savannah and Robin manage to find themselves involved with the most shady characters (a married man and a dope fiend, respectively), yet they complain about the lack of good men out there. I suppose it would be silly to question just where they've been looking, even though it might hold the answer. The sad thing is that there are fellas out there who have little to no regard for women (\"the scum of the f__king earth\", to quote Savannah), and women who fall for fellas like that for the most silly, shallow reasons. If it wasn't for Bassett, Devine, and Babyface's score, this movie would barely be watchable. As it is, it's a moderately entertaining diversion, albeit a frustrating one. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE HARD TRUTH) looked VERY beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts REALLY made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. I give this one 2 out of 10. Pathetic; This film is simply about a bunch of women who pick men who's behaviors they claim to hate &amp; then spend the rest of their time complaining about them. It seems that this view is held by many women &amp; possibly accounts in some measure to the number of women who consider their relationships with men to be unsatisfying. Decent; Those of you who ranted and raved about how horrible this film was really tickle my funny bone. I love to see miserable people hate a movie just because...well, they have nothing to better to do. Not saying this was the best movie I've ever seen. But I agree with others who say that Bassett and Levine are the ones to save this film from drowning with all the other horrible movies. I love Angela Bassett, I'm a huge fan of hers. The scene which depicts the morning after her husband leaves her for his secretary, which would've otherwise been too cliché for my taste had it not been for the way Bernie (Bassett) burned up that BMW! I mean that was classic. Sorry if any of you testosterone-fueled men out there will accuse me of man hating, but I love that scene and will watch it over and over again. Three cheers for Angie. And Devine's character, Gloria seems sort of weak and unable to stand up to even her teenage son, but I love how she bends a little and confesses how she feels to the late Gregory Hines' character. You'll notice Devine's Gloria and Bassett's Bernie are slightly juxtaposed but their chemistry is excellent. If you haven't seen it, check it out, if not for anything but the performance of these two gifted actors. Whitney ruined the great potential; Angela Basset was good as expected, but Whitney has no Range as an actress. The screenplay also neglected to portray, on film, the greatness of this novel.  Instead of promoting sisterhood, they emphasized the canine-qualities of men.  Read the book; rent Soul Food instead! Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this 1995 film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Hilarious in Parts; 1995 was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in 1995, the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection great touching story; While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life's mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great. WAITING TO EXHALE : Waiting To Go Somewhere, But Sadly It Never Does...; WAITING TO EXHALE Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. \"Waiting To Exhale\", Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book, had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it's star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene. \"Waiting To Exhale\" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone. It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn't know the word \"feelings\" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change. For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they've experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don't seem to learn squat. It's like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. \"Waiting To Exhale\" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose. ... D ... I wanna move to Arizona; I thought It was a great movie, although it is a lot of sleeping with other women husband that are taken, we all have to be honest, this goes on a lot in reality. it's not right, but it happens.... Overall I really enjoy the movie because it took me way back to 1995, the movie was great. great times, although I was just 11 when it came out, I remember all the hype over this movie from my mom n my aunts.... One factor that I've never notice before was the setting... It makes me wanna pack up my family an move to peaceful Arizona.. Great Movie. r.i.p. Whitney Houston I cannot believe it took me all this time to see this movie all the way through... Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... not bad; this movie and its story are quite good on the whole..........Ms Bassett is the leading and the best actress,for sure.I get her character.she's beautiful and I guess she's blown people away with her beauty and the EASE WITH WHICH SHE FASCINATES.Ms HOUSTON IS NOT TO NEGLECT NEITHER.She looks natural in this one.And despite her little experience as far as her actress career is concerned,she is good even though her story is a bit common .Loretta is divine!Anyways,this motion picture is merely good.There's nothing amazing.And it don't stand out from all the other movies.the only thing that makes me stick to the screen is the complicity and the crude humor on men of the four ladies! A bit too soapy but deserves respect for being a positive film for black women; Vannah is travelling to see her friend Bernie while leaving behind all her old live to start anew.  Bernie has just been left by her husband of 13 years for a white woman.  Robin wants to be loved and happy but always makes the wrong choices.  Glo has an estranged husband and the only man in her life is her teenage son.  The four get together through their struggles in love and live as they try to put it all together again. This is very much a woman's film and, as a man, it's easy for me to criticise it for being a weepy or for being a bit of a woman love in, so I won't.  The plot is pure soap opera, the lives and loves of our 4 women, however it is still involving as the four stories all have strengths as well as weaknesses.  The mix of comedy and sentiment is a bit too much 20:80 and at times the sentiment gets too much, but the sassy characters keep the interest. The soapy sentiment isn't helped by a poor soundtrack and poor use there of. In itself I like some of the love ballad r'n'b stuff  but here it felt like it was all over every scene.  This really bogs it down. Also a down side is the whole man hating thing  only a few come off looking good.  I thought the director being a man would help redress the balance but it seemed to have no effect. Why  can someone tell me  was Houston chosen to lead this talented black cast?  Was it because she could do a cut price soundtrack?  She's a poor actress and he spoiled her scenes  she needs to stay in TVM's.  Bassett however is powerful as ever and really steals every single scene she's in.  Devine adds comedy and sauce while Rochon is perfect as the vulnerable beauty going about love the wrong way.  The male cast is great too  there are so many well known faces in this with only two criticisms of them  1  everytime I see Haysbert now all I can think of is his 24 character.  And 2  Wesley Snipes' character just don't convince me at all. Overall to criticise this for being girly or sentimental is to miss the point.  It is actually good to see a film with so many good roles for black actresses.  It's a bit too soapy for my taste but it is funny and involving with a commanding Bassett.  Only Huston, a soppy soundtrack and constant man caricatures spoil it. The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Sticky; There was nothing in the movie that made me excited. The message did not come through,  if there was one. Perhaps it is to convey the idea that men are useless,  or that relations are complicated because women make it complicated. If a comedy,  I did not laugh.  If a drama,  I did not find it dramatic. It was like drinking a cup of coffee presented to you with way too much sugar. Good movie, Better book; This wasn't a bad movie. The acting was great (although Whitney Houston still seems mediocre). Some of the scenes were powerful and funny. However, unlike the book which also deals with the sisterhood of Black women, the movie becomes a long \"Men are pigs\" tirade that gets weary after a while. Plus it's sometimes hard to root for the characters. For instance, considering all the one-night stands Savannah has, it's hard to see why she's questioning her ability to find a good man. Overall, Waiting to Exhale, is basically a sorely-needed bonding movie for African-American women that, while a little biased, is good escapist fun. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about 15 or 16 and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker. 6 of 10 stars. This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Great female flick of the '90s!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track 6: This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! A 3 is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. Hot Soundtrack, Terrible Character Development; Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end.  It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.  However, much of this is wasted on poor character development.  Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover.  What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies.  While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all.  For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script.  Clearly the answer is that it isn't.  Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with.  Why the director didn't see this, I don't know. Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface. 4/10 Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. in response to your response; I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a 10, i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol \"Father 2\" : Born again.; Okay,now the sequel \"Father Of The Bride 2\",which was surprisingly better than expected. Like anyone who sees a sequel,you expect almost a carbon copy of the first. It does start similar to the first movie,with George sitting in a chair addressing us,the audience. It also does an unfortunate repeat of the fight between Annie &amp; Bryan,again like the first movie,I saw it coming. The baby shower party is not played big,like the first after wedding party but I laughed when actual storks carrying little bundles showed up. I was kind of \"iffy\" on the sub-plot of George selling the house,having to leave in ten days and then blowing a bundle to get it back again. I'm not questioning the probability (we know in reality that'd be impossible),I just found it kind of unnecessary. I did however like his dyed hair and new look,that was hilarious and he should have kept it until the end of the movie. Some may say the idea of a mother &amp; daughter being pregnant at the same time,is impossible. Yet,somehow it works here. It's not just the obvious next step for Annie but for George and his wife too,who thought having babies was way behind them. I love Steve Martin's warped expression when Bryan calls him a \"Grandfather\"! I liked that a woman having a baby in her 40's was taken very seriously,since it's a fact that women who have babies later in life have a more difficult time. It makes for a good piece of drama in a film that's otherwise a family comedy. The comedy is helped once again by the presence of Martin Short and I like that he becomes more involved with the family. Especially helping George out the front door on his back. This after giving him sleeping pills for rest. Once the babies are born and Bryan &amp; Annie head to Boston for a new life,the film gets a very touching ending with George and his new baby girl. 8 out of 10 for the expected repeat of ideas,otherwise a very well made sequel. (END) A (Rare) Good Sequel; The first \"Father of the Bride\" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin's great comedic \"Dad\" character with the emotions of marrying off his \"only\" (to that point!) daughter. However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor. Thankfully, \"Father of the Bride II\" does not fall into this trap. With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather. Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton). Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women! Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments. Whereas the first film captured George's equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George's identity crisis. With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family. Overall, this film is just as good as the original. The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare. Let's just say that if a \"Grandfather of the Bride\" were in the works, I would be first in line. I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. Fantastic; Both the first movie and this sequel are fantastic. I loved the first movie, so I thought I would give the second one a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised!! The acting from all the characters is amazing, from Steve Martin to Diane Keaton to Kimberly Williams-Paisley. 16 years after its release this movie is still a gem. When I'm feeling down or just need a go-to comedy for a night in, these two movies are the best. For those who say that a 40-something woman is too old to have a baby--that's just not true. Do your research. I bet more people have been in that situation than you think. Anyway, this is a feel-good movie for some great laughs and a few happy tears! Average comedy sequel; There's been better, and there's been worse. \"Father of the Bride Part II\" falls right in between when it comes to sequels of comedies. The plot was easily predictable and the movie didn't have as many Steve Martin funny moments as the original. There were some good moments that made me laugh though, most being scenes with Martin Short. It did seem like sort of a stretch, though that all of the sudden \"Frank\" was an interior designer as well as a wedding/baby shower coordinator. I guess they just needed a way to keep him in the movie longer. I was hoping for a lot more when I rented this. My advice: stick to the original. Very Warm and Funny.; This movie is a very warm and funny family film. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the Sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny. The only thing I didn't like was Eugene Levy's character, I found that his part was just put there to extend the movie a bit. I also didn't like how they used him in the second one when he was clearly the one who auditioned to be the wedding singer in the first one. All in all this is a great family film where many will enjoy and watch together. Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! Not as good as the first, but still great fun.; In the sequel to the brilliant Father Of The Bride, Nina Banks and her daughter Annie are both pregnant and George Banks, being his usual nervous self has to learn to get used to the idea that he's going to be a father again AND a grandfather. The whole cast including, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams and Martin Short are all back here giving good performances. Even though Father Of The Bride Part II is not as good as the first Father Of The Bride, this is still a great movie which is enjoyable and fun all the way through and that's why I'm going to give this good sequel a 10/10.  Good, so long as you don't try to think too much; It was a fun movie, but it had no particular substance. I mostly watched it because I'd seen the first one. And because it was free on my cable. Or at least, I wasn't paying only to see it. Now, I have done that before and been pleasantly surprised, but this just wasn't one of those movies. Most of what was in this movie has been done already in the first film, and then it was in a much better way. Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, I'm just glad that I got to watch it free. Sure, Steve Martin's always fun to watch, particularly when he's acting dopey for whatever reason, but that didn't make it a great film. Just mediocre. Still, it's fun for a laugh. Funny Sequel; Geogre Banks is getting used to life without his precious daughter Anne. Now he is thinking about all the free time he will have when his son is out of the house.That`s when Anne announces that she is going to have a baby.Geogre is shocked but he becomes even more shocked when he finds out his wife is going to have baby as well.Now he has to deal Franck helping out with the two pregnant women.Can Geogre ever get a break? This is my second favorite movie.My first is Father of the bride part I.This is a good movie.See it it is a great sequel.It is almost as good as the first one. Steve Martin steals the screen. Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. As I understand it, there were accusations of anti-Arab stereotyping?; \"Father of the Bride II\" may seem to some people like a lesser Steve Martin movie, with him as the patriarch from the previous movie now having to deal with his daughter's and wife's pregnancies. Unpretentiously silly. But one interesting thing is that apparently, some Arab groups claimed that the movie was making anti-Arab stereotypes, as a Middle Eastern man buys their house with plans to demolish it. I wouldn't have interpreted that as anti-Arab; I mean, it's not like they're portraying him as a terrorist. Oh well, life goes on. The movie's a nice, goofy way to pass time. I really liked the scene where they bring Steve Martin into the hospital (that would've sure been an embarrassment!). Also starring Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, B.D. Wong and Eugene Levy. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. good, but a mistake; this movie rocks. but there is one thing weird. okay, so in the beginning Annie says, \"i have lived here since i was 5!\" and then later right when they are selling the house and playing basketball Annie and George(her dad) and her dad says \"i remember the first time we played out here, you were 4.\" wait...so was she 4 or 5 when they moved in??????????? other than that this movie makes me laugh, cry(because i laugh so much), and..........uh.....what was that other thing people say when they say that? i don't really remember. i just love how Steve martin always is so cheap. I am forced to say more so i will say i love that this movie is always on HBO! And i realized something, Steve martin has had white hair like forever! Entertaining, but the premise has been worn thin -- it's sweet, but unnecessary.; The original \"Father of the Bride\" with Spencer Tracey is a really good comedy, the remake starring Steve Martin is a good sweet-natured, amiable enough comedy - and I don't really think a sequel was necessary at all. I mean the whole premise is basically the same - before George Banks (Martin) had to grasp the reality of his daughter being married, and now he has to come to grips with the fact that she's having a baby. A nice twist on this is that his wife (played by Diane Keaton) is ALSO pregnant, but nevertheless it's still (basically) the same as the first film in one form or another. Thankfully it doesn't seem like a total cash-in (like so many sequels of this sort do) because it has a certain charm (as did the first film) and is still remarkably entertaining, all considered. But you can tell it was made solely because of the success of the first film - even Martin Short is back with another extended cameo as Franz the wedding manager. Of course you may be wondering why he's involved with a pregnancy, since his business is weddings. Here's a hint: more $$$ for the studio. Martin is basically doing the same thing he did in the first film - the weary upper-class guy who feels overwhelmed by the state of things. Diane Keaton is still very sweet and likable as his wife. The rest of the cast (including Macaulay's little brother Kieran Culkin) range from OK to good. Martin Short, however, is yet again a stand-out and is very funny - he wasn't necessary for the plot but he is funny and a good addition to the movie regardless. Overall I'd say this is one of those sequels that didn't need to be made, but could have been a lot worse. It's sweet, it's got some good lite-comedy moments, and in general it's just an enjoyable family movie that isn't trying to be anything other than simple entertainment -- which it is. Good, but first one was better; This film is good but you have to suspend disbelief quite a few times. All the performances are fine, with Steve Martin a scream again, and Diane Keaton glowing from start to finish (she has a lot more to do here than in FOTB1). The best scenes are: George trying to get buff in the gym, asking which famous men he's younger than, pointing to his wedding ring at the lady in the car next to him, and seeing all the misbehaving children out the window in his car while his wife sees all the happy kids and their parents out her window. And of course, when George holds his child and grandchild outside the delivery room. My favorite line: \"Now going to the movies will be economical: one child, two seniors, thanks!\" Good; This is well worth seeing. Everything goes perfectly. Ain't no such thing as too much Steve Martin, baby. Here Martin carries weak material, but it's a positive movie that shows the joy a new child brings. You will laugh, cry and cheer. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Some of the dialog is a bit lost on US audiences, but still some hilarious lines. The music is amazing throughout. Also the scenery is incredible. I saw the cast had a lot of great comedians, so I thought there would at least be a few laughs. Instead, I was surprised to see a very touching movie, absolutely great script. I give it 7 out of 10. What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the 1951 sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of 50. This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! The Best Movie of All Time; let me tell you.. anyone who does not like the movie is just a little close minded.. i read comments that thought the movie was too unrealistic but thats what makes it so great! i mean look at other movies such as lord of the rings or star wars neither or them contain true reality.. this is why its a movie. Anyway, i loved Steve martin in this movie. he does a magnificent job of playing the character for an over protective dramatic father. he was the best actor. who could have played the part of Nina as well as Diane Keaton. she makes the part of the mom annoyingly overwhelming mother, which is exactly what the point of us as the audience to think of her. martin short is the best of all \"fra'nk's\". the way he seeks George banks's approval is perfect. and lastly Kimberly Williams is the gorgeous daughter we are all expecting her to be.. i watch this movie every night before bed and i can recite every word to this movie. because of father of the bride II i have dreamed to meet Steve martin.. \"hes my hero!!\" hopefully you fall in love with it too. and dream to be pregnant with your mother as did Annie banks. My comments are going to be very positive.; Hi! I think that Father of the Bride Part 2 was a great film and very hilarious. I think that the mother and daughter could have been pregnant at the same time!  It was a great movie and I recommend it to all people who want a warm-your-heart comedy! It's a great film! Thanks! Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the 1951 movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the 1950 classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the 4 year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com I really found this film quite annoying; My basic opinion of this movie is that it is a crappy American feel good comedy. It is simply about a man who is going through another mid-life crisis as his daughter, who was married in the first movie, has a baby in this one. The catch is that his wife is also pregnant and with the irony really dripping, both of them have their babies within minutes of each other. As such the kid's auntie is exactly the same age as him (it won't happen to me, though it is possible). When I watch this movie I think to myself, this guy really doesn't have problems. There are people out there that have much more serious problems than he does. He admits to having a beautiful wife who loves him, owns his own home (or did), has a great job and great kids - and he thinks he has problems. Maybe the whole comedy is in the fact that he is worrying about absolutely nothing, but seriously, when I watch this movie, I simply shake my head and think that the guy is a loser. I really don't think it is all that funny. In fact, the guy has much more serious problems. He seems to be spending an awful lot of money, and is going to find himself in a huge amount of debt, and he doesn't seem to ever be at work. My question is not only where he gets his money, but where he gets the collateral for all of the purchases he is making. He buys back his house for an extra $100,000 on top of what he sold it for, and really, how can he seriously afford it. Okay, it wasn't all that bad. As a movie is was made well, and I did chuckle a few times. But in reality, this guy is a serious loser because he has more than anybody could possibly ask for, and he is worried about growing old. Hell, we all grow old, but he has experience more than what a lot of us have already had. Instead of worrying about growing old, the twit should look back on his life and be thankful for the blessings that God has already given him as opposed to forgetting all of that and winging about his age. like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $15k bonus to move out in 10 days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $100k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. Father of the Bride II; Likable, but not as impressive a follow up to the 1991 hit with Martin now dealing with his daughter being pregnant...And, oh yeah...his wife is pregnant again too. Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie. Touching even in its weak state.; Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, and kimberly Williams Paisley return in Father of the Bride Part 2. The film as a sequel was slightly disappointing, but on the whole, likeable. George and Nina Banks are in for the surprise of their lives when they find themselves middleaged and expecting their third child.  The timing is impeccable as Annie Banks-MAckenzie also realizes that she is expecting. Thus Steve MArtin embarks on a nine month journey that will consist of him building a new room for the baby, watching his daughter become a woman and overdosing on sleeping pills.  Honestly, the film made me laugh hysterically and i shed a few tears at the bittersweet ending. 3 and 1/2 stars out of five. not bad for a sequel; as sequels go,this is film isn't too bad.i didn't think ti was quite as good as the first one,but it's not a bad effort.i didn't find it as funny,and some of Steve Martin's histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me.really,this one doesn't quite have the same sincerity as the first.through much of this movie,i was all too aware i was watching a movie,whereas with firs tone,i was drawn in,and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting.having said that,there are some bright spots.for,one,this movie is just as touching as the first.and Eugene levy has a great cameo.and there is still some fun to be had.even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above,i still think Father of the Bride II is a 7/10 George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in 1995. It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. 2.5 out of 5 stars. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. I loved it, but one thing bothered me...; I enjoyed this movie: Diane Keaton is my favourite actress, Steve Martin always makes me laugh and Martin Short is great, but I felt really sorry for Keaton having to pretend to be pregnant. She didn't seem to be enjoying it and when the Banks were at the hospital, she actually looked rather bored, because whenever she spoke from the moment George protested about the doctor's name, she almost made it sound like she was in a maths lesson. Apart from that, it was great! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching Martin, Keaton or Short in a movie or who likes to laugh. 9/10 because of the little problem, but it was great. I loved it. Better than the original; This one is definitely better than the original, funnier, smoother pace, and in some places, better acting! Plus Martin Short has more screen time. Great! This is a great movie for anyone who like good clean comedy. Awesome! Five out of Five Moose Stars! Father of the Bride Part II; The first film was the remake of the original version starring Spencer Tracy and Dame Elizabeth Taylor, and it became very popular, so naturally they felt like a sequel was needed to continue the story. Basically George Banks (Golden Globe nominated Steve Martin) is getting used to the fact that his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) has become the bride now wife and got married to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), and more surprisingly a mother when she reveals she is pregnant. With this revelation comes out George has a small midlife crisis, and he tries to recapture his youth, including dying his hair, but he does eventually settle somewhat and get used to the idea that he will be a grandfather. But then he is shocked to find out he will be a father again as well when his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) reveals that she is also pregnant, and it may appear that both her and Annie's baby will be born on the same day. With these things happening, and the house having leaks and termites there is the opportunity to change things by selling the house to Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy), but he changes his mind later. When George manages to get the house back, despite a higher price, he gets the help of camp wedding planner/coordinator, now interior designer, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) to make the baby rooms and get things ready for the arrival of children. There are a couple of false alarms from Annie where she thinks the baby is coming, but eventually it comes to the real thing, and they rush to hospital, and of course Nina goes in to labour as well. In the end George is very happy to be holding both his new baby son and his new baby granddaughter is his arms, before his daughter and her husband move away to their own new home. Also starring Kieran Culkin as Matty Banks, B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein, Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie and Jane Adams as Dr. Megan Eisenberg. I can see what the critics mean by giving it two out of five stars in certain places, it certainly isn't as funny as the original film, it concentrates more on the sentimental material, but that's not a bad thing for this comedy drama. Okay! No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. AWESOME!; This movie is great!  I think it's one of the best movies ever made!  I love both Father of the Bride I and II!  I think that it is cute how they have the mother and daughter pregnant at the same time!  I hope that they come out with a Father of the Bride Part III, that would be awesome! :-) Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video Worthy second installment.; Mild SPOILERS are contained in the following comments. However, I believe everyone knows the story and how it turns out. The fun of the movie is seeing the actors, especially Martin. Steve Martin is back as George Banks, having just lost his daughter and basketball partner (Kimberly Williams as Annie ) to marriage, and now she is back home with her husband and a big announcement. She is pregnant. Of course everyone is happy, and the joy is doubled when Nina Banks (Diane Keaton as Annie's mom) finds out she is pregnant too. Poor George doesn't know if he can handle all this. After all, he is about to be a grandfather, he's not prepared to be a new father also. Martin Short is back as Franck Eggelhoffer, the unintelligible wedding planner. All ends well as both mom and daughter deliver their babies at the same time, in separate hospital rooms, so George has to go back and forth. The movie ends a few months later, and as Annie and her new baby are leaving, she gives dad a miniature basketball, a reminder to George that he can raise another basketball partner. Father of the Bride Part II; The 1991 Steve Martin comedy proved out to be popular enough to earn a sequel, much like the original Father of the Bride of 1950. All of the main cast of the first film returns in a story where the eponymous father George Banks (Martin) has gotten over the stressful wedding of his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) and her fiancé Bryan (George Newbern). However, when she breaks the big news about her pregnancy to the family, the grandpa-to-be becomes anxious about getting older and starts proving his youthfulness in various ways, such as selling the family's beloved house to a greedy real estate developer Habib (Eugene Levy). Life has more in store for George and his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) though, as it soon turns out that Annie's is not the only pregnancy in the family. Again, the humour is best when it relies on Steve Martin's comical talent and charisma instead of craziness and exaggeration. Unfortunately, adhering to the rule of always making sequels bigger and louder, the writers have given more screen time to the unbelievably annoying wedding planner Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) whose noisy and flamboyant scenes are certainly the weakest parts of the whole movie. The fussy bumbling caused by the impending childbirths at the end is also rather annoying and unimaginative. I think the movie works best during the more subtle scenes, such as Martin making uncomfortable faces while hiding his nervousness or arguing about the baby's surname with the overjoyed family during a dinner. Besides the run-of-the-mill jokes, the movie also shamelessly wallows in impenetrable sentimentalism of the newborns' adorability. Especially the music is so unbelievably schmaltzy that it was really getting on my nerves while watching; can't the filmmakers just trust their material's appeal without burying it under a sweety-tweety sugar mountain? Nevertheless, despite the predictability of the plot and the not-so-hilarious jokes, George Banks is a very likable character and Steve Martin is at home in the role, so those who enjoyed the first movie will probably like this one too  the basic building blocks of the story have not been changed at all. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. This is my favorite movie; ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is my favorite movie.  I think it is funny, sweet, and truly touches the heart.  In the sequel to the previous, Father of the Bride, George Banks (Steve Martin) is finally getting over the fact that his beloved daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams)has gotten married.  But then she shocks him with the news that she is pregnant.  Everyone else is thrilled, but George is not.  He believes that he is too young to be a grandfather.  He tries to become young, but doesn't succeed.  Then, both he and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton) are shocked to find out that Nina is also pregnant.  George now thinks he is too old to be a father.  They have one other child other then Annie, Matty (Kieren Culkin.)  Through the chaotic turns of pregnancy, George learns to except the fact that his daughter has grown up and moved on, even though it is hard.  They also have to deal with Fronk (Martin Short,) the goofy wedding coordinator from the first movie, who is now designing the new baby's room.  They then discover that Annie has been given the opportunity to design a museaum in Boston, far away from their own, San Marino, California.  George now realizes that he will miss his daughter more then ever, but he learns to get along.  In the end, he enjoys being a grandfather to baby George, and a father again, to Megan, named after the doctor who delievered her.  In this funny and heartwarming sequel, everyone puts out fantastic performences once again.  Even though I very much enjoy Father of the Bride, I enjoy this much more. And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW2, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. Loved it!!; I thought the sequel to the first Father of the Bride just showed what a great chemistry Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, George Newbern, and Kieran Culkin, along with all the other supporting actors have together. I would actually love to see a Father of the Bride Part III and I usually hate more and more sequels. I really do enjoy this sequel and I think it is better than the first one. I would reccommend any and everyone seeing this movie (but not without seeing the first one). Not bad...but could have been better; The first time I saw Father of the Bride 2 I really liked it.  I still enjoy watching some parts of it but I thought some realistic parts in the movie were not necessary.  First of all, the mother and daughter pregnant together.  This could happen but probably when the mother is not older than 40.  Nina had to be at least 47.  Is it likely that the mother would be pregnant at that age? I don't think so.  Secondly, I could not understand why George and Nina wanted the baby to have two last names.  Children always go by their father's last name and I thought Brian's father made a good observation when he said that George and Nina already had Matt to carry on the Banks name.  So why they thought the baby should have two last names is beyond me.  In conclusion, Father of the Bride 2 is still cute and fun to watch in some parts but I thought the first one was much better Heartwarming &amp; Hilarious; Steve Martin does it again in this touching and funny sequel to 1991's Father Of The Bride the rest of the cast returns in a new story dealing with the joys of parenthood. I loved Father Of The Bride II not only because it was funny, mostly it was due to the comic antics of a man dealing with two pregnancies at once. He's a great comedian as well as an on screen father, my favorite scene is when both babies arrive at the same time. A year has passed since George Banks (Martin) watched his only daughter Annie (Williams) get married and has accepted her transformation from daughter to wife. She comes home with her husband Brian (Newbern) to announce the wonderful news to her parents, brother Matty (Culkin) and in-laws that she's pregnant. Everyone is thrilled and excited except for George who thinks he's too young to be a grandpa, from then on he tries to act young by dying his hair and exercising. But things are about to get a little crazy when his loving wife Nina (Keaton)discovers she's pregnant too now George must deal with the impending arrival of both his grandchild and his own child. Thrown into the chaos is Franck Eggelhoffer (Short) the wedding coordinator who helps to design a room for the new addition to the Banks family. This movie is not only sweet but it's charming entertainment for fans of all ages. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. 5/10 A really likable comedy.; I enjoyed this film. I found that it was easy to relate to Steve Martin's character George Banks as a parent. The relationship between him and his daughter Annie, played by Kimberly Williams, was an honest father daughter relationship. I recommend this one for parents in general and empty nesters in particular. The idea of a mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time is plausible and amusing. A Well-Done Sequel!; A sequel to immensely likable Father of the Bride, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is A Well-Done Sequel! Its enjoyable as well as emotional! 'Father of the Bride Part II' Synopsis: George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. 'Father of the Bride Part II' is worthy sequel of a wonderful prequel. The characters still appeal, the humor works &amp; the emotional moments are heartfelt as well. Nancy Meyers &amp; Charles Shyer's Screenplay is genuinely well-done. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography &amp; Editing are fair. Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains. On the whole, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is a satisfying sequel. Some of Martin's best work!; First, this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2. If run back to back, they run like one beautiful story. This production is great from start to finish. Everything about it is wonderful, including the story, the acting performances and the direction. This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor. His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances. He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man. This movie is no exception. His performance is comedic, yet startlingly genuine. Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's. I love this movie. I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character; with how he feels, and what he's going through. This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum, and I love it. It's less about family, and more about life's curves; the every-day things that make us crazy, happy, sad, and ultimately stronger. It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think, consider, ponder the events which have led us to where we are now. Combined, they rate 8.6/10 from... the Fiend :. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late '40's)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... daughter gets married; In the sequel to Father of the Bride we have the daughter getting married and moving away from home, this presents a big dilemma to the father played of course by Steve Martin. Maybe not quite as funny as the first one,, or as good,, but definitely above average,, it's always a pleasure watching Steve Martin work at his craft. The movie is basically about how the family,, especially the parents deal with their young daughter growing up,, getting married, and eventually moving away from the nest.. the cameo from Eugene Levy is just wonderful,, as a real estate agent who is trying to sell the very home where our main character lives.. all in all a very family friendly movie,, that I would recommend. Not as good as the first, but good family fun; This movie is as thin as you can get. Its' emotions are easily played. There are no surprises. It is very predictable. And I say...so what? What is wrong with that? This is an American Dream movie. Everything goes perfectly and everyone is as happy as can be. Why should it be a complicated character study? It deals with the birth of babies. There's no complex feelings that need to be dealt with in this situation. A life is being created. A family is being blessed. A baby's birth is a time for love and hope. This movie has both in spades. It's a very positive movie that shows the joy a new baby brings. Every parent-to-be should watch it. A child's birth is an emotional event with no equal. This movie knows it and milks it for all its' worth. My only complaint is it should have been called Parents of the Bride. Way too much time is spent with the relationship between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. There should have been more attention paid to Kimberly Williams. Not only were the scenes between her and Martin the best scenes in this and the original, but Kimberly Williams is the most beautiful actress to come out of Hollywood in many years. Forget all the blond, silicone filled, bimbos that every teenage boy raves about. Ms. Williams is a natural beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****. Like Cliches?; ...That weren't even funny the first time? I've seen a lot of films with Steve Martin in them, and they all made me laugh.  Until this one. Part one is worth a look..it may make you laugh a couple of times (I think I laughed once).  But I recommend avoiding this one all together. Deja Vu; I found this sequel to be both charming and entertaining. What I learned tonight is that this movie is actually a remake of the 1951 movie \"Father's Little Dividend\", which in turn was the sequel to the original \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and with the same great cast: Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Bennett, et al.  They both share the same broad comedy and story line (only one pregnancy in the earlier version though), and in their own ways are equally entertaining.  Old or new incarnations, however, be sure to see parts one and two in sequence. Not exactly the most innovative of films, but still great fun!; This is an excellent, funny, warming film. Although a lot of the \"same kind of thing\" was done in the first movie, it's still entertaining. Steve Martin's character was good, although at times his behaviour is quite pathetic and Martin Short is again entertaining. (Particularly his pronunciation of the word 'pregnant).' Although it's highly predictable and not the most intellectually stimulating of films it is still well worth watching and the vast majority of people would enjoy this film. Not bad, but inferior to the first; I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the first movie. It was not without sentiment and it was hardly original, but it was still beautifully filmed, well acted, charming and funny. This sequel is not as good as the first I agree, but I still quite enjoyed it. The story is predictable, and there are some so-so parts in the script. Eugene Levy, who I do like by the way, is okay here but his character felt somewhat unnecessary and felt like he was there as an additional character and to give the film a longer length. And I also would have liked to have seen more of Kimberley Williams, she is so beautiful and quite a good actress, but I actually do agree that a little too much time is spent between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. However, it is beautifully filmed, has a nice soundtrack, decent pacing and good direction. And the acting is fine too, Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are still very likable, and while as I've said I would have liked to have seen more of her Kimberley Williams was lovely. And I loved Martin Short here too, he was one of the main merits of the first film, so to see him in his wonderfully fluffy turn again was a very nice surprise. Overall, not bad at all, could have been better, but I liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox A so so sequel; 'Father of the bride' was a good film and probably didn't need a sequel. But this is Hollywood, everything needs a sequel. While it is clear that a lot of effort has gone into making this sequel work, the central idea stretches credibility and every idea the writer had seems to have been thrown at the wall in a desperate attempt to get laughs. There are moments that remind you of the heart and humour that the preceding film had, but it's a load of nothing really. I went into this film dubious about how good it could be, and I didn't finish watching it any more convinced that the original needed a sequel. Pretty much just a rehash of the first; As this movie started, it reminded me a lot of the first. Various scenes were reenacted, only a little wackier, sort of like it was trying to be a shade more funny than the first; I guess that is the usual stuff for this type of sequels, but I think it failed at that. Apart from that, the movie pretty much succeeds in being a good sequel to the first. The story is also somewhat reminiscent of the first one. All the same actors return as well, and they are pretty much the same, just a shade more wacky. The story is also told by Steve Martins character, George Banks, like in the first. Pretty much everything in the movie is a takeoff of the first; this doesn't make it bad though, if you liked the first, liked the characters, you'll want to see this too, if nothing else, to see the characters again. It is about as funny and as sentimental as the first was, and as enjoyable. Fans of the first one, or of Steve Martin will most likely enjoy at least some part of it, as this is the typical for both the first movie and Steve Martin. 7/10 Better than the first one!; I love Steve Martin, but I was disappointed by the first movie, so I wasn't expecting as much from this one.  But to my surprise, this one was even better! It's constantly funny, just like one should expect from Steve Martin; it's not preoccupied with corny emotion, like the first movie was. It's Steve Martin in his best performance since \"My Blue Heaven.\" Sometimes sequels can be surprisingly good.  This one is better.  It has all the comedic elements that were stagnant in the first movie.  It's everything the first movie should have been, and more!</td>\n",

While the animation is groundbreaking to say the least, it doesn't mean that it has a story to back it up.  I for one love cartoon movies, but this left a sour taste in  my mouth.  Maybe it's because in what is supposed to be a kids' movie, we see one character trying to \"off\" another character, out of pure jealousy.  The other toys were just annoying as the chorus, as they, like the leads, had a total lack of any real character.  There were some bad attempts at humor that didn't even win a giggle out of me or my family. Skip it and see Shrek or Ice Age.  Better stories to balance the animation. An unmissable film; From our first sight of Woody until his happy face disappears off of the screen the makers of this film keep audiences worldwide glued to the screen with eager anticipation. The films unlikely scenario where talking toys battle to save a fellow toys life is amazingly gripping and a \"must see\" which will keep the whole family (yes even the teenageers) amused. The more mature audience will recognise the \"spoofy\"side to the movie. This is most noticeable when plastic soldiers (who mimic the actors in \"Who saves wins\") jump off  bannisters with miniature parachutes and talk to each through baby monitering systems.!!! In conclusion, TOY STORY is one of the most thought out films in the industry as props and scenerycan not just be found lying around and everything had to be individually designed, crafted and computerised To Infinity and Beyond!; It was May of 1991, and Disney were on the brink of the Animation Renaissance which would bring about a treasure-trove of beautifully drawn and designed 2D films. Only a few months later would the first and very elegant Beauty and The Beast be released. But behind the scenes, they negotiated a deal with a small animation studio named Pixar, previously only animating shorts to demonstrate the capabilities of their computers. John Lasseter would serve as director after being fired from Disney as he pitched the revolutionary idea of the first ever fully computer animated full length feature film. And so Toy Story was born. It was a long and complicated production process full of worries about budget, and the infamous Black Friday reveal which prompted a production shut-down and a full script revamp. It's sequel would later nearly undergo a disaster of similar scale. But after an arduous process Toy Story became a ground breaking film in animation history and set the first benchmark for 3D animation. Toy Story is a beautifully rendered film for its time and eye poppingly gorgeous. Pixar's revolutionary animation process created a living breathing world with every tiny detail lovingly crafted - blades of grass, hairs on head, scuffs on floorboards. The character movement is smooth and seamless, the use of light and shadow realistic. Being Pixar's first ever feature film and under close scrutiny from Disney executives and given a small budget, short cuts like ponytails and short hair were used, and the textures of the background and minor characters are less visually impressive, but Tory Story still holds up remarkably well decades later. It's all wrapped in a stirring score by Randy Newman which easily accompanies the film's movement; lifting for Buzz's first take-off, eerily tip-toeing at the Spaceport Arcade. The main song You've Got a Friend in Me is heartfelt at the start of the film but even more-so at the end, Newman duetting with Lyle Lovett to symbolise the new partnership of Buzz and Woody. The story is a simple but universal one, with an original twist. What happens when toys are alive, and furthermore, what happens when they are replaced by newer, cooler models? The titular characters of Buzz and Woody are stunningly brought to life through fantastic character design and voice-acting. Woody is your classic Western cowboy with a pull string that spouts recorded catchphrases while Buzz Lightyear is a futuristic Space Ranger who has pop-out wings and a laser. Who can compete with that? Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide a great deal of emotion and character through their respective portrayals; in particular Woody's charm and leadership is a thin veneer for his insecurity and ego which is displayed when Andy gets a newer toy. Terry Gilliam singles out a great shot at the height of Buzz's personality as a Space Ranger, where he discover he is actually just a toy, and where the camera zooms out and the big bravado he was only a moment earlier is now a tiny figure. But apart from them you have a whole cast of iconic characters each with their quirks, personalities and traits; Mr Potato Head, Re the dinosaur, Slinky Dog, Hamm the piggy bank, Bo Peep, the plastic toy soldiers...We get the sense that these toys have been in the Andy household forever, and have formed a tight knit family and well-oiled hierarchy. the sequel 4 years later gives them additional screen-time which comes with more laughs (including the addition of Mr Potato Head's wife). Toy Story set the first benchmark for computer animation and heralded a period of critical and box office success for Pixar. The 2 sequels are also crafted with as much detail and care as the first, but nothing can match the first gasps of wonder and amazement at the movement and freedom of the 3D world when it first hit cinemas in 1995. An affectionate love letter to toys and film; This was Pixar's first feature-length film, the first full-length computer-animated feature film and the first film in the Toy Story series. There will be spoilers ahead: I could just say that this is a phenomenal film, a ground-breaking film and a must watch if you love film in general and/or animation in particular and leave it at that, but this comment would be rather thin if I did so, so I'll do a bit more here. I don't really need to discuss the plot, because, chances are, if you're reading this, you've probably seen this already. I'll do a brief sketch: this concerns a boy named Andy and his toys. Lifeless when humans are around, the toys come to life when none are in the room. Woody is the leader of the toys, but his place is threatened by a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. Andy and family are preparing to move. Through a series of mishaps, Woody and Buzz wind up being lost and must make their way back before the family leaves or be separated from Andy forever. After a series of adventures, they make it back and get on board before the family is gone. That's a simple story. The parts of the film are each so excellently crafted that it takes a simple story and creates gold. The animation still holds up, even after 20 years, which is an eternity in computer animation. The script is marvelous and the writers clearly show that they possess a love for both toys and film. The toys showing up in here are a mix of new (Woody and Buzz) and classic (Mr. Potatohead, Etch-a-Sketch and green army soldiers). There are gags referencing films as diverse as Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Wizard of Oz. Pixar also references the various shorts they'd made up to that point and TV shows like Star Trek and The Simpsons. The voice casting is spot on. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen nailed their parts. Don Rickles and Jim Varney were inspired casting choices and John Ratzenberger began an association with Pixar which continues today. The score and songs by Randy Newman are perfect, particularly the song, \"You've Got a Friend In Me\", which goes to the heart of the film. It's just an exceptional film. The attention to detail is incredible. Even minor characters turn out to have a significant influence on things, like the mutant toys in Sid's bedroom (Sid and his dog Scud are the villains here, Sid being a rather twisted kid next door). The look of everything is astonishing, though it has aged in 20 years. This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray is is well worth getting. Most highly recommended. The first of it's kind.; Toy story is the first Pixar animated film. Toy story amazed everyone on earth back in 1995 and still does to this day. That amazes us and so does Pixar. Bringing us some of the best films of our time. Nowadays we have Up, Ratatouille, Wall E, Finding Nemo. The list goes on. But we should remember the first one. Toy story stars Tim Allen and Tom Hanks as Toys. Hanks plays Woody, a cowboy toy who is the most popular from his owner Andy. That all changes when Andy buys a toy called Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen) who is an astronaut. Woody becomes awfully jealous and tries everything in his power to get rid of Buzz. There are other plot points that I would rather not go into. Toy story creeps me out a little. The thing about it that creeps me out is the villain named Sid. Sid is this toy murderer who lives next door to Andy and the toy gang. There is a part in the end when all of the toys retaliate. That part scares me every time. Watching these destroyed toys retaliate. I never thought something like that could creep me out. I guess I get creeped too easily. The first Toy story is a work of art. It's got great visuals and will creep you out. Kind of like Robert Zemeckis' A Christmas carol, which is another work of art I think. As I have said in many reviews, Toy story is a film that you'll never forget. I haven't. My memory is crap. Toy story:****/**** The first one will be remembered the most; The movie isn't just the first one in the Toy Story series, but also the first movie Pixar ever created and they didn't waste any time showing us what they could do. This movie shows what being creative is all about. The soul ingredient of the story is simply what happens when your toys are left alone and the benefits (and downfalls) of being a toy. But what amazes me the most is the emotional connection that it gives to anyone at any age and what keeps it together is the friendship between toys, even though they are only toys, the movie easily grasps the emotions of 2 people turned into best friends. Of course sometime in the future another animated movie will have the same success or more than Toy Story and may even beat it. But Toy Story will always be remembered as the first, and never will be forgotten. Best Toy Story Movie; This movie is funny, hilarious, humorous1 It makes the whole wide world wanna laugh! This movie is so funny, you'd laugh your butt off! I liked it how Sid scared his sister but messing up her toys. I wish I can do what he does to the Animal Crossing players! They make me sick because they suck more than Justin Bieber. Also, it's funny how Woody murdered Buzz! Also Bo Peep reminds me of Princess Peach from the Super Mario series. She should have appeared in the other Toy Story movies. I can't believe they screwed up on Toy Story 3, one of the worst Toy Story movies ever! I hope they don't ever screw up Toy Story 4, which comes out next year. Wonderful animated feature...; TOY STORY is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. It goes along with TOY STORY 2, TARZAN, A BUG'S LIFE, THE LION KING and CHICKEN RUN as some of my favorite animated features. Tom Hank s voices Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll owned by a boy named Andy who is the most-played toy until a space ranger, Buzz (Tim Allen) comes along and Woody is not good friends with them. But one day later, a mean toy-hating man who owns a collection of mutant toys and tries to threaten Buzz, and it is up to Woody to save Buzz with the help of the mutants before it's too late to escape to Andy's new house. The sequel is better than the original, but TOY STORY is a good movie. **** What Makes a Toy a Toy?; Marvellously inventive, brilliantly rendered, perfectly paced, adorably characterized CGI gem with a sinister edge to its witty and intelligent storyline. The voice cast is a pleasure to behold and the toy figures are instantly likable. The alternation between action-packed moments, laugh-out-loud gags and scenes of emotional, downright existential crises offers a deeper viewing experience anyone could've hoped for. Despite two well-made sequels, this one's still the best installment of the much-loved franchise. 8 out of 10 freak toys Another Childhood Favorite!!!; I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since. It has a great storyline. Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, and many more. On Andy's Birthday, he receives a Buzz Lightyear action hero, and Woody becomes jealous because he isn't Andy's favorite anymore. When Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, his friends want nothing to do with him. On the way to Pizza Planet, Buzz confronts him in the family van, and knocks him outside and the family drive off without them. They go through a lot trying to get back to Andy before they move. When they end up in Sid's room, the kid who tortures toys, Woody and Buzz must work together in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TOY STORY!!! A pioneer; You may or may not like \"Toy Story\", but there's something that's perfectly clear: it changed for good the animation cinema. Pixar were pioneers not only in the world of 3D animation but also in offering products that might entertain children and adults. I do prefer movies such as \"Antz\" or \"Shrek\", but I think \"Toy story\" is so funny as well. Anyway, we can't avoid the \"Disney touch\" and all those awful songs... So, after \"Toy story\" came other movies that were much better, but this was the first one and it has a relevant position in the history of cinema. *My rate: 6/10 Really Sweet Movie!; Whether you're a fan of animated Disney movies or not, this movie is brilliant! It's great for family time movies or great for the everyday average Disney fan. The characters are put together very well. After I saw it, it made me actually think about throwing out old toys. I've been a fan of this movie ever since I was born(it was really big then) and I still watch it from time to time. I would definitely recommend this to anybody. Great fun for anyone; Toy Story is definitely a film that a kid should watch before they are a teen. Its adventure and great sense of humour is appealing to adult audiences as well, and the atmosphere is brilliant. This really is a Toy Story. The plot is indeed quite simple, and it would have to be for a classic family. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks)is a toy 'sheriff' doll, owned by a young boy called Andy. Woodys Toy life couldn't as Andy loves him a lot, but as Andy's birthday party arises tension fills the bedroom with each toy living in fear of being replaced. Everything goes well till the last birthday present is opened.. enter Buzz Lightyear! I would be criminal to tell you the rest of the story, but as far as humour and adventure are concerned, this film impresses in both categories. The toys different personalities really contrast and make you laugh, from the smart-chat of Mr. Potatoe head, to Slinky who is Woodys best toy friend. Its so easy to follow this film - the plot and characters are easy to watch the computer graphics are top notch. Compared to modern day CGI kids films, this stands out purely because of its innocence - a simple story, theirs no techno-babble, and its really fun. This truly is the film of the Nineties! The best film for big adults...; It's too bad the first user comment was that this is the best film for small children.  It's not just for kids!  My husband and I were 35 and childless when we first saw this.  We took a chance and purchased it before we saw it. After viewing it for the first time, we immediately watched it again.  It was if we had been on a really fun ride, and had to get back in line again. And fun is the operative word.  What a fun movie.  It's what I look for in a movie - something that takes you away from the cares of the world for a little while and makes you feel good.  Kind of like a drug without adverse after-affects. A catalyst in the field of computer animation; This was the first feature film that was done entirely by computers, and Pixar couldn't have done a better job. Not only is this movie hilarious, touching, and well plotted, but it lead the way for every other computer animated movie, and really set the bar high. If this movie had completely bombed there would no more, or at least not as many, CGI films and we would still be seeing drawn animation. Not to mention that the absolute perfect voice talents were cast to make such a memorable movie for kids and adults and teens and preteens and seniors and new borns or anybody else who eyes and hears or either or. This movie can not me avoided and is a cultural landmark that has opened the door for a completely new genre of movie making. My favorite film as a kid and remains a classic today; As a kid, I remember watching the first two Toy Story films frequently and collecting all the characters from the movie. I found out that it was the very first computer-animated film about two years ago and assumed that's why the movie is still so popular. Woody and Buzz are what made the film what it was then and today and were my favorite characters. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is where Woody and Buzz are launched in the air from the rocket and Buzz frees himself to fly into Andy's toy box. The film remains a classic and always will be to me. I also cannot wait for the third movie to come out June 18, 2010 because I'll be the first in line. Toy Story is the greatest Disney movie ever in my opinion! Looking forward to Toy Story 3 in two years!; There is absolutely no question about it, Disney/Pixar's 1995 hit film, Toy Story, is their absolutely best film in my opinion. Pixar, the visual effects studio based in Northern California, was best known for making short films with three dimensional technology, including some Oscar winning shorts. In 1992 a script called Toy Story was completed and Pixar decided to take on the challenge of creating the world's first fully computer animated motion picture. In 1995, that script came to life, and the rest is history. Not only was Toy Story a gigantic hit for Disney and Pixar, it started series of films that continues to amaze and bewilder children and adults of all ages. The animation was state of the art, and continues to look amazing to this day. The characters, Woody, and Buzz Lightyear, to the humor were all amazing. Pixar won a special Oscar for making the first computer animated film, and it led to many more films of it's type to this day. Pixar, don't make us wait, please give millions of children around the world what we desperately need, more adventures of Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Here's to many more Toy Story films in the future, including the upcoming Toy Story 3 coming in three years, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen returning as Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Why the trailer, why?; I remember seeing all the trailers for this movie and thinking, \"Uggh, how stupid.  Why do they make movies like this?\"  This was when I was in my macho mood.  Ya know, I've outgrown all this animated c%^p.  That was my attitude, so, of course, I avoided this movie for 4 years.  Just last year, Pokemon kinda broke me out of my \"macho mode\" and brought me back to those simple pleasures.  Taught me not to hide the child in me.  So, my mom says we're taking care of my little cousin and wants to know if there's a movie out that we could see.  I mentioned Toy Story 2 (he and I already saw Pokemon, the most underrated movie of '99), but hadn't seen the first one.  So, I drove over to his house to watch Toy Story.  Man, what I was missing.  This is a terrific movie, but not because of the great animation.  The animation is cool, but like I've said, don't be that superficial that you judge the movies completely on animation.  It's the characters that matter, and this one had great characters.  Something that everyone must see. The Best Kids Movie of the 90's; Despite being the first full-length computer-animated movie, the movie's strengths are its plot and characterization.  The technology is not thrust in your face and simply serves to support a truly excellent animated film. A classic. Cool A MUST see; I saw this movie when i was 5 years old a long time ago and I was so obsessed with Buzz Lightyear! I had toys of buzz Lightyear and carried them around anywhere i went.I saw this movie yesterday again and it was fabulous! plain fabulous. The story was amazing and the characters were well made! Nice job Pixar, You done it again! Tom Hanks did well doing a voice of Woody and same with Tim Allen with Buzz. I didn't really like Wall.E i almost fell asleep but this movie kept me awake the whole time with excitement! I recommend this movie to anyone no matter what age you are because this movie Just Beautiful! An fantastic awesome 10/10 very good songs; this has some of my favourite songs ever to be used for an animated film: Strange Things and You've Got a Friend in Need. the songs makes this now dated(!) film more original than Toy Story 2. The animation is fantastic and cutting-edge at the time. Also, it's only 6 years old now, the animation is still as impressive as it was back all those year ago. What else can I say. But this is 1990s equivalent to Snow White and the 7 dwarfs and,indeed, a lot better! Absolutely Love Toy Story!; Toy Story is an incredibly creative, fun film with a touching, heartfelt story. It is an awesome family film. The characters were brilliantly personified as they worked their way through their amazing adventures. The brilliant creativity of the characters and background layout is evident throughout the entire film; the background layout and lighting is fantastic. Each character has it's own vivid personality that was expressed with such unique individualism, additionally each character makes the viewer care for them. The story's continuity is definitely balanced with the awesome visual effects. The movie keeps the viewers' attention throughout it's entirety, with the twists, turns and suspenseful predicaments. The film also lends fun filled moments with many jokes/funny lines and expressions from the characters, while simultaneously allowing the viewers' hearts to reach out to the characters as they are tangled in many of the zany situations they encounter.

It's a very cute movie, mainly for kids, but it has a few chuckles thrown in for adults. The human characters in the movie didn't seem very realistic; their happy-go-lucky, suburban lifestyle just made them very flat and barely likable, especially if you grew up in a family unable to afford multiple toys. The voice actors were delightful, and their moods were directed very well, even for the plastic Army-men who don't show much emotion. The \"cannibal toys\" were very imaginative and creepy, so they served their purpose well. I thought the idea of the claw machine that housed the little green aliens was cute, how \"The Claw\" was their Messiah of sorts. The coloring in the film was vivid and incorporated some awesome day-glow tones that I had forgotten about over time. The ultimate reason to watch the movie is to witness Pixar's astounding use of 3D imagery, especially when they incorporate real-life effects onto the screen (i.e. The magnifying lens over Woody's face). There were some aspects of the film I didn't care for. The movie is only 77 minutes long without the prefaced, short 3D movie before it, making the story suffer and seem a little lacking. I found the music to be over-the-top schmaltzy and generic, but it is primarily for kids and the Disney crowd, so I guess it belongs here. Again, the character of Andy isn't very likable, other than the fact that he owns a lot of older toys that we made have seen commercials of as a kid. The story wasn't very mind-blowing, but from the vantage point of a toy on the run, it is imaginative enough. It's the typical Indiana Jones setting where the main characters always find a way to turn their two-steps forward into one-step back. The ending with the falling through the sunroof was very convenient and could've easily been the start of another obstacle they needed to face, for example. In the end, I like the movie for its presentation, but as a film, I was not blown away with originality or anything by its story. The messages that it sends about jealousy, envy, depression, fear, and questions about one's worthiness to another are the primary focuses throughout the movie, but it ends up just being another nicely tied-up package in the end, which is Disney for you. 5 stars. Created a decade ago, but still stunning; I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago. The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their \"leader\" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other... When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10. very funny; a great movie to watch with your children. this is a movie the whole family will enjoy. we watch this movie over and over. our thirteen year old likes it as much as my three year old, i like it just as much as they do. Tears....; Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library. \"I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films.\"; Toy Story  5/5 stars Children play with toys. It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc\n",
       " But what if toys were real? What if they could talk? Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, 'Toy Story,' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks). Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy's birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one? I'll give you a hint: 'Cheers'). But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid's house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy's house safely. 'Toy Story' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in 'Toy Story,' filling our minds with endless possibilities. What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn't just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar managed to preach to us 'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film 'Toy Story.' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real? What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities? An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you've got yourself one of the best films ever. Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll's expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good. The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy). The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing. I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had. Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made  something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.' 'Toy Story' 1 & 2 are both on my 'favorite films' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would 'Monsters Inc.' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar's upcoming film 'Finding Nemo,' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films  not sequels  by 2005), they should definitely try to make a 'Toy Story 3.' I'll be first in line for it, anyway. Cute Family Movie; Toy Story is a great movie for children and adults. Children will enjoy it simply because it is a cartoon. They will find it exciting because it shows toys coming to life which is something every child pretends with their toys. It's a good movie for children because it teaches them about jealousy, friendship, and teamwork. Adults will appreciate the animation and the accuracy of the details in the toys. Most of the toys used in this film were ones most people had as children. Such as, Mr. Potato head, the slinky dog, etch-a-sketch, and the army men. The theme of Toy Story is friendship. The movies theme song was titled \"You've Got a Friend in Me\". The friendship in this movie is about overlooking insecurities and finding a true friend in someone that you think would be your biggest enemy. A 2001 movie called Monsters Inc. is directed around this same theme. A little girl named Boo should be afraid of the monsters as much as the monsters are afraid of her but they form a friendship that overcomes their differences. Toy Story is about the lives of toys owned by a boy named Andy. Andy is having a birthday and he gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear. Andy's toys worry about him getting new toys because they are afraid they will get lost or donated. With the arrival of Buzz, Woody fills that Andy will like Buzz better. He tries to lose Buzz but instead he accidentally knocks him out of a window. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were brilliantly matched for being the voices of Woody and Buzz Lightyear. The personalities of the actors and characters seemed to be a perfect fit. The other toys in the movie, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky dog (Jim Varney), Pig named Ham(John Ratzenberger), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), and Bo Peep(Annie Potts), feel like Woody did this on purpose because he was jealous of the attention Buzz was getting from Andy. In order to make things right Woody realizes he needs to get Buzz back. Woody and Buzz both wind up separated from Andy and this is where their adventure begins. From this point on they work together to get back to Andy's before his family moves. Along the way Buzz realizes that he is not a space ranger but a toy. Woody tries to help Buzz understand that he is not just a toy and that he is very important to children. Woody convinces Buzz that they must get back to Andy. At the conclusion of the movie, Buzz and Woody are helping each other make it on the moving truck. They finally make it next to Andy who is excited to see both of them. Toy Story is about the friendship that is formed between Woody and Buzz. Once Woody was able to get passed his insecurities he realized that Andy could have two favorite toys. The motif of friendship is displayed throughout the movie by the relationships between Woody and Andy, Woody and all the other toys, and between Woody and Buzz. They also form a friendship with the strange toys at Sid's house. This movie is a true example of friendship. A Monumental Achievement in the Cinema; \"Toy Story\" is a real sight to behold because it is the first feature-length, computer-animated film.  Once you get passed the amazing visual effects, you see a really great film that works because of interesting characters and a second-to-none screenplay.  Even the roughest of critics would have trouble finding problems with this winner.  5 stars out of 5. Revolutionary. A fierce work of genius.; I don't necessarily like G-rated movies, but I make this one an exception. This movie is just great (it was the biggest moneymaker of 1995, and rightly so). I think that \"Toy Story\" appeals to kids and adults alike 'cause it's so funny, fast, and exhilarating. No one had done anything like this before; it was such a huge earthquake in the movie industry. It was also the world's first completely CG-animated movie. I can especially identify with Rex 'cause we're both nervous at times (except it's not from an inferiority complex), and we both like video games. This is easily one of my most favorite movies. \"An instant classic for all ages\". Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie; I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about. Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys. The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys. Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film. What a movie; Wow, I remember back in 1995 when I first saw this movie back in 1995. I think it was the movie being the farthest away that I could remember in theaters, and I saw it like two or three times. At first, I thought it was something about these toys trying to get to another group of toys, and they were a big group themselves. I couldn't believe how amazing the plot was. After I saw that movie it was like I couldn't get enough of Toy Story stuff. The characters were cool as well, and they just all seemed to be in the right places at the right time, like Mr. Potato Head, especially. And I had waited for years for a Toy Story 2 to come out, and after four years of waiting, it finally happened! And it was an excellent sequel! The extra fun in this movie, spotting the other toys that make cameos. It was kind of a simple plot that just worked, what with the rivalry between Woody and Buzz competing for Andy's favorite toy and the wisecracks of that pig, and Rex. I even got my own TS toys and such. It was truly a memorable movie. 10/10. Nice work, Disney and Pixar! Classic Pixar! This is what future Pixar films should be like!; Remember the original Pixar movies? Remember when Pixar didn't have stereotypical surfers and rappers? It was when the characters were fun and familiar. They didn't waste out time with farting jokes, but instead had smart jokes that weren't overdone. (even if they were more geared towards adults.) Luckily, we still have one good, classic Pixar movie; Toy Story. Peter Doctor knows how to make a fun and enjoyable family movie. Woody, is the \"top toy\" of Andy's bedroom. He leads meeting and events, and is one of the most popular toys there. But, then, Andy has a birthday party. Everybody is worried about getting replaced by a toy, but Woody assures them that there is nothing to be worried about. Funny, how he ends up getting replaced by Buzz Lightyear-the new popular toy. Ironic, huh? So, he gets jealous and tries to kill Buzz, by setting up a trap and pushing him out the window. Then, the other toys find out, and think \"Let's kill Woody!\" Wow, the irony in it all! The only way the toys will forgive him, is if he brings Buzz back. So, Woody and Buzz meet up at \"Pizza Palace.\" After exploring a bit, they get caught by Sid-the sick and twisted kid next door. But, what makes this movie so good? Toy Story isn't your average kids' film. It seems to have a message in it all. Two unlikely friends, Buzz and Woody hate each other at first. Then, they slowly learn trust each other, and stick together through thick and thin. Toy Story is perhaps one of those \"feel good\" movies. It's fun, and doesn't try to be anything it's not. Toy Story is an enjoyable, fun, and all-around excellent film. Be sure to put it on your \"To Watch\" list. 10/10 1995: Oh my God, is this real? 2016: Oh my God, what am I looking at?; Toy Story, as the first completely CGI animated movie, is still timeless in plenty of ways and is enjoyed by anyone who can say they like animation. I am one of them. The animation is of course crude by today's standards, but it was made in a way that makes it seem like 1995 wasn't that long ago. As dated as it looks, we can still appreciate it for being more than just a test of what computers could render. As for complaints, the jokes could have been funnier and the story could have less instances of convenience, like how Buzz and Woody enter the Pizza Planet Truck and come across a nice, high pile of pizza boxes to hide behind. There were also some errors in the anatomy of some toys, like RC. I won't take points off for the animation because hey, it was 1995 and Pixar had up to that point only been making shorts for 11 years, so it isn't something to grouch over (even though there were some superficial glitches like disappearing lights between scenes). All I can say is, see it soon and brace for a higher intrigue of the early history of CGI. Instant Classic; Every company has that one movie that puts them on the map. That is what Toy Story did for Pixar. Toy Story is a cartoon about a little boy's toy collection that is alive when the little boy is not around. His name is Andy and he loves his toys, and they love him back. Woody is a cowboy and is Andy's favorite toy. The toys always get worried every Christmas and birthday because they fear they will be replaced by a bigger and better toy. The story starts off with Andy's birthday party and all of the toys are on edge. It turns out that a new toy by the name of Buzz Lightyear challenges Woody as the favorite toy. Buzz comes along, steals a little bit of the spotlight and Woody gets incredibly jealous. Eventually Woody and Buzz get lost and must find their way home and back to Andy before he and his family move away forever. Let's start with the toys. I loved these toys. Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Little Bow Peep, Woody, Buzz, Slink, Ham, and even Etch-a-Sketch are the main toys and each are lovable and different. Rex is hilarious because he is ironic. He is a dinosaur but he is a wimp, and he is my favorite of the toys. I remember watching as a little kid and I was always excited to see Rex on screen. Each character has their individual role. There are also toys every kid can relate with and that make the movie special. For example, the barrel of monkeys, the small soldiers, the etch-a-sketch, and Mr. Potato Head are toys every kid used to play with. The smaller toys aren't really relevant for long but when they are seen in the beginning and end of the movie their impact is huge. One of the major themes in the story is jealousy and the relationship between Woody and Buzz. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the favorite toy. Woody is a cowboy with a pull string that says some catch phrases. The other toys look up to him, he is a hero, and Andy loved him with all his heart. Andy dresses up like a cowboy, has Woody posters, and is obsessed with this toy. Woody embraces the love; it defines him, gives him confidence, and confirms that he is the leader. Then Buzz Lightyear comes into the picture with his better quality of a toy. He doesn't have a pull string, but a button Andy presses to have a better sound quality voice box will speak catch phrases. He is made of plastic, which is more durable and he has wings pop out which can simulate flight. Woody becomes incredibly jealous of Buzz and fights for Andy's love. He eventually knocks him out the window. Toy Story may be a kid's movie but it has an interesting and entertaining premise, especially with its characterization. Woody and Buzz both develop into better and stronger characters. Woody goes from a pompous, jealous, selfish, toy, into a respectable and lovable character. He and Buzz become best friends and inseparable, a little cliché, but it's a movie for families so it's perfect. When Buzz first appeared he thought he was a real \"space ranger.\" He was convinced that he was not a toy, he could really fly, and he had a dangerous \"laser\" which was really a blinking light bulb. He develops and he eventually accepts the fact that he is a toy but he is a \"cool toy.\" He is \"Andy's toy.\" Woody admits his jealousy to Buzz and that becomes a turning point in their relationship. We have our villain in the movie, Sid. This kid is just evil. He is a spoiled kid who \"terrorizes toys, just for fun.\" One scene we the toys in Andy's room watch him as he straps firecrackers to a Commander Carl and it explodes. First of all, what kind of nine or ten year old kid plays with explosives? If he isn't nine or ten, what is he doing playing with kid toys? He may tear them apart and put different parts on them, making them scary and horrific for children to even see on screen, that just doesn't make sense. His character fits for a children's movie but in reality a kid like this would never exist in real life. Sid is really my only problem with the movie, but still a character needed for the film. Overall, Toy Story is a classic and put Pixar on the map and was the beginning of a highly successful company. It came out in the 1995 and families everywhere fell in love, including me. It is a movie that can be watched again and again no matter what age. It is a movie kids will show their children when they are older. Teenagers lined up to see Toy Story 3 years later because it meant so much to them back when they were little. Toy Story and its characters left a rare imprint on the hearts of people all over the world. Without a doubt, Toy Story gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and goes down as one of my personal all time favorite animation movies. Review; Disney and Pixar team up to create Disney's first full-length computer animated cinematic masterpiece, Toy story. Made in 1995, Toy Story was a marking point in movie history not only for its computer animation, but also having a timeless story full of witty characters and adventures. Toy Story is set in a suburban like neighborhood following an ensemble group of toys. Toys have human like abilities and personalities, but are forced to hide them from their human companions for the sake of being a toy. The main group of toys include a cowboy action figure, a piggy bank, a plastic dinosaur, a Mr. Potato Head as well as many more, all of whom live under their owner, Andy. The movie opens with Andy's birthday, which means receiving new toys to accompany old ones. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, is Andy's favorite action figure and also the group's leader. Woody and his fellow toy friends are somewhat threatened but also enthralled by this event. After a short time of announcing what Andy received, the toys are relieved to find that Andy did not receive any new toys. They were in for a surprise. Little did they know that there was a surprise toy on Andy's bed. It was the newest and coolest toy on the market, Buzz Light-year, a space orientated action figure voiced by Tim Allen who turns out to be Andy's next favorite toy. The strange thing about Buzz is that he believes that he is an actual space alien fighter. The toys try to convince Buzz that he is a mere toy only to be favored by Andy. Since Buzz believes he is actually a space fighter this leads into leaving the house and begin his journey to outer space. This ultimately pursues Woody to go and save his rival while getting tied up in a wacky adventure. There is a reason why this film acquired nineteen awards and ten nominations. Both adults and children will be entertained with the concept of living toys. The plot of the movie is really where it shines. There isn't one point in Toy Story where the plot gets boring or dragged out. People at Disney's Pixar developed the characters so well that it makes you understand how characters behave. Also, with a movie with so many diverse characters the audience is bound to find someone relate to. The only downside about seeing this movie is its length. It is around eighty minutes but it seems like the movie is about two hours, but that doesn't mean it isn't a full price movie because it is absolutely worth your time. Toy Story is definitely recommended to all families and especially kids. As for everyone else as an audience, I would recommend the movie if you would like to revisit your child hood or if you just want to see a beautifully animated movie. Whoever the audience may be, Toy Story will put a smile on your face. Toy Story is a classic beyond all means. It has stunning visuals, a crazy plot, deep character development, and most importantly it brings people back to a time when nothing mattered except toys. The most inspiring aspect of the movie is the moral of friendship. It really teaches people that they can't get anywhere in life without companionship. Toy Story also really captured the thought of \"what if toys were alive\" and executed it in a witty way. This movie will definitely be playing on family TV screens till \"Infinity and Beyond\"! Great fun for everyone; I just watched this movie for the first time since I was 12 (I'm 24 now). A lot of times when I view films I liked as a child, my perspective as an adult changes, by either noticing how little effort was put into certain films, or just that storyline/quality isn't there. Toy Story does not do this. As the first fully CG film, the detail I must say is fantastic and quite smooth. There is subtle adult humor in there that no child will be able to pick up, which makes this a great family flick, since both adults and children can enjoy it. The plot is original and quite interesting. And too anybody who ever lost a \"Toy\" as a child, sometimes you may wonder, if they got up on their own and walked away. It's sad that now and days, family films/kids films don't focus as much on story and dilogue like they used too and things just become a jumbled mess or completely juvenile. This film has quality story, dilogue and voice acting. And unlike a lot of other Disney movies which portray violence and some direct indendendo, this takes a lighter comedic side and it's a refreshing change from some films prior to it and even things made till this day. With that it also displays human emotions (Exaggerated of course for what they toys are feeling) But none the less, displays the essence of feeling replaced, or trying to be something you want to be,without having the means to do so. I highly reccemmend this to anybody who hasn't seen it yet. If you're and adult, don't be turned off by the CG animation. It's not by any means like a cartoon. The best film for small children....; My toddler has been watching this film for about 3 months, and I'm not sick of it and neither is she. It doesn't scare her, and it's teaching her about imagination, friendship, and kindness. All the performances are top notch, and the script is phenomenal. Any movie that has \"Wind the Frog!\" as a line , has to be a classic. The virtual world that has been created is remarkable in itself, but is equally partnered with a wonderful script. The song's compliment and impart in-depth character and plot points and Woody's personal journey is a lesson for all. I never really thought this was the best movie...; Toy Story is a good movie. It has good characters and a decent story. But is it really worth the hype? Yes, it's the first fully computer animated movie ever made and that's very impressive. For that reason alone, it will stand out in history. But I certainly never really thought it was the brilliant classic everyone else thought it was. Its animation is great but the story suffers from major pacing issues. There are entire moments of the movie right in the middle that bore me every time and don't stop boring me until I get to the film's climax, when it picks up again. A lot of trimming should have been done in the middle. Toy Story is good but its sequels are a lot better. So is it bad? No. But it's not brilliant. If this were 2-D, I doubt it would receive this high praise. Best Pixar movie to date!; Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (\"I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout\"). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox. this movie is awesome!the humor never bores!; i remember when this movie came out in 1995. i was seven at the time. i have loved it since day 1. actors such as tom hanks and tim allen bring sparkle to the show. they are both hillarious as woody and buzz. this movie is directed at both kids and adults. the humor never goes flat and it is never cheesy or corny. if you are a fan of tom hanks and tim allen or you just want a good laugh, than you shoud definitely watch this movie. you will not regret it. ********** out of **********. Loved It 10 Stars! Great Disney Movie!; Im 14 Years Old And I Saw Toy Story When I Was 10 Years Old I Loved It And I Still Do Today! Toy Story Is About Buzz And Woody And The Rest Of The Toy Gang Trying To Save Buzz From The Evil Sid! Very Good Movie! With The Voices Of Tim Allan (Home Inprovment) Tom Hanks (Forest Gump) And Don Rickles (Classc Tv Star) And Jim Varney (Ernest) -Jeremy One of the very best animation movies; TOY STORY stands on totally own feet! Having the sequel released after this, the TOY STORY became quickly a high status animation movie. In this first movie we get to know Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Potato Head and all the others, and I tell you; it's so jolly good entertainment! Seeing things from a toys perspective, is really fascinating and really cool, having stairs as a huge mountain and a aggressive dog is the Devil itself! TOY STORY starts off very wity, and although the movie gets darker and more exciting, it always has this extremely charming and wity undertone. I laughed jolly loud, and it is such a pro made movie that it's already a classic. STARS; 5/5 I seen a movie quite like this one; I saw this movie was I was about 10 years old and I was captivated. This film was awesome. I watch it over and over again with my younger siblings and I enjoy it just as much as them. It's a great story and every time I watch it, it brings out the the kid in me. Tom Hanks was amazing as Woody. Tom Hanks is one of my heroes and he never seizes to amaze me. He really brings Woody to life and he fits the role perfectly. Toy Story has a really good, solid story line and amazing visuals, especially for 1995. Toy Story 2 was almost as amazing as this movie, but nothing's as good as the original. I heard that they're making a Toy Story 3 set to be released in 2008. I'm hoping the theater is packed, with different generations, appreciating how Toy Story is not a only a stunning film, but also an example of the best kind of art there is. An absolutely awesome motion picture. 100/10 Exciting; Toy story is a 1995 American computer-animated adventure buddy comedy film produced by Pixar Animetion Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures, directed by John Lasseter at his directorial debut. Toy story was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first theatrical film produced by Pixar. In the film, toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present. A group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy, are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother and his sister are preparing to move the following week. The toy's leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Woody organized the other toys. Andy gets an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear as a birthday present. He believes that he is an actual space ranger. What happen to Andy's toys next? The characters have individuality. The picture on the screen is colorful, so I think the film is very cute. I am excited because I think about what happen next and what Andy's toy do next. I love the film's view of the world. Everyone enjoys the film, regardless of age or sex. I want you to watch the film. Pixar's first full length movie.; This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back 10 years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies. Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only 7 when I first watched it in theaters). The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like \"Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc.\" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him. Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a \"Buzz Lightyear\" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys. Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more. I give it an 8/10 perfect movie for the whole family to watch. Four Dimensional Toybox; I see that my previous comment on this film was deleted. This is the thing that started it all: Pixar. Somewhat photorealistic modeling. Deep, deep attention to story dynamics. An animated feature not so polished since \"Snow White.\" Something worthy. Something that led to the reinvention of Disney. Its an iconic turning point, like \"Citizen Kane,\" \"2001,\" \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" Greenaway's \"Tempest.\" (and others) Many things after change. So it should be seen on its historical basis alone. Here already you can see that Pixar decides to combine goals. They want the movie to be just as good as the best non- animated movie. There is the well-documented attention to refining and refining the story dynamics so that the narrative spine simply works. That took years. What I mean by combined goals is that they also realized that they were presenting something relatively new in their three D modeling capability. So they wanted to have that new cinematic vocabulary enhance the narrative dynamics and vice versa. It is subtle here, not fully developed until \"Nemo.\" But its plain to see when pointed out: the camera simply moves in ways that a real one does not. There are a broader set of intimate and distanced observer perspectives. These are not overused, lest you notice them, but you can see that out tolerance and viewing skill has slowly evolved from this to the later Pixar projects. (At this writing, that is \"Wall-E.\") The business about family and desired roles are not \"the point\" as some would say, but strategies to explore this deeper narrative power. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching. Great Animation, Great Characters; This movie probably was the best kids' movie I've ever seen in my life. Its animation was superb and Tim Allen was very funny as the voice of Buzz Lightyear, an action figure who really thinks he is the space hero he's supposed to be. The rest of the characters also had great things to say. \"That's not flying, that's falling with style!\" was an unforgettable line. It was a great movie.; This was, and still is, a great movie. It was amazing how the toys sort of live a double life, behaving like humans when no one's looking. I loved how all the toys are like a big family, with Woody being like a leader. As for Buzz Lightyear, I thought he was going to be really tall, but it turns out, he's shorter than he appeared. It was hilarious how Buzz believed he was a \"space ranger\". Also, Woody and Buzz sort of reminded me of Tawni and Sonny from the show Sonny With a Chance when they first met. Both Buzz and Sonny were \"the new kid\" who got accepted by almost everyone, and both Woody and Tawni were the only one who didn't accept the \"new kid\" and got jealous (but eventually learned to accept the \"new kid\"). So now, when I watch this movie, I think of the first episode of Sonny With a Chance. Best of the pixar movies; I am a big fan of all of Pixars movies and have seen all of them at the cinema, however for me this stands head and shoulders above the rest (including this years brilliant WallE). I watched it again recently and despite my age was pissing myself with laughter. This is mainly down to the characters who are so fresh. The banter between woody and Buzz is terrific (\"YOU ARE A TOY!!!\") and the other characters are also brilliant, especially ,for me, the bitter, angry and cynical Mr potato head , who lends a slightly darker more adult edge to this film compared to the Pixar movies to come ,as well as Sid his dog and the mutilated toys he has created. It is after all the only pixar movie rated parental guidance, i think which lets the emotions of the characters be more human in the shape of jealousy, pride and competitiveness. The central ideas of toys being alive when you cant see them is probably their best idea to date just in sheer amount of imagination and the amount of opportunity and possibility it creates (their is after all a sequel) and does kind of become a template for later. This definitely provided a lifeline for Disney who had seriously passed its golden age, and were starting to lose their reputation of quality and connection with its younger and older audience. With Lasseter moving to head of creative output at Disney, hopefully he will put them back on track also. (By the way I noticed a lack of any fathers in it, I don't know if thats meant to be read into) Fantastically Enjoyable Classic; Toy Story is about an old cowboy doll's jealousy toward a new spaceman toy, and the trouble it gets them into. The movie is a joy to watch, with a witty script jam-packed with hilarious gags and funny lines, wrapped up in an engaging, adventure-type plot. It's filled with appealing characters, voiced by an extraordinary cast. Tom Hanks as the cowboy and Tim Allen as the spaceman fit their roles perfectly, backed up by the amusing support of R. Lee Ermy, Jim Varney, and John Ratzenberger. The story does rely too much on coincidences (getting picked up by the next-door neighbor) and stereotypes (surfer-talking, reckless teenage pizza delivery guy), though. Contains: A Mild Comic Fight, Some Scary Images Toys come to life in this entertaining computer-animated film from Pixar...; It's only now, fifteen years after its release, that I decided to give TOY STORY a look on my large flat screen TV. I've never been a fan of computer animation per se, but this charming story has heart and wit and enough entertainment value for both young and old. The toy characters are both appealing and very funny in ways that anyone can appreciate, thanks to a clever script. Woody the Cowboy and Buzz Lightyear compete for the affections of a small boy, Andy, whose playroom is loaded with toys that come alive whenever anyone leaves the bedroom. Out of this fresh idea, the plot bounces along with supreme confidence as it races forward putting all of them in constant danger from their ever changing environment, especially when they leave the confines of Andy's home. Technically, the film is a marvel--everything simulated through computer wizardry, all of it invented with taste for artistry evident in every frame of the film--the kind of artistry that the Walt Disney studio demonstrated during the heyday of their cartoon wizardry. The brilliant colors look even more amazing in the good print of the film that aired on cable tonight. Well worth watching for pure family entertainment, a rarity nowadays. Pixar First Feature is an Instant Classic; Pixar's long line of success began in 1993 with TOY STORY, the first in a series of highly successful CG family films. Pixar had the formula nailed from the start, creating a fun kid's film with a powerful story capable of entertaining adults. In the film, we're introduced to the world of Andy's room when no one's around and the toys come to life. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is a classic cowboy doll complete with a pull-string vocal box and reigns as young Andy's favorite toy. For his birthday, Andy receives a flashy new Buzz Lightyear action figure (voiced by Tim Allen) and Woody must cope with the fact that he may have been bumped from the top position. A botched attempt at lodging Buzz behind Andy's desk throws Buzz out into the real world and Woody must bring him back to regain the trust of the other toys. The fun of this kid's film lies in the characters. Allen is hilarious as Buzz and his inability to grasp that he's merely a child's toy and not an actual space ranger, spending half the film trying to return to Star Command; Hanks is a bit neurotic and totally high strung as Woody in his role as the toy-in-charge (going so far as to hold meetings on plastic erosion and establishing a buddy-system for moving day). The room is loaded with great supporting characters in the form of classic playthings from everyone's childhoods: a Slinky dog, a Mr. Potato Head, a piggy bank\n",
       "each with their own unique personalities. These characters are each fun enough to deserve their own movie and we're lucky to have been given the TOY STORY sequels to return to this world. I really enjoy the film overall (as do just about everyone I know who's seen it) and there is little to complain about. It's amazing to see how well the animation stands up after so many years. You can see that the computer graphics aren't as smooth as modern CG, but it's still near seamless. Pixar's first film is a classic I was happy to introduce to my daughter. Cynical and disturbing; This is one film that left me with a very sour aftertaste.  Yes, it's animated with character and vigour, and there are some fine -- if over the top -- voice performances.  However, there are some very disturbing aspects to the film.  The first is that it's like nothing so much as watching a 90 minute advert.  Even if merchandising hadn't been released to support the film, all the supporting cast could already by bought in your local toy shop.  I'm sure I wasn't the only viewer who found this more than a little suspect. Possible spoiler: The second, perhaps larger, point against the film lies in the characterisation of the two boys, Andy and Sid.  Andy is the \"good\" boy. He plays safely and passively with his toys, they don't do anything toys wouldn't do.  Sid, the \"bad\" boy is more creative.  He adapts toys to fit his own vision, he's an innovator, a creator.  It's this very creativity of his that is portrayed as a bad thing.  Sid isn't the ideal target audience for this film: he wouldn't be satisfied with row after row of identical shop-bought toys, he would much rather make his own.  I guess this review is being written for all the Sids out there, who are demonised and vilified by this ultra-corporate nightmare of a film. Wonderful Film One of Pixar's Best; I love animated Disney films, although I must say I usually prefer the original classic hand drawn Disney films, at some point we have to accept change, and what better way to accept this change with a wonderful superb film. (I mean common they booked Toy Story 4 already). Toy's come to life when their owner is asleep, and its all about the battle for who is the best and most popular toy. Whenever Christmas or the little boy's birthday come around the toys get nervous that they will be abandoned or replaced. When a new toy arrives they are determined to hate him and ignore him, but they end up becoming friends. It was a privilege witnessing this film-making achievement.; Pixar started with a big bang: Toy Story. I loved this film as a kid and all the more as an adult. Every moment in this film is memorable, great or small. Don't tell me you don't remember parts like Andy's playtime with Mr. Potatohead as the villain, that mosquito on Buzz's visor, Pizza Planet, or at least one of the twisted toys. The way the story is put together is simple yet clever. The characters are lovable and are all equally important to the story. I may not have realized back then that I was seeing the first cgi animated feature film but I am somewhat glad I didn't know about that. Having to enjoy the film sincerely is way better than that. It's still a privilege seeing this on it's original date. The Largest Part Of My Childhood Put On Screen.; With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. \"Toy Story\" was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises & confidence. How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history. I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling & technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals & entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks & Tim Allen, and almost immediately think \"Toy Story\". As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then. Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, \"Toy Story\" is that proof. 10/10. Great Fun For Kids And Adults Alike; Toy Story is one of those rare animated movies, designed for children, that adults can enjoy. Plot In A Paragraph: Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) is 8 year old Andy's favourite toy, however his world falls apart when Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) figure for his birthday and he has to play second fiddle to the new space ranger. I loved this movie. Over the years I have watched it with both my kids and nieces and nephews and they have all enjoyed it. Watching it now, it has lost none of its charm. Tom Hanks is superb as Woody, Tim Allen (who I'm not a fan of) is delightful as the deluded Buzz Lightyear who is not aware he is an action figure, but for me the stand out voice was John Ratzenberger as Pork Chop the Piggy Bank. simply a timeless classic; this movie is one of the best, if not the best animated movie i have ever seen. i have seen this feel so many times, and yet every time i see it is has the same magic as when i first saw it. i would strongly recommend this film to anyone that has a shred of taste. suitable for adults and children alike. there is nothing this film doesn't have. hilarious and sweet. the voice actors finish this movie off, and it will stay on your mind for a very long time. i have seen all of the pixar movies i can think of, and by far this stands out as the best. how anyone doesn't like this movie i don't know. such a simple story, that we all dreamt up when we were young, is captured in an incredible fashion. this movie simply would not work as well if it was normal cartoon. followed up by an equally good movie, it is easy to say that you will never see another movie that captures your childhood as well as this does the plot is simple, and never feels to simple or complicated. there is never a second where there is confusion, or there is not something that the audience will like. attention is captured and maintained. Technically impressive with great script and sharp wit; Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence. Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula. The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads. Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors.  Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz.  Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults. Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things! 4th best film of all time!; This is the first movie I ever saw. I grew up with this film and loved ever since I was little. A few movies surpass it, but every other film iv'e ever seen is inferior. This is one of the big ones. It takes a lot to live up to this film. Its one of the most popular films, if not the most popular film of all time! Tom Hanks and Tim Allen head the lead voice cast. A cowboy doll named Woody, whose been the favorite of his owner, Andy since he first got him, is in for it when he's replaced by the latest and hottest new toy, Buzz Lightyear, (Tim Allen). A few accidents here and there get them stranded in the middle of nowhere, causing them to team up to get back home. If the story isn't enough to pull you in, (which it should be anyway) then the beautiful animation, the brilliant voices, and the funny jokes will be more than enough. Of course, iv'e seen the movie so many times, I know about each scene and each fact of the movie by heart. Even after all these times watching it, I still manage to laugh at it a little. Everybody whose anybody has seen, or at least heard of this film. I don't know a single person who hasn't seen this. All I can say left is that its one of the greatest and touching films of all time. Except for a few other films, nothing passes this film! An Instant Classic!; After a few short films and no major recognition-in 1991, Pixar set out to start the ball rolling for computer-animated entertainment and in 1995 unleashed not just a mere film but a work of art. An instant classic when first released...Toy Story went on to earn nearly $400 million worldwide and capture the hearts of children and adults alike with its unforgettable characters, magical musical score, hilarious script and the classic quote \"To infinity and beyond\". Woody (Tom Hanks) is an old-fashioned pull - string cowboy doll living a life of luxury as the favourite toy of a young boy named Andy. Surrounded by a colourful cast of characters - such as the cynical Mr. Potato Head, the wisecracking Piggy bank Hamm and Woody's brown-nosing second-in-command Slinky Dog - Woody seems something of a king. However, when a new toy arrives on the scene-a high tech spaceman action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Woody suddenly loses his popularity. But this toy comes with a surreal extra feature - he thinks he's the real Buzz Lightyear!! In the effort of removing Buzz as Andy's favourite toy-both toys are swept out of their home, and into the outside world where they unite reluctantly in friendship for an adventure home. The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in 1937 lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Pixar begins; I recently went to see the double feature which included \"Toy Story\" and \"Toy Story 2\" and I don't know if it's the nostalgia kicking in but it was still quite fun. I mean it wasn't good as when I first saw it when it came out when I was in elementary school, but it was still pretty entertaining and brought back some memories. The animation was amazing, and phenomenal when it first came out and still holds up today. The voice actors even did a great job, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did a great job with there performance in portraying Woody and Buzz Lightyear. It was a exciting adventure, although the plot was simple it was effective and entertaining.The story is about toys coming to life, but keeping themselves secret by acting like they aren't alive. But the toys coexist with humans peacefully, except the toys in Andy's room get worried on birthdays and Christmases of being replaced. Thus when Andy's favorite toy get replaced by a new favorite toy, the conflict starts from there when the older toy that was Andy's favorite tries to hide the new toy, but ends up hitting it out the window. Although this day and age, kid's who are about Andy' age probably won't play with the types of toys portrayed in the movie, and the magic was sort of lost from when I saw it when I was in elementary. This movie is still ahead of it's time, by a large margin. 8.5/10 An amazing family film; Toy Story is a timeless classic. Probably the most genuine, innocent, simplistic yet powerful attempt to create a children film which appeals both adults and kids alike. It is the story of how two rival 'living' toys - a old western cowboy toy (Woody) and action figure of a space commander (Buzz Lightyear) become best friends under some dangerous circumstances. There are bunch of numerals toys like Mr. Potato, a Barbie, a magnifying toy, a truck, alien toys and many more. The film is crafted so well that within some few minutes of the film, you are intrigued to it. It is a fascinating film, with amazing characterization. The toys are so believable that you feel close to them. You feel cherished when Allan and his company make a spoiled brat kid Sid (who loves blowing up toys) realize how important is to save toys which bring back the memories of childhood. I must say the script is effortless and very well written. Music by Randy Newman is also great. One striking thing in this film are its sound effects and CGI which are considered ground-breaking for a 1995 film. Overall, the film is highly recommended. Not only for children, but for everyone who love cherishing the childhood memories - the lovely Toys. fantastic; Toy Story i think is a fantastic animated movie to watch. This movie was rated as a PG (Parental Guildence) This movie was made in 1995. This is fantastic to watch, i got to tell ya. It is an amazing animated movie. I give this movie 10 out of 10. As Good as It Gets!; What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It's a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can't really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the \"humanity\" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute. The movie that changed all animations that were to come; Even though there were other animation classics such as Lion King, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, no other animation movie, prior to this, had being a 3D Computer Animated Film making this one of the most ground-breaking films of all time. This movie is also unique in every sense. Even though the movie is targeted for children and is the movie that every single child watches during their child hood, its so good that even adults absolutely love it. The film follows the tale of Andy's toys who are, unknown to all humans, actually alive. During the movie, as Buzz, Andy's new toy comes, Sheriff Woody becomes jealous of Buzz as he becomes Andy's new favorite and attempts to put an end to it but Buzz gets his revenge. However, the two get captured by Sid, the evil kid next door that enjoys torturing toys and must try their best to escape. To be fair, this movie is one of the shortest films I've ever seen but also one of the most enjoyable. The voice acting for the film is just masterful. Tom Hanks voice acting of Woody is just brilliant and Tim Allen as Buzz was brilliant. The voice acting just added further strength to every aspect of the film. The animations for a 1995 film, being the first 3D animated film, is just visually amazing! Though it may not stand out against recent visual animations, this movie is just a joy to watch, even after 18 years! One thing that is incredibly cool is that they don't explain how exactly the toys ever were alive and its great to see such thing left anonymous. I also found the characters extremely entertaining and the way that Buzz and Woody become friends during the film is just well made! Also, having your main characters toys and in fact making a movie entirely based on toys can be some pain and something which people just laugh at but in this film, we as an audience are emotionally connected to these plastic toys! Its because, despite being toys, the director portrays these as human like things which makes it extremely interesting to us. The dialogue in the film is great and as a result it constantly made me laugh. I loved that little kid as a villain. I thought he was fascinating and I'm glad that very little time is spent about Andy. Despite being made for children all adults are sure to have a blast with this film. In fact, I don't see why nobody has yet to see this film. In case you haven't, be sure to remember that this film changed all animation films to come and that this is surely one of Pixar's ever most finest films! Simply, the best animated film of them all.; Disney used to be good, wholesome family entertainment that was not only clean but fun. Now, most everything they put out is outdated postmodern trash that portrays all children as geniuses able to rule the world and all parents as evil minions trying to keep their children from having fun. Thank God for Pixar coming to existence. Starting with Toy Story in 1995, they made a great family film that appeals to adult humor as well as children. They haven't failed since. They can do no wrong it seems, and I pray it continues that way. Of all their great films, this is undoubtedly in my mind the best of them all. It is also arguably better than any animated film Disney ever did, including the classics of the 1940s and 50s. The premise is so clever and daring in that it could go wrong in so many ways. It never does, though, and in a mere 82 minutes, it covers more information than many other 2 hour films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have become iconic in their roles as Woody and Buzz. The animation and dialogue is so good it is as if they are really on screen arguing with one another. The supporting characters are also very good and funny. With animation, perhaps the most important aspect is the voice characters. Pixar has done a great job of not always going with a star to do the voices, but rather simply going with the one that fits the character best. Overall, Toy Story is superb film-making with a great script, wonderful voices and animation that still impresses despite all the technological improvements. Thank you, Pixar. I am truly grateful to you for saving animated films. one of the best movies of 1995; toy story is another successful Disney 90s flick of the 90s followed by A goofy movie The lion king and inspector gadget 1 and the other 90s Disney movies this one is so outstanding its about toys that come to life when their owner is not looking and are feared about getting replaced if you can remember Johnson and friends the kids TV series where toys come to life and feared that they are going to be replace but that has nothing to do with this very successful movie I love this movie to bits its good fun and great for kids and adults too if you have toys in your room you night think they are alive trust me you can think of it so if you love Disney movies like A goofy movie Herbie the love bug The lion king or other very successful Disney movies from the 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s or the early 2000s then you will love this one its great to have for your Disney DVD or VHS sets. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 because people really love it. Brilliant, Simply Brilliant Film; Sometimes, just Sometimes, A Disney film is released and is made into a classic. Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, Bambi are just a few of the classics. But My all time fave Disney films are the ones made by Pixar. Toy Story, is my third favourite Disney Film. The story revolves around a toy cowboy called Woody (Tom Hanks, who does an excellent job)who is owned by Andy, a 4 year old boy. On Andy's birthday, he recieves a Buzz Lightyear action figure (Tim Allen, who does an unforgettable job as Buzz). Buzz slowly becomes Andy's favourite, leaving Woody Jealous, he schemes to purposely lose Buzz, but his plan backfires, leaving him and Buzz away from home. I won't reveal much else, but the Idea is so clever, well.. It's hard not to. This is an excellent film, 10/10 Rubbish movie, so many plot holes...; I don't understand why this film is so highly rated. The film has so many plot holes in it I actually lost count. Now before I start this review, I'm not going to say toys talking is a plot hole, the idea of them talking is interesting but it opens up so many other questions that the movie never really explains. Also, don't argue, \"it's a kids movie\", films need to make sense in order to work whether they're for kids or not. This film is so bad and here is why. Even if you like this film, you have to agree with some of the points I'm making here: Buzz thinks he's a space ranger. If that is the case then why does he allow Andy to play with him? Does he not think why is this giant kid picking me up and throwing me around? Buzz however makes no attempt to communicate with Andy. Surely Buzz would try and talk to him? This doesn't make sense given that Buzz doesn't believe he's a toy. Also when Woody hits a button that release Buzz's helmet and he gasps for air, you're telling me Andy never pushed that button? He's owned the toy for weeks yet hadn't pressed all the buttons? Rubbish. The end scene is one of the worst scenes for me. It's broad daylight and two toys are running down a street. Where are all the pedestrians on the street? How are they able to open the back of the moving van truck? Surely the driver would notice doesn't he check his rear view mirrors, or surely a button or signal would come up revealing that a door was open at the back of his truck? Wow any thief could steal from this useless driver. Also when Woody and Buzz fly down from the sky and land in Andy's car. Andy's car is directly in front of the truck driver, how could he possibly not see this??? The most hilarious scene though is when Woody is moving around in the middle of the road and a person in a car honks at him. Woody then ducks in front of the car as it drives over him. 1) Why would you sound your car horn if there was a toy in the road? 2) The driver therefore saw Woody as he sounded his horn. 3) He must have seen Woody moving about and be thrown from the moving van. Does this driver know toys are alive or something? Is it only kids who are unaware? I just don't understand. It's never fully explained. Continuing this point: when the toys all surround Woody and prepare to attack him after he knocks Buzz out the window, we hear Andy from outside shouting. This allows them to return into position. What if he hadn't have shouted though? He would have walked in and seen them. This is why this idea of toys coming to life could never work! No kid would always shout when they enter their room and most kids leave their doors open yet Andy never does - allowing the toys to move around and communicate. Once you take these plot holes into account, the conclusion is that the film sucks and is a really poor movie. Honestly how could anyone like it? An interesting idea that just falls flat. And also the final question that is never addressed is: Why can't toys reveal they're alive to humans??? It's never explained and I don't get why. Poor film 1 star. Awful. Classic Tale Full of Imagination; Toy Story (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) A kid's toy room is split after his former favorite toy Woody (Tom Hanks) gets replaced with the newest sensation Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). The gunslinger Woody can't except the fact that he's no longer the kid's favorite so he and Buzz end up outside of the house and must try and find a way back. The Pixar form of animation has become the standard today so I'm sure many people watching these films forget how groundbreaking this movie was when it was first released. I was only fifteen at the time but giving it a second viewing after all these years just reminds me at why this thing became a hit. Not only is the animation beautiful and extremely life like but we also got a terrific screenplay that certainly brings these characters to life and really makes them something special. The idea of a film being centered on toys that come to life when no one is looking is something so simple yet so genius that you can't help but wonder why it took someone so long to do a film. The screenplay is without question one of the best ever written for an animation movie as all of the characters, from Woody and Buzz to Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) are perfectly brought to life. The child-like nature of the story has so much energy that you can't help but smile at each journey that the toys find themselves on. The amount of imagination in the screenplay is what makes it so special because it really does seem like something a kid would come up with while playing alone in his room with the toys. Everyone can remember what it was like being a kid and playing with these toys and bringing them to life in our minds so to see that played out on the screen is certainly something special. The film has terrific laughs but also a nice message. The voice work is terrific with Hanks and Allen clearly leading the way but that Southern draw of Varney is special as well. TOY STORY was ground breaking when originally released and it comes as no shock that the film hasn't lost any of its impact. The screenplay with its great characters and story is guaranteed to be enjoyed for decades to come. Not just for children!; This is an awesome movie, and it's not just for kids! When I read this in the memorable quotes: Mr. Potato Head: How come you don't have a laser, Woody? Woody: It's not a laser! It's a little light that blinks! Hamm: What's wrong with him? Mr. Potato Head: Laser envy. I knew that this movie wasn't completely aimed at small children. But there were a few things that bothered me. How Andy plays with his toys so nicely, and Sid just takes apart toys and puts them together with other different parts. Isn't that a sign of creativity? Otherwise, this movie was great! Overall this movie gets a 9/10!!!  \n",
       "1  5 + 5 : « addictive and fun as a real game » (tv); I saw a little bit long ago and it seemed dull then. This time, i start another play right from the start and i found it still dull : the young boy appears a bit dumb, his wealthy family not better \n",
       " And then, first comes teen Dunst and i'm really surprised how good she acted (as she never convinced me as Peter's girlfriend). Next, Robin gets in the movie getting out the game and the magic operates : i really like the way past, present and future merge, how the game expands to the big mansion into town. If the special effects looks very tired, the story is original, full of surprises and proves that a humble cast can do as fine as a multiple billion dollars one ! Robin proved one more time he was a never grown-up kid with a beautiful soul with kids and the key to childish fun ! So i had a great time with this small movie as it gives me all i ask to cinema : to find a way to leave (cautiously) my world behind !! Probably worth checking out, even today; There is a lot to like in this movie. The concept was intriguing. Robin Williams plays a basic Robin Williams character, i.e. a man-child. I never would have recognized Kirsten Dunst or Laura Bell Bradley as children without the cast list, but they both performed well. David Alan Grier did befuddlement just as well back then as he does now. Bebe Neuwirth and Bonnie Hunt did nicely, and looked very nice as well. The pace got a bit frenetic for me, though I understand that this was deliberate. The CGI animals looked fine in the distance but up close, not so much. I know we are spoiled by the unlimited effects in films today, but some of these, like the lion, looked terrible. I saw in the credits that they had Industrial Light & Magic, so I doubt it could have been done any better at the time. And some of the things in the ending did not seem to totally follow from the body of the film. It's probably worth checking out though, even today. Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Almost 20 years on and it's still entertaining kids of all ages; Jumanji was on TV today, and my 8 year old son had liked him in \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and I remembered it being fun, so with sweets and crisps we sat down to watch it. Orphans Judy (A young Kristen Dunst, who had started in \"An Interview With A Vampire\" the previous year, but still a few years away from Spiderman fame) and Peter move in to a mansion with their Aunt (Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers) where the find a board game called Jumanji. When they start playing, they free Alan Parish (Robin Williams) who was trapped in the game when he was a child. Robin Williams is always fun to watch and he was very popular at the time, due to movies like \"Aladdin\" and \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and Kristen Dunst was a real talent as a young actress, none of the annoying traits of usual child actors. Of the supporting cast David Alan Grier is fun as a hapless Police Officer, as is Jonathan Hyde in duel roles as a hunter and young Alan's Dad. Defo worth checking out if you have kids, and more than enjoyable even if you don't. Some of the special effects have dated badly, but are still OK, most of the humour is spot on too. My son got a big kick out if it and really enjoyed it. And I thought for a 19 year old special effects laden kids movie it had held up pretty well. review for jumanji.; This 1995 film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game 26 years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are 8+ as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than 8 and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark wild CGI destruction gets repetitive; In 1869, two boys bury a mysterious dangerous wooden chest. In 1969 Brantford, New Hampshire, young Alan Parrish gets picked on by bullies. He finds the box in a local construction site. He opens the chest to find a board game Jumanji. His father is sending him to boarding school. He is about to run away when his best friend Sarah Whittle comes by. They play the game and Alan is pulled into the board game. Twenty six years later, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) buys the rundown mansion planning to open a bed-and-breakfast. She brings her niece Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter (Bradley Pierce) who lost their parents in a car accident. The kids find the board game in the attic and start playing it. Alan (Robin Williams) is released. They track down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) to finish the game and bring all the released apparitions to an end. Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) was a friend who worked at Alan's shoe factory and is now a cop. The game brings out big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) who looks like Alan's father Sam. The basic idea of a board game that comes alive is one with great possibilities. I wish that it is more than just a series of crazy CGI destruction. I wish that the players needed to use their brain power to solve clues. The constant escaping from one thing to the next gets a little bit repetitive. They start piling on top of one another. Williams is not quite as lovable as expected. Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier are kind of fun. There is an uncontrolled quality to this children's movie. once it gets going it's pretty darn fun; i have t say,this movie started out pretty slow,and i thought it was gonna be a dud.i'm glad i kept watching.it turned into a pretty good movie.if you're into action and adventure,you'll certainly find it in abundance here.there are some great action sequences,providing scads of excitement.but there are also a lot of very funny moments,and there's even a hint or 2 of romance.there are some fantastic creatures here.the only downside i can think of is the visual effects.i found them kinda cheesy,and sometimes they didn't quite look real.the creatures sometimes looked a bit wonky,but other times were pretty realistic.but that's a small downside,since the movie is so much fun.Robin Williams is the featured performer here,but i thought Bonnie Hunt was terrific.Bebe Neuwirth was very good as well.but David Alan Grier was a riot.Kirsten Dunst was good too.overall, this is a good movie for both kids and adults.for me,Jumani is a 7/10 Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. Watchable Effects-laden family entertainer, though a bit predictable; This is a watchable family entertainer with some genuine scares. The plot appears complicated but is actually fairly simple. Hordes of wild animals appear and people flee. This happens again and again like clockwork throughout the film making it predictable after a while. On the plus side, Robin Williams is in manic form, and the Special Effects are agreeable though dated. Kirsten Dunst is very appealing in one of her earlier films. This is generally a pleasant watch, but on the whole, I prefer the newer film Zathura, which is also based on a board game. Overall 6/10 Still great to this day.; \"Jumanji\" is still fun to watch, it's an original story and has great performances, directing and dialogue. The film score composed by James Horner is fantastic. The special effects are damn good for it's day. There's no need for a sequel/reboot/remake or whatever the hell it is, it's cheapened this 90s classic. If they want to be respectful then leave this movie alone, stop trying to recreate something that won't work! Almost Thoroughly Enjoyable; If I had been 10 or 12 when this movie came out it would probably be my favorite.  As I was 34, my first reaction was that there was too much screaming. But there's much here for an imaginative youngster (or oldster) to enjoy.  The script is generally witty, and except for the screaming, parents will not be bored watching it -- and if they squint their minds eyes enough to remember what they enjoyed before puberty, they'll get a nostalgic rush. This is everything family entertainment should be.  And though it does involve the supernatural, it is presented in a negative light and none of the characters relish being part of it. Dated, but fun adventure for kids and adults alike; When Steven Spielberg launched 'Jurassic Park' in the summer of 1993, it broke major grounds in the visual effects department leaving everyone with their jaw dropping at the splendid computer-generated imagery of the dinosaurs. The success of the Spielberg brought birth to a new image of computer-generated effects as well special effects to the feast the eyes of viewers everywhere. This fantasy adventure based on the Award-winning children's book Jumanji by Chris Van Allsburg invites audiences for fun adventure in the jungle with computer-generated animals that hit a mark in the state-of-the-art territory at the time of its release, but unlike the superior Jurassic Park sadly look dated and unauthentic by comparison. That is certainly not to say however, that the fun of the magical fantasy excursion and the charm of the highly popular Robin Williams no longer remains. Set in 1995, the film follows a young boy named Peter Shepard (played by Bradley Pierce) and his sister Judy (played by Kirsten Dunst) who discover a mysterious game in the attic of the home 12-year old Alan Parrish (played by Adam-Hann Byrd) disappeared in twenty-six years ago. Upon rolling the dice, Peter and Judy unexpectedly release a thirty-something year old Alan (played by Robin Williams) who reveals to have disappeared into the game. Witnessing the magical powers of the game, Alan, Peter, and Judy team up along with Alan's old friend Sarah (played by Bonnie Hunt) to survive against the horde of jungle animals that threaten to destroy the town until someone finished the game. Lions, elephants, rhinos, monkeys, monsoons, carnivorous plants; all menacing obstacles our characters must overcome as the titular board game send their world in a mysterious jungle-like realm. It is a wild ride brought to life by the a smart execution by director Joe Johnston who knows the magic of Chris Van Allsburg's source material, and translation from book-to-screen by a screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh and Greg Taylor. But the question is \"has it aged well\". In terms of visual effects, the answer is sadly no as the computer generated imagery of the wild animals that release from the board game unfortunately fail to come to life as believable and striking as they did back in 1995. While the film's use of animatronics used on the some of the animals such as the lion have aged well in a way that can send shivers down your in the scene when the hairy creature threatens our young heroes, most of the effects look awfully dated and show evidence of a blockbuster flick released in the mid-1990s. Despite the lack of authenticity perpetrated by these subpar effects, the film luckily manages to stay fun and charming, especially by the comedic charm of Robin Williams who swarms in the movie with livelihood and humility as well as the rest of the cast including Bradley Pierce, Kirsten Dunst, and Bonnie Hunt. As the story progresses, viewers are in for a fair amount of dark, eerie elements including the death of the children's parents, Alan's broken relationship with his father, and the overall chaos that erupts from the game; all of which are enough to leave young children shivering. But with the fun-filled action uprooted in the adventure of the characters, there is still plenty for the family to enjoy. Jumanji may show its age in terms of the effects department, but is still a fun-filled adventure full of laughs, heart, and suspense to keep both kids and adults alike captivated from start to finish. Yes, it is disappointing that it fails to reach the roots of Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park; but that doesn't stop this fantasy adventure of being a friendly, fantasy spectacle. not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late 1960s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. Jumanji! From Book to Film; As a child in 1995, this was one of the greatest adventure films for a kid in my generation. The book from where it came, was good, but the filmmakers made the adaptation pretty darn amazing. The fact that Robin Williams starred made the film better, as Robin was a huge draw to family films of that era. Who ever knew that Jumanji would have a cult following or that it would spawn an actual board game (nothing comes to life), and eventually a sequel in 2017. Too bad Robin isn't here to enjoy or be a part of the sequel. Bonnie Hunt also starred alongside Robin in this film as Sarah, but she's not quite as memorable. Sorry! David Alan Grier also co-starred as Carl the police officer, his acting was somewhat more memorable. One of the most memorable acting performances of the film was Jonathan Hyde as Sam Parrish (Alan's dad) and his dual role as Van Pelt (the hunter from Jumanji). In the end, it was a great film, probably felt more now by some since the passing of Robin Williams. But those of us who've loved the film since the beginning know he made the film what it was. Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Pretty cute, zany adventure.; Let me start this by saying that Robin Was the main draw to this work, although the story is pretty innovative, only having been done a time or two previously. Zany. That's the principal description of this work, between Williams's near-manic performance and the fast-paced action, the busy screenplay, and the frantic sound effects. It was fun and entertaining, if nothing else. Features some monsters and over-sized creatures, so may not be suitable for all ages. It rates a 5.4/10 from... the Fiend :. Wish they had more Jumanji history; My only real complaint with Jumanji is where did this game come from? Who created it? I really wish they could have discovered more about the game's past, it's history. Then it would have made a little more sense. But I'm not saying I didn't like it. On the contrary, I do enjoy it very much, I think it's a cool buried treasure. The characters, the story, the effects all perfect. The cast does a great job in this movie and the concept of a strange magical board game works. I wish there was more monster animals. But the man eating plant and the giant spiders is enough to put it on my page. Robin Williams does great in this first monster movie, wish he do more. But that's just me. Anyway, in conclusion ladies and jelly spoons. This is an assume movie and you can do much worse then Jumanji. 8 STARS. Imaginative (spoiler); This is probably one of the most imaginative movies I have seen in a while. I mean, it has an entire back story, as we can see in the beginning, when those two kids are trying to get rid of the game. Then it goes to 1969, when Alan finds the game, he and Sarah start playing, and he gets sucked into Jumanji. Then, throughout the rest of the movie, Alan comes out of the jungle and he, Sarah, Judy, and Peter continue playing the game and unleashing all these dangerous animals (and Van Pelt) and the monsoon and killer plants into the city. And at the end, those kids in Japan find the game. Very well thought out. Certainly worth a look. An excellent family entertainment achievement, with the keyword family, not just kids.; The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children's book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die! Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter  I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families. Outrageous fun; When young Alan Parish and his childhood friend, Sarah play a board game that Alan found buried near his fathers business, Alan is sucked into the game and left to grow up alone in the jungle. That is until two young children, Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) join the game and release him 26 years later. Every turn in the game becomes a living nightmare that endangers the lives of everyone involved, and the only way to stop it is finish the game. Alan (Robin Williams) and Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) will have to play some more if there lives are return to normality. The concept of the movie is truly original and it successfully delivers on its potential, with an excellent cast and funny script, this adventure is both hilarious and action packed, with some cool special effects thrown in. Great family entertainment 8/10 Very enjoyable fantasy adventure.; Jumanji starts in 1969 in New Hampshire in New England where a young boy named Alan Parish (Adam Hann-Byrdd) & his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) starts playing a strange board game called Jumaji that Alan found buried in the ground earlier, Jumanji turns out to be magical & Alan is sucked into the board game while Sarah runs off. Twenty six years later & it's 1995 & Alan's old house has been empty for years until now, until young brother & sister Judy (Kirsten Dunst) & Peter (Bradley Pierce) move in with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), the two youngsters find the Jumanji game & start playing it themselves as all manner of creatures & climate events begin to appear as does Alan (Robin Williams) who has spent the last twenty six years trapped inside Jumanji & is now an adult. The only way to reverse the effects of Jumanji is to finish the game so with a now adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) the four players must battle whatever Jumanji throw's at them including Lions, Monsoon's, giant Spider's & a stampede... Girected by former special effects man Joe Johnston this oddball fantasy adventure is actually pretty good but there are one or two things that ultimately drag it down to merely a very good film rather than a great film in my opinion. Based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsberg the film is apparently quite different & the two main character's here Alan & Sarah don't even appear in the book, Jumanji is a hard film to categorise as it mixes various ideas & themes like a bad childhood, finding redemption, standing up to your fears, fantasy, sci-fi, horror & comedy. At 100 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace, once it gets going the situation just keeps getting worse & worse as all the chaos & mayhem escalates beyond anyone's control with all sorts of animals running around & the theme of facing your fears is an ever present one. I am not sure there is another film quite like Jumanji & to find something so original & different in a mainstream film is unusual but the CGI effects scenes, the lack of character depth, the refusal to do anything with the plot other than destroy a house & an ultra happy ending which goes on forever that gives every character in the film the best most happy ending is pure Hollywood that was not needed & a slightly darker ending in keeping with the slightly darker tone of the film overall would have been much better. To be honest apart from great set-pieces & the basic concept there's really not that much to Jumanji at all, it's rather shallow & it's attempts at depth are pure heavy handed Hollywood cliché but it's fun & very entertaining while it lasts, just a shame about the last ten minutes really. Jumanji was made just as the CGI computer graphic revolution was taking off back in the mid 90's but the effects do hold up rather well actually, from huge plants to an impressive stampede of Rhino's & Elephant's through a house to a huge Lion with the mischievous Monkey's probably the only real weak effect. As a fairly light hearted fantasy adventure with some darker overtones there's a few amusing moments including a bemused policeman who's car is slowly & systematically trashed & as a whole the film delights in needless destruction & mayhem which is no bad thing. There are some laughs & a few scares as well & I could definitely see Jumanji appealing to both older & younger audiences. With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 this had a very healthy amount spent on it with most going towards the effects I would have thought. Filmed in New Hampshire & British Columbia in Canada. Despite being known as a manic performer Robin Williams is pretty restrained here & his brand of psychical comedy isn't used much, Kirsten Dunst is one of the few child stars to go on & have a successful adult career while the acting generally is pretty good. Jumanji is a unique fantasy adventure that I think would appeal to both children & adults, my only real problem is the sweeter than sweet happier than happy ending which is pure sentimental Hollywood at it's worst. With an ending more in keeping with the rest of the film Jumanji might have got a seven from but as it is it gets a six, good but not great. Followed by Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005) which was shot under the title Jumanji 2. An original plot poorly executed; I was really disappointed with Jumanji. I had heard about the concept and was looking forward to it. It is mean a mean spirited slap stick comedy with no redeeming social value. First of all, you have Robin Williams....I love Williams, when he is kept on a short leash by the director. Left to his own devices he tends to go off the deep end a bit. Then you add the lame script and an over-done score, you get a movie that misses. I gave this movie a 4 because it was an original concept, it had some great cinematography and it had a few really cool special effects. I would love to see this movie remade by a different director a better script writer. Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Unique; I am trying to find my words in order to perfectly describe Robin, but i just realized that it's impossible to do it. Words are not enough to describe such a man... I've seen a lot of people in my life, all kind of people, but i never saw someone having so much warmth and kindness in just a small smile like Robin. That's something which makes you to love him unconditionally. The way he acted in the movies was so original that it can not be compared with anyone else in the history of cinema. He's smile made us all better people a little bit, which means he changed the world in he's own way. He will be always with us, and within us. Let's make him immortal !!! The best of Allsburgh's film adaptations.; Author Chris Van Allburgh has had three film adaptations. His most recent was Zathura, which I didn't like. Before that, The Polar Express was released and re-released. I don't know why because I did't like it that much either. But ten years before Zathura was his first film adaptation, Jumanji. The only one I liked. The only one that critics disliked. Jumanji, for some reason, was a film that I really liked. I'll admit some of it was a bit weird, but I really liked it. I liked it because of Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, two great actors. People don't give Williams enough credit and the same with Hunt. But I love both of them. I also think the film has great visuals and it's a triumph with entertainment. I can understand why critics would call it weird, but I really liked it. You may disagree with me. But there's something about Jumanji that I really liked but I can't think of what exactly it is. Though some parts are kind of odd, Jumanji grabs my attention and I'm recommending it. The Plot: When two kids find a magical board game, they release tons of animals and a person who once played the game when he was younger. This game is like no other.; Roll doubles and look out.  Elaborate special effects highlight this tale about two kids who release an imprisoned player trapped for decades in a supernatural board game. Story line is quite stupid, but this is so much fun to watch. Robin Williams does his thing. A young Kirsten Dunst is charming in this preview of her future talents. Rounding out this mish-mash of a cast are: Bebe Neuwirth, David Alan Grier, Bradley Pierce, Bonnie Hunt and Jonathan Hyde in a dual role. Special effects and sight gags are redeeming. A dark, mysterious, and entertaining childhood favorite of mine; Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good. The end is near!; 'The end is near' was my best thought after an hour of Jumanji. The end of the movie that is. Despite a lot of good reviews of people I hardly know, this film is a first-class let-down. It is the somanieth movie in which Robin Williams comic qualities are abused. The story is about a game, Jumanji, that has come to life. After every move something terrible happens; a stampede or a giant spider attack. The game has to be finished to stop all terrible things happening. Of course Williams' comic talent and the special effects try to safe the movie but everything is overdone. By memory, I recall that the makers promised great special effects; they had used the same effects as Jurassic Park! Yes, they did, but they obviously only got the demo version of the package. Also, poor Kirsten Dunst, having the role of a nice young girl, is transformed is such a prig that all her good intentions fall into nothing. All in all, if you have to choose between watching this movie and cleaning up the house, please clean up your house starting with trashing the video of this movie. This is family entertainment; When two children play a board game a man trapped inside appears and tries to help them finish the game as jungle elements from the game trouble the environment. Shown every Christmas, re-released countless times and still Jumanji never loses its touch with its viewers. This breathtaking imagination of a board game coming to life is as wonderfully exuberant as toys coming to life in Pixar's first film. The concept of a game coming to life is made even more exciting by encoding prospects of deadly animals such as lions, mysterious mosquitoes and violent talented monkeys. Everything is thought of and what a treat we have in our hands. There is now a new definition of family entertainment, known as Pixar. Since releasing Toy Story after this was released they have been dominating the box office with wonderful family tales about sentimental robots, cooking rats and racing cars. And to rewind the clock back 14 years this picture is to be hailed as the beginning of the end. A truly new concept with very little explanation required and a marvellous array of hormonal characters with breathtaking action and enough humour to make you smile, this was and still is marvellous. Family entertainment now either involves a boy with a wand, Harry something, or sitting in your living room watching Simon Cowell make fun of ordinary folk. The reprisal if you want to call it that of non-animated picture was in 2005 where Jon Favreau attempted a step up from this picture, by using the same concept of a board game coming to life and applied it with a sci-fi edge, set in space. Whilst there were moments of good action it boiled down to being a repetitive ideology of this 1995 classic with not enough quick wit and mistimed action sequences with an egregious sentimental intention of brotherly love. This has none of that. There are no overly soppy sentimental parts as the required drama is justified early on. The action continues consistently with first initial deadly elements before the stakes are raised. Van Pelt adds a sharp intake of breath threw his evidently evil hunter, which actually is never properly explained, but that is the point. Nothing is explained, events just happen and we can sit back and enjoy the fun spilling out from every angle. Johnston is the man in the know as the adventure flows with exquisite timing. The scene with the house flood is a perfect example whilst the monkey motorbike stage shows his ability to do comedy. This truly is a remarkable film and is worth watching again and again for its wondrous story, its lovable collection of characters and easy sharp mind. This is family entertainment! good original family movie; Joe Johnston's Jumanji is very good family movie that is well paced. The movie is the story of a mysterious game that involves it's players more than the normal board game. The movie begins with a young boy, Alan Parrish, finding the abandoned game. He talks the girl he has a crush on, Sarah Whittle, into playing with him. Once the game starts, chaos ensues. Robin Williams carries this movie, giving it life. The other actors do okay with the bare dialogue. Joe Johnston uses the experiences on the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies to craft a fantasy world that is believable. Though not outstanding in any way, Jumanji is a fun movie that should delight children with its action and fantasy. 6 out of 10 stars. Very cute, feel good movie; I gave Jumanji 7 out 10, which is a pretty good rating from me. 10 are epics like Gone With The Wind & Lawrence of Arabia, 9 are classics and 8 the near great. 7, like Jumanji, are just good, clean fun; not Oscar worthy movies, but movies worth watching. Robin Williams delivers a fairly straight performance for him, but it works, it is good acting. Kirsten Dunst, does a great job as his love interest and former playmate. Other roles by David Alan Grier, Bonnie Hunt, Jonathan Hyde and Bebe Neuwirth fill out the cast nicely along with the child actors who play Peter & Judy and the young Alan & Sarah. Jumangi was one of the better, more successful films to come out of TriStar. One of my favourite films ever; This film is great, it is definitely a family film (little kids might get scared when there are *SPOILER* guns shooting or when the giant spiders have surrounded the actors,or when a crocodile attacks the man but apart from that it isn't too scary), but it is one of those films everyone has got to see. I first watched this film when it first came onto TV (they now repeat it every year), and I have been captivated by the imaginative story every single time I've seen it. The basic storyline is that two kids find an old board game, but when they start playing, the madness begins- stampeding animals and more! This is a story about friendship, love, sticking together and much, much more. If you haven't seen this film already WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!! Below average action adventure; I knew Jumanji was never going to burst with intelligence or be driven by great performances, and yet despite this I was quite looking forward to it as a holiday blockbuster. Well to put it in simple terms that was a mistake. The films plot stands a chance of being the most convoluted of the year with so many back stories it only ever annoys. It starts of with a young boy called Alan Parish who gets sucked into a board game, at this point I should have left as it only gets more idiotic. After this incident we flash forward twenty years to find two new children have found the game. They unleash Alan who is now grown up and played by an irritating Robin Williams. Along with him an assortment of Jungle beasties are unleashed into their quiet neighbourhood. The kids and Alan must complete the game to restore everything but with every throw of the dice more horrors await. The film resembles an ameturish pantomine in every respect a part from the visual effects. Director Joe Johnston also responsible for the mediocre Honey I shrunk the Kids should have treated the audience like adults, then the film might have gone somewere. However as the movie doesn't treat us like adults and depends totally on its special effects I think its safe to say its a failure. The performances particularly from the children and Robin Williams are predictable and annoying. Jumanji might entertain under 7's or those with IQ's under 50 but for the rest of us it simply is a heavily flawed and rather rubbish piece of cinema Early CGI Makes the Monkeys Look Fake! Otherwise It's Amazing!; An enchanted board game breaks into the real world and the only way out of it is to finish the game! The monkeys look \"washed-out\" and so do some of the wild zoo animals; which is why most of the rest of the EFX are mechanical or use backdrops and mattes. Otherwise a very strong 10 would be my vote, as the casting works and the plot shows lots of imagination and flair. With a \"sly wink\" to \"Peter Pan\", Alan's father plays both his dad and Van Pelt the Hunter. My two favorite scenes are when the house gets folded in half and eaten by the monstrous plant, and when everything swirls backwards into the gameboard. I also love it when the house goes \"wild\" and turns into a swamp complete with nasty alligators. I do not like the scene where the little boy turns into a monkey with a tail. Young children may find it disturbing like the donkey transformation in \"Pinocchio\". \"Jumanji\" is suspenseful and scary but no one actually dies in the film. Therefore, it's much more enjoyable when viewed again. The only one who seemed to hate it was Roger Ebert, but it's only too scary for pre-schoolers. Most \"users\" love it! What \"scares\" me the most in this film: the bats, insects, spiders, alligators, and The Hunter. The sequel will not have the charisma of the late and great Robin Williams. I still miss him. He was a comic genius. If there was a market for it, I would like it to be re-imagined with better graphics like the old \"Star Trek TOS\" reissue.  So you'll help us?; Robin Williams is incredible as Alan in this outstanding adventure movie. The supporting cast is phenomenal. The costumes are conservative. One of the good films in the genre, Jumanji will dare the viewer to play the game. 7 out of 10. 18 years of being a \"favourite\"; I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and \"Jumanji\" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie & it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life. Jumanji; I think that kids would like this movie better then grownups. I loved this movie but my mom thinks the plot is to low. The movie is based on the book Jumanji and is a lot more deeper then the book. My bother thought that the movie was corny and the special effects were so bad they were funny but what does he know? OK maybe the effects were bad but whatever. I mean the movie was made along time ago so give them a break. I thought the movie was really good and the acting was great. Its the kind of movie that if you like it you watch it again and again and again. When I was sick I saw it 4 times and I still thought it was good. All and all I would give this movie a 9. I think that kids would like to see it. The Disney movie that could have been; Hunt and Williams play the parts of shellshocked-delayed stress syndrome surviviors quite well. The story is entertaining and engrossing, with both elements of light and darkness. The effects-well, they DO look a bit unreal-and perhaps that is for the best-it adds a sense of unreality to the story -after all, these things come from a board-game universe! Even Van Pelt looks a bit CGI...and Bebe Nuewerth is a sweetie. Decent family entertainment; On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children. Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it. In the jungle you must wait....; In the jungle you must wait, until the dice reads five or eight. So professes a mysterious board game possessed by dark magic to young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd), a boy with no clue just how far an innocent roll of the dice can take you. From the first ominous drumbeat the game utters, until the last fading tones it plays the film out with, Jumanji is a giddy rush of pure adventure, with a refreshingly dark and primal side to its mayhem. Alan disappears from the 1950's and we fast forward 25 years later. Young orphans Peter and Judy (Kirsten Dunst & Bradley Pierce) are moving into his old family home, so fate (and those damn creepy drums) would have them find the Jumanji in the attic, and continue the game Alan started with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) over a decade ago. Suddenly every jungle creature, meteorological phenomenon and 90's CGI monster erupts from the game into their little town, causing a mess that goes beyond the word havoc. This includes a near feral middle aged Alan, now played by Robin Williams. Together with a most reluctant Sarah, the quartet try to stop the destruction, play the game, but mostly just survive this onslaught. Psychotic monkeys, mutant mosquitoes, an elephant stampede, monsoons, giant spiders (fucking shudder) and crocodiles are but a few of the wonders awaiting them. My favourite has to be murderous Victorian game hunter Van Pelt, played mightily by stage actor Jonathan Hyde, with a pith helmet and an epic mustache that would make Kurt Russell chortle. Hyde does excellent double duty as both the deranged hunter and Alan's stern but loving father, a tough contrast he handles like a champ. I admire the film's willingness to go creepy and dark, despite being geared towards kids. The danger feels real, the game has an eerie mysticism to it, a life of it's own that gives you goosebumps. Not often do family orientated films have a shred of real fear in them anymore, so let's count our blessings with this one, still holding strong today. The special effects are dated in places (those monkeys, man) and wonderful in others (that hardwood floor quicksand tho), but you have to cut them some slack, it being 1996 after all. Williams and Hunt have snarky banter that barely hides their love for each other, and it's one of my favourite on screen pairings he ever had with a gal. He makes Alan resourceful, kind and just a little bit crazy, but the guy did spend years alone in a treacherous jungle straight out of your nightmares, so that can be expected. Amidst the chaos you can look out for Patricia Clarkson, a deadpan Bebe Neurith and David Alan Grier as well. There's a lot of stuff crammed into the film, but never does it feel bloated or crippled by it's own weight, flowing nicely and taking time where it can to develop character and give it's human cast just as much to do as all the crazy jungle stuff. I'm surprised I never saw any of this go down as a kid, because parts of it were filmed blocks from my neighborhood, and CGI was scant back then, so much of it would have physically been there, large and loud. Maybe I did, and have since forgotten. I definitely haven't forgotten any of the film, though, and allow for repeated viewings whenever I have the time. It's one of the best, most thrilling adventure stories of its time and ages well as each year passes. Cue the drums. An enjoyable board game, so an enjoyable movie!; This is one of the movies that I really enjoy, even if I do not like comedy and fantasy that much, by the way I don't like Robin Williams either, he thinks he's a funny person, but he isn't, some of his movies like `Jack', `Good Will Hunting', and some others are quite bad. Most of his movies leave too much to be desired. He's just annoying, because it seems to me that he thinks that everybody who sees him will laugh at the ridiculous things he does, he enjoys making fun of the human body, women, men, etc. I dislike it enormously; however I must say that I really enjoyed this movie even though he was starring and the visual effects were obviously computerized. I was impressed by the originality of Jumanji. It's such an innovative, interesting and enjoyable movie. I liked it because the plot is extremely original, creative and gripping. Who on earth would be able to think of a game like Jumanji? An imaginative game in which journeys, action, fantasy, and perhaps a little bit of terror surpass all things. I like this movie because it teaches us to enjoy everyday to its fullest, we see that Alan Parker was a frustrated kid at the beginning of the movie, but after staying in the jungle until the dice read 5 or 8, he realized how worthy his life was. Also it teaches us to respect others, for instance we see the little boy who began to turn into a wolf after cheating on the game was crying and Alan who was a grown-up person then yelled at him, and made him feel bad, but after that he was sorry since he remembered the way his father yelled at him, so this is a valuable lesson, since it shows that parents must be patient and loving to their family, but sometimes love can be hazardous to them. `Jumanji' is a nice movie for all ages; it's a very risky, but enjoyable game, in which your life is at stake. The board game (Jumanji) was good looking, it was really mysterious and interesting, whoever saw it would love to play it. Overall the movie was a very good one, I enjoyed every minute and especially Kristin Dunst's performance who also played in \"Spiderman\", I also enjoyed Mr. Williams's performance, I'm glad he at last did something worth it. Anyway it was an enjoyable movie, but I'd have loved this if it had been more dramatic, terrifying, sad, etc. 8/10 Not board; Watched this on TV where it was aired as a tribute to the late Robin Williams. It's an enjoyable family-entertainment fantasy adventure with Williams playing a grown man who as a boy was sucked into a mysterious, dark board game called Jumanji, freed years later by a couple of young children who happen upon the game when they move into Williams's character by this time run-down house. Along with Williams also fully-grown girl friend of the time Kirsten Dunst, the four of them brave everything the game throws at them to finish it and free Williams to return to his old life. And does the game throw everything at them! Crazy monkeys, a roaring lion, a jungle which comes to life, hordes of stampeding elephants zebras and rhinos and one very persistent big game hunter. A veritable special effects fest, while the plot amounts to no more than awaiting the outcome of the next roll of the dice on the board, it all makes for good clean exciting fun and who amongst us as never enjoyed playing a board game as a child. The back stories about Williams being bullied as a child, having a fractious relationship with his dad and his adult wooing of Dunst are lightly drawn but all of course resolved happily ever after by the end. Williams is fine after he makes his delayed first appearance, portraying yet again a child trapped in a man's body just as he did in a line going back through Peter Pan in \"Hook\", \"Popeye\" all the way to his breakout part in \"Mork and Mindy\". Dunst offers good support and the kids aren't too gauche and sentimental either. Nice to see \"Cheers\" Bebe Neuwirth get a decent part too. I wouldn't call it Robin Williams defining role but as an update on the old children's matinée features, this was an entertaining feature made the better by Williams engaging performance. R.I.P. to him. Brings back a lot of memories. Still a good ride.; My Take: A terrific special effects-laden adventure. JUMANJI is among those films I strongly remember from my childhood. Along with JURASSIC PARK and its sequel, JUMANJI is among those films I enjoy watching multiple times just to see creatures wreck havoc on a crowded street, monsters crawl in from the dark and other bits of special effects extravaganza. I strongly remember the elephants and rhinos stampeding around the crowded streets, a giant man-eating flower with vine-like tentacles, those messy (and weakly done CGI) monkeys with antics borrowed from GREMLINS, the crocodile and the shot of the house breaking apart. What I didn't remember was how faulty the dramatic interludes were. Which is exactly the point. JUMANJI is a wildly entertaining special effects extravaganza that works much better that way. Director Joe Johnston, who revived old-fashioned pulp adventures with THE ROCKETEER and later made JURASSIC PARK III so much better than it might have been, is such an accomplished action director. JUMANJI is a terrific and highly entertaining, if sometimes perilous, family adventure, though it does make several rest stops for back-stories and a bit of drama which sacrifices the pacing. The movie opens with two kids in 1969 with two kids curiously playing the titular game board which eventually unleashes African bats in the fireplace and sucking in little Alan Parrish (then played by Adam Hann-Byrd) inside the game. Forward 26 years later, someone else has bought the old Parrish mansion and the two new kids (Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce) dig up the old board game in the dusty old attic and give the dice a little role, and all hell breaks loose in town. With a little help from an older Alan Parrish (now played by Robin Williams) and his now older best friend Sarah (delightfully played by Bonnie Hunt), they try to finish what they started, unleashing more special effects behemoth after another. That's just about the \"plot\" of JUMANJI, yet I can go on forever with its visual treats. While the CGI doesn't live up to today standards (not to mention the totally unconvincing CGI monkeys!), but some of them in particular (including the terrific sequences where elephants and rhinos rampage around town and inside the mansion living room) still are eye candy. And, courtesy of director Johnston, there are still well-orchestrated moments of excitement. Stars Hunt and co-star David Alan Grier as a cop having a bad day provide the laughs. Despite some dull moments, which have a very major thing to do with its weak writing department, JUMANJI is still an amiable piece of entertainment. Still worth a look, but you might have the options of fast-forwarding to the really good parts. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5. Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... All sorts of things; As a child Williams is \"captured\" by bizarre jungle survival board game.  He emerges 26 years later when the game is next played by two orphans.  Williams and Hunt give it their best and a young Dunst is effective, while the movie itself is alternately poignant, absurd, mildly if broadly humorous, and very uncomfortable.  If you've bought into the premise and can follow it through the finale is very satisfying. The graphics were superb; This movie was a real hit in our family. The action was intense all the way through. You didn't know what to expect. It was so good I ended up buying it on tape. I recommend anyone reading this should do the same. Think of it as Night At The Museum meets a board game; Jumanji is based off a cartoon TV series that was made into a film in 1995 and stars funnyman Robin Williams who plays a man called Alan Parrish who as a kid played a board game called Jumanji which was been buried since 1869 with his friend Sarah(Bonnie Hunt)in the year 1969.But when Alan plays the game he gets sucked into it as his friend Sarah watched in horror as each time the player plays the game consequences occur and the only way to finish the game is to play the whole thing. Fast forward 26 years later in 1995 and two young children played by Kirsten Dunst (from the Spider-Man franchise)and Bradley Pierce who's parents died along time ago are now living with their aunt as their aunt bought Alan's old house.But when the two kids stumble across the board game as they hear the drums playing in the background in the attic,its up to them to try and finish off where the player left off and free Alan who helps them finish the game with his friend Sarah. But will they finish the game. Overall this film is really good until the very end which was sorta confusing for me. If you seen it you know what it is but it involves time travelling back to 1969 and then back to 1995 again. But still if you are a fan of Fantasy movies,Robin Williams and if you love something to keep you entertained on a lazy Sunday afternoon Jumanji is worth checking out. A lovely little film; This four year-old film, I would highly recommend for anyone out there in fantasy-land. Nice special effects, a very good idea behind the plot and Robin Williams all ensure a thoroughly enjoyable experience if you like action-comedies without the ubiquitous \"Good vs. Bad\" show-down. Jumanji is very different and well worth seeing. I look forward to the upcoming Jumanji 2 next year;  the cast for Jumanji 2 probably needs to include Gerard Depardieu instead of Robin Williams!!!! :-) A little adventurous... and childish.; Jumanji is a great idea.  The movie has great potential and could have turned out excellent and a true action classic. However, some aspects of the movie prevent that.  For example, the monkeys in the kitchen and abroad hardly look like monkeys.  They look like warped, evil, demonic beings with fur and tails that were only made to cause mischief.  Well, sure, you might say that's what the game meant to do, but come on... I think they should have used real monkeys here. Certain parts of the dialogue are a little corny and make one feel as though we're watching \"Spy Kids\", which can sometimes really ruin the feel that they're in a life-or-death situation. The acting was great (some parts it was not), and as usual, Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst put on an above-average performance. The action and crashes and other sequences are a contradiction, in a way.  Here we have fake-looking monkeys, but superbly crafted action. The music, composed by James Horner, is quite dull and does not help get you into the spirit of the movie.  A lower-than-average job on his part. Overall, this movie is really good.  I would suggest watching it if you can get past some annoying areas of the movie. My Childhood; This movie made my childhood. I love Robin Williams movies, Jumanji introduced him to me. Jumanji is a movie that everyone should watch. Robin Williams will again make you appreciate living as he always does in his movies. The movie contains full of fantasy objects. The writer has a really great imagination. I will make my children to watch this movie after all years that pass. While watching this movie as a kid, I was scared, excited and happy. It makes you to feel every kind of feeling. This indicates that the movie has done a good job. I again recommend to everyone. Jumanji appeals for all ages. I am pretty sure I will watch the movie again when I get old with the same emotions when I watched it in the first time. Action and adventure for the kids, and Robin Williams for the adults; Find a comfortable chair, lay out the board, grab the dice, and get ready to play.  But remember:  once you start this game, you can't stop.  If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must. \"Jumanji\" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  The basic premise stays the same:  a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure.  When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things.  Only finishing the game will make it all go away. In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added.  Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself.  He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing.  The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams!  Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter. Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles.  He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt.  The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the \"This is MY baby\" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike. Parrish House's Plans; Hi there! I would really appreciate if you can help me with this. I really love that movie, cause of the old Parrish House. I am planning to build my own house by the end of this year and the model that I have in mind is Jumanji's Parrish House. Of course, watching the movie any architect could design the exterior facade, but it has been really hard to find the floor pans. Does anyone have idea of a web page or any source where I could find the floor plans? In advance I thank you for your help. Kind regards, Ralph A great movie; JUMANJI I loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today! The movie is about a boy who finds a board game called Jumanji. When he takes it home and starts to play it with a friend, he soon realises that this is no ordinary game. He gets sucked into the game and is not released again until 26 years later 2 more kids find the game and release him. Now he is grown up and has to find a way to end this game before everything it releases destroys the town. Due to the sad passing of the genius that was Robin Williams, the TV channels have decided to show all of his movies. Jumanji was the first one I saw. The story to this film is like not her that I had seen before. It was an original idea (unless there is another film I don't know about) that was just so imaginative. It works really well and has a great adventure element about it. The effects are average. This was made in the mid 90s so that probably has something to do with it. The animals were obviously not real. You could see the lion was so mechanical it made me laugh. And the other animals were so obviously computer generated. But it was comical and that just added to the fun of the film. The acting was great. The main character was played by Robin Williams. He was as energetic and full of character in this role, just like he brought to every role he took. Other cast members were Jonathan Hyde, a young Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bonnie Hunt. Bonnie Hunt was brilliant. Her reaction and facial expressions made me laugh a few times in this. Another stand out performance was by David Alan Grier. David was so funny as the cop. His comedy timing was excellent and deserves a mention. This film really does keep you entertained throughout and is just a lot of fun to watch... Even now nearly 20 years later. I will give this 7 out of 10. Normally I end my reviews with a quote from the movie, but this time I just want to say how gutted I am about the news of Robins death. I am a fan of his work. I watched Mork and Mindy when I was a kid and grew up watching Jumanji, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam, Jack etc... There were so many great films that he made. I always saw Robin as so full of energy and full of life. He had one of the greatest smiles in Hollywood and when i saw an interview with him, he seemed so chirpy and happy. It just shows that in front of the camera, you never know what is going on in people's heads. I was sad to hear he had been suffering from depression. Depression is such a deadly illness. I know this sounds stupid, but I am gutted that I was not there to talk to him, help him. I hate to think that he felt so alone, especially as he had millions of fans all over the world that knew him on screen. He made the world laugh out loud so many times. Even through bad times in my life, watching his movies has put a smile on my face. Robin deserved much more happiness than he got. He gave so much to me and the rest of the world and it doesn't seem right that he should end his life this way. I will miss seeing new movies from him, but will always continue to go back to enjoy his old ones. Robin will live on in my house and he will always continue to make me smile. R.I.P. Robin Williams. Built around special effects that haven't aged well; I remember watching this film as a kid and loving it, but revisiting it now is like watching a different film. 'Jumanji' has lost its magic. It came across much better a few years ago, when CGI and special effects weren't as common as they are today. Unfortunately, with the film being so special effect oriented, it hasn't aged well. The effects are dated now and just don't have the same impact as they used to. Having said that, this is still a moderately entertaining film with an interesting and original plot, based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsburg. Robin Williams is excellent as Alan, as you would expect. I enjoyed this film a lot more a few years ago, but it hasn't aged well and has lost its magic. A breathless unforgettable adventure!; I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind... This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure. Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story. Great! 10 out of 10 from me! Excellent!; There is only one way to describe Jumanji: excellent. The plot is very, original, with outstanding concepts packed into each individual scene. After viewing this movie, the wild side of the jungle gets into you, making you want to dare to play the game. Although the computer animation may not look all that real, I still give this movie a 10/10, for an outstanding plot, casting, and spirit, which any great movie has. Entertaining...but one major problem; Jumanji is an entertaining movie. I'm surprised its IMDB \"User Rating\" is only 5.9. I would give it a 7. However, I don't understand why the kids (and Robin Williams) keep playing the game. With every roll of the dice, they put their lives in more jeopardy...along with the lives of everyone in the city. They could have stopped anytime after the bats or the mosquitoes or the monkeys or the lion. But they kept going (under the guise of \"finishing the game is the only way to make everything return to normal\"). I kept yelling at the screen, \"Stop playing Jumanji and you'll be okay.\" Of course, if they had stopped playing the game, then there's no movie. Good fantasy movie...; Well the Jumanji is just a great movie which shows how life is filled with luck and chances... The concept of game of dice is so good and the movie will be a bit of thriller too because we will be curious what may come next when they roll the dice each time.... Williams did his Alan character well, i almost felt like crying when Alan came to know that his family is no more.... The only backdrop of the movie is the monkey. It seems so unusual..... Overall, a good movie everyone could watch....:) Enjoy... :) Game Over, Man; Spoilers herein. The reason this film was made was because they could do the effects. That reason has no power now, and in fact most of them already look a bit cheezy. But there are some interesting elements: --Kirstin Dunst at her peak. --Robin Williams in his best role. Or rather for the role best suited to a manic comic. --A pretty cool house, one of the best in recent memory. --Some clever time folding. --A screenwriter's wet dream: in addition to creating a film world that sucks in viewer into an artificial reality, to have that film world contain another one. That world-within-the world is exactly as far from the normal world of the film as it is from us. Just like the film, it grabs us once we start and won't let go until the end. Clever idea. Not exploited. Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements. I love this movie so much; If you do not love this movie you are crazy. Its filled with action and excitement. I love Sarah Whittle played by the famous Bonnie Hunt. I also like Carl Bentley, a clueless police officer played by the comedian David Alan Grier. This movie is so creative. My sister and I watch the movie every weekend, we do not get tired of it. This movie did not get the awesome rating it deserved. People sometimes do not understand a quality move when they see one. I would strongly, strongly, strongly recommend the movie. Trust me you will love it to death. If you do not... then you are odd.

It stars Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Jonathan Hyde. The story is about a weird board game that when played unleashes hazards from the jungle with every throw of the dice. Once you have started playing you have to finish the game for normality to be resumed. Simple in plot and coming off as an excuse to show off some impressive effects-said the critics- Jumanji defied the critics of the time to become a box office winner and a family favourite. Enough of a favourite to spawn a sequel (Zathura 2005) , an animated TV series and a board game. In truth the film is reliant on its effects to entertain, with the cast (all competent and enjoyable) merely lurching from one perilous throw of the dice to another. But to call the film shallow is wrong and ignorant. There's flecks of bad parenting, peer pressure, grief and bullying, while the impact of a missing child on one town is a noteworthy addition to the story line. You wonder if those critics actually paid attention during their free viewings?. Yes it's berserker family fun, but it's not without worth in the writing too. Besides which, for the action set pieces and the laughs-they alone mean the film has its merits. 7/10 Entertaining family/adventure/fantasy; Released in 1995, \"Jumanji\" is fun movie about a mystical board game from the 1800s, which is found in 1969 leading to the mysterious disappearance of a rich boy. The game is discovered again in 1995 by two orphans (Jonathan Hyde and Kirsten Dunst) who play the game and bring back the lost boy now an adult (Robin Williams). The only way they can stop the havoc the game causes is to finish it. Bonnie Hunt, David Alan Grier and Bebe Neuwirth are also on hand. Patricia Clarkson has a small role. \"Jumanji\" is a great example of the way youth adventures should be done. It's entertaining from beginning to end for children, teens and adults. If you've lost sight of your inner-kid give \"Jumanji\" a try. What makes it worthwhile for adults, besides simply being fun, is that it contains compelling themes and everything ties-up for a moving climax. Plus Bebe Neuwrith looks great (she played Frasier's psychologist babe on Cheers). The movie runs 104 minutes and was shot in Maine, New Hampshire and the Vancouver, British Columbia, area. GRADE: B+ a game not like the other ones; \"Jumanji\" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game \"jumanji\" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy. Epitome of Moronic Hollywood Film-Making; A previous reviewer wrote: \"A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie.\" I agree in part and disagree in part with that comment. The problem is impossible to pinpoint, because there are PLENTY of \"big problems\" with this movie! \"Random hazard generator\" is the PERFECT description of the ancient board game! Random hazard after random hazard until the game ends is what is supposed to pass for \"plot\" in this movie. Did anybody count how many times the game board fell out of and back into the players' hands? That, too is supposed to pass for tension. Ultimately, the film fails because there isn't any development of the back story. What was the origin of the game? Now, that would have been an interesting question to explore! And how does the game work? All we ever see is the game's projection of \"random hazards\" OUTWARD into the reality of the players, but somehow Alan (Robin Williams) apparently was sucked INTO the game. How did that happen, and why doesn't it happen to any of the current players of the game? Actually, the guy in the pith helmet is, more or less, the human villain in this movie, but he is never more than an inexplicable, evil cartoon. Was he, too sucked into the game like Alan, or is he the sole human \"random hazard\" generated by the game? Why is he so determined, not to hunt animals, but to MURDER Alan? The film just glosses over the fact that this sub-plot is actually one of premeditated murder! The hunter guns for Alan simply because the plot demands it. But the movie makes no attempt whatever to explain the character. Never once did I sense any genuine emotional chemistry among the characters. Just a bunch of actors acting - not INTERACTING. The love story sub-plot felt obligatory, never genuine. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt never generated enough chemistry to make me care whether Alan and Sarah got together in the predictable end. All in all, this film has the germ of an interesting idea that is really wasted by focusing on mindless, non-stop \"random hazards,\" poor CGI effects, \"lots of screaming and running around\" and insufficient character development. Except for the precise nature of each \"random hazard,\" the whole film was disappointingly predictable, including the cliché of the almost-kiss in the midst of peril routine. How many zillion times has that been used? The dialog is a similarly endless stream of clichés. The issue was never HOW the game would end - but WHEN. The more interesting issues were never even glanced at. This kind of movie can only appeal to people raised on video games. It was generated by that kind of adventure-for-the-sake-of-adventure mentality, and it has that same kind of feel. This rocks!; Jumanji rocks! The effect of everything is awesome. If Jumanji 2 ever comes out it better be good cause it would be a put down if it was terrible. Robin Williams is a great actor! You could have not picked a better person for the part of Allen. The jungle; This is an excellent movie for all ages. Congratulations to the cast, production, stunts and all the people. And now I want know what's happen in the jungle when Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) was there for 26 years. This should be a good adventure. pretty good, except...; Jumanji is an enjoyable, and at times exciting family adventure. Only one major flaw: the special effects. Jumanji relies on special effects for impact. Nothing wrong with that, only its so easy to tell that they are special effects. Enough fun to get you to sit through it, but they should really find another effects crew next time. 2/4 Exciting Family Adventure; In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called \"Jumanji\", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished. Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human. The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like \"Dead Poet's Society\" or \"Good Morning, Vietnam\"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality. This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor. Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the \"Narnia\" stories). Fortunately, any moralising in \"Jumanji\" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of \"alternative timelines\". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10 Probably not perfect, but very fun; Jumanji is a highly imaginative and very fun movie. The visuals are good, and the story is creative and exciting. The storyline consists of a man being sucked into a board game. 26 years later, two kids find the board game and set him free. However, the game board has already released a few dangers, and those dangers must be stopped. The only way to do that is to finish the board game, and the animals (or whatever else was released from the game) will be put back into the game. There is action and minor thrills, and the movie emerges as being a fun experience. It's kind of creative, and it's an excellent adventure film. Sure, it is a bit cliché'd and the monkeys look pretty corny, but don't let them distract you from the overall enjoyment of the movie. 6.5/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment. An entertaining, chaotic adventure, one which impressed me as a kid and still does now; I first heard of this successful family adventure movie at school in the late primary grades. It must have been new to the VHS format at the time (meaning I missed its successful theatrical run), and a student in my class brought a copy in for show and tell. I think I was interested in seeing it for months before I finally did. I remember watching it more than once on video in the summer of 1996. After those months of anticipation, I don't think I was let down, even if it did seem weird and scary the first time, with all the chaos. I guess I wasn't used to seeing that in films at the time. I've watched it again twice in recent years, after growing up, and both times, I found that it was still entertaining, unlike some movies I enjoyed in my childhood. In 1969, Alan Parrish is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Brantford, New Hampshire, with an upper class family. One day, after being ambushed by a group of bullies, he hears a mysterious sound of drums coming from a construction site! At the site, he digs up a box, where the sound is coming from, a box which was buried there 100 years earlier! Inside, he finds a board game called Jumanji, and takes it home. When Alan is at home by himself after a falling out with his father, his friend, Sarah Whittle, comes over, and he shows her the game. They begin to play it, not realizing how powerful and dangerous it is! Alan is sucked inside, and Sarah is chased off by bats that come out of the game! 26 years later, two kids, Judy and Peter Shepherd, whose parents have died, move into the old Parrish house with their aunt Nora. The siblings hear the drumming of Jumanji from up in the attic, and find the game. They start playing the game without a clue, just like Alan and Sarah did, and dangerous animals begin to come out of it! Also, Alan is finally released after being trapped in the jungle for 26 years! He learns that the year is 1995, and sadly, his parents have passed away. He must now continue the game with Judy and Peter, and reunite with Sarah. The four of them are all players now, and they must finish the game if things are ever going to go back to normal, which will obviously be very risky! The film starts well with the spooky 1869 sequence, when the box is buried out in the dark. After that, it's usually pretty good around the beginning. During the first of my two latest viewings, I remember finding most of the movie dull before Robin Williams comes in, but with my last viewing, I didn't find that to be the case. There isn't much humour during this part of this film, but there is some suspense. When Williams does make his boisterous entry, that's when the humour starts. After that, there's both excitement, with all the action and chaos, and humour. Williams provides laughs with his antics, but the film doesn't rely entirely on him for the humour. Sarah's reluctance to continue the game in 1995, the scene with Van Pelt, the trigger happy hunter from the game in a gun shop, and Aunt Nora and Officer Carl Bentley witnessing some of the Jumanji animals are also funny. Other merits of \"Jumanji\" include some poignant moments, good CGI effects (even if they're not the best, and have been topped since then), and decent acting, which includes decent child actors, unlike some films. All these things are what I think makes this film good family entertainment. really fun movie , Robin Williams excellent as always; Jumanji like Ghost , I surprised myself with the note in Metascore , very low, only 39 ?, the film is very fun , obviously in terms of the film script is weak , plus the cast is good, great Robin Williams as always Kristen Dunst young , and also participation as a police officer David Alan Grier , and his scenes are funny, the special effects at the time are acceptable , plus some people may not like , since the film is not as present (one of the big reasons because I support the remake will have Dwayne Johnson , Kevin Hart and Jack Black) , has good fun characters , some are boring , have really nice moments , and the end of the film hinted that would have a continuation , Jumanji is a good movie , is an excellent pass time , where we see Robin Williams do what do best , take the viewer smiles . Note 7.5 A walk in the memory lane; We (me and my brother) used to watch a cartoon named \"Jumanzi\" every Wednesday, back in 2000. Watching this movie talk me through a walk in my memory lane. The great Robin Williams also makes me nostalgic. 26 years, struggling and surviving, and than fighting back to get their life back. It is called human spirit. Though, every bit of it is fantasy, the plot become more human, when Robin remembered his saviors, who give him another chance in the game. A fairly lively jungle jaunt.; I think when Jumanji was released ten years ago, it was probably an attempt to cash in on the recent success of Jurassic Park. Both films have similar ideas. Using CGI effects to bring all manner of creatures to life. Although not quite as successful as JP, I still found Jumanji an exciting film. Beginning in 1869, in the town of Brantford, New Hampshire, two boys are hurriedly trying to bury something in the woods. This certain something doesn't take kindly to it, and protests in the form of jungle drums. Just before they leave, they pray for the poor soul who should ever find it. We cut to 1969, when young boy Alan Parrish is drawn to a construction site by the mysterious sound of jungle drums. It leads him to a chest. When he opens it, he finds a board game, JUMANJI. Alan has no way to know he is about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime! Showing the game to his best friend Sarah, they become enthralled in the game's seemingly magical powers. It's pieces move by themselves. Words appear in a crystal at the centre. And things have a tendency to come out of it when they roll the dice. Things take a nasty turn when after Alan rolls a 5, the game pulls him into it, where he remains trapped for 26 years. A new family move into Alan's home, Judy (Kirsten Dunst), Peter, and their aunt Nora (a woefully underused Bebe Neuwirth). The game calls to them as it did Alan and Sarah, and they end up releasing giant mosquitoes, a group of mischievous monkeys, a ferocious lion, and a fully grown Alan Parrish (Robin Williams). Alan barely has time to register how much time has passed when he realises there are more rules to JUMANJI then he thought. Everything that has come out of the game so far will stay in our world until a player reaches the end. But getting to the end is easier said than done. The more moves they make, the more dangerous things come out of the game. Reuniting with an adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), our foursome must tackle JUMANJI'S dangers and finish the game once and for all. Although there's not much to Jumanji plot-wise (a trait it shares with Jurassic Park), there are enough thrills and spills going on you'll barely have time to notice. No sooner have our heroes survived one deadly encounter, the film throws in another. That type of dynamic is really what drives the film, and there are times where Jumanji feels repetitive. But it has a decent cast to carry things along nicely. Robin Williams plays it relatively straight, but then I usually prefer his more dramatic roles to his larger than life ones, so it didn't bother me. And compared to most of the sugary shite he was churning out during this period, Jumanji was a nice change of pace. Bonnie Hunt adds some of her own comic touch, who's been left a nervous wreck after witnessing what happened to Alan as a child. The children are not that bad either. That's one thing I like about Joe Johnston's films. The children in his films actually have a shred of dignity to their characters, and are not nearly as precocious as they might have been in the hands of a less able director. Jumanji is certainly imaginative. We get quite a menagerie of creatures on display. Stampeding elephants and rhinos. Giant spiders. Man-eating plants and vines. This could all be a mite too scary for younger kids. But I first saw Jumanji at the age of 12, and I loved it. There are nice touches of humour throughout that help offset the scarier scenes. And there's a funny running gag about a policeman's car that gets slowly wrecked by the different things coming out of the game. Unfortunately, when it comes to the CGI, the effects are nowhere near as dazzling as Jurassic Park's dinosaurs. The filmmakers just haven't got the hang of using CGI. The monkeys especially look fake. And some of the animatronics could have been handled better. Those spiders are very jerky when they move. But the film more than makes up for its shortcomings in the action scenes. Joe Johnston seems to get a certain glee watching his CGI creations running rampant destroying everything, in much the same way Joe Dante did in Gremlins. It's certainly not a boring film. The indoor monsoon is my favourite part, where Alan has to wrestle a crocodile! It's fairly inventive too, when Alan nearly gets swallowed up after the floor turns to quicksand. And the earthquake. Brilliant! If you can simply switch your brain to autopilot and try not to think too much, you'll be in for a fun ride. Overall, Jumanji may be a bit shallow, but you'll find it difficult not to get sucked in.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             very funny.; This film has some of the funniest lines and it's a great comedy. One would probably think, even I, thought that this would probably happen between two older men who fight about the obvious: women, fish and each other. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are a perfect pair. Even though it's a comedy, the romance in it is on the clean side. Nothing too distasteful and the comic relief is still included into the romance, which gives it a continuous comic flow. Even though there is a serious part of the film where John's father passes away, after that scene the film is back to the comic feel, which is nice because there's no dwelling on the sad/serious scene. Nonetheless, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh hard. Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. Is it better than original?; Is this movie better than the original? Perhaps. It's probably funnier than the original. Walter Matthau's pick-up line is one of the funniest things of the movie. But is it better than the original? The original had more of the emotions of Lemmon and Matthau as they fought. This one has less feuding (but still has some of the old pranks) and more focus on the family / dating relationships of the old men. This movie is funny and definitely worth watching. You'll have to decide on your own if it's better than the original. Back For More!; CONTAINS SPOILERS John Gustafson and Max Goldman are back in their first adventure since their last. It's six months later and they're still fishing. All the snow has melted and the neighborhood looks very different. The boys are out to catch a giant legendary fish they've heard tell about.          These men would soon discover big changes happening. Like, their friend Chuck, who died in the last adventure, had operated the bait shop. Ever since his demise, it's been empty, but some people have come with plans to turn it into a ristorante (restaurant). They are: Mama Regetti and daughter Maria. John and Max don't want that to happen so they pull numerous pranks on the Regettis but they still won't leave.         Jacob Goldman and Melanie Gustafson contemplate matrimony. But have their doubts when their fathers insist on planning the event. But when the kids decide the wedding is off, John and Max are back at it. Pulling all sorts of foolish pranks on one another. Max steals John's outboard motor, John wrecks Max's fish net and has his cat scratch up Max's car seats, but Max sends a big dog through John's house. Ariel decides to leave for a while. John was in a real pickle. He tried asking his father for advice, but he had passed away; Max goes on a date with Maria and they decide they like one another.        Pretty soon, it's a wedding day. En route to the church, Max and John decide to fish for the giant musket they're so fond of. They catch it, but John says they must leave it in the lake out of respect for his father, so they do and rush to church. It looks like the wedding of Jacob and Melanie, but it isn't. They eloped. It's the wedding of Max and Maria. John planted Max's dog in the limo as they drive off.        Was this as good as the first? Sure. I'm sorry to say that the three main stars, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith are no longer with us. Meredith died in 1998, Matthau in 2000 and Lemmon in 2001, which is real sad. So it's guarenteed there will never be an Even Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple III. They were really funny men. Why do the good ones always gotta die? But anyway, if you're a fan of these men and you enjoyed the first one, then I recommend Grumpier Old Men! - Delightful acting and script but silly scenes...; Always delighting in Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, warmed by their aging and childish pranks, I enjoyed this film which is filled with delightful acting and fun script.It suffers, however,  from more than a few silly scenes. Funnier than the first!; This movie is downright hilarious with tons of good one-liners. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (may they both rest in peace) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max & John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says \"Holy moly\" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor! Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. One of the best movies of 1995!; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. 7/10 stars. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Grumpy, but not funny; What, I wonder, does the legendary Billy Wilder think of this film starring Lemmon and Matthau, the great team he so memorably paired in 1966's \"The Fortune Cookie\"?  Wilder's film is a dark, cynical satire, and was the first of what is now seven films starring the pair.  Seven films, but only two of them--\"The Fortune Cookie\" and \"The Odd Couple\"--are genuinely funny efforts showcasing these actors' combined talents.  \"Grumpy Old Men\" was mildly amusing due less to the script than to the welcome return of Lemmon and Matthau who hadn't been on screen together in 12 years.  The unexpected box-office bonanza naturally inspired a sequel, but all this equally lucrative outing has in its favor is a brief monologue by Burgess Meredith who, as Lemmon's 95-year-old father, boasts of eating bacon and smoking Camels while the \"experts\" who warned against such vices are taking a \"dirt nap.\"  Not even Lemmon and Matthau can enliven the script by Mark Steven Johnson this time around.  The curmudgeonly Matthau admitted he didn't lke the script for the first film but did it to work with Lemmon, and that the only reason he did the sequel is because the first film was a hit.  No doubt, \"Grumpiest Old Men,\" the inevitable sequel, will be just as dreary. If these pictures make big bucks, why tamper with the formula?  Why hire Billy Wilder to punch up the quality when the public seems content merely to see Lemmon and Matthau rather than see them at their best? \"Good Lemmon & Matthau Comedy Sequel!\"; Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Kevin Pollack, Daryl Hannah and Burgess Meredith star in this 1995 comedy sequel. This takes place about 6 months later where John (Lemmon) is now married to Ariel (Margret) and he and Max (Matthau) are sort of getting along. This time, Max finds romance when he meets Maria Ragetti (Loren), an Italian widow who moves into town and opens a restaurant. Jacob (Pollack) and Melanie (Hannah) are also engaged and things start to get a bit difficult for them which makes their dads feud with each other, but only temporarily. The late, Meredith (Rocky) also returns as John's father and this was his final film. This is a good sequel and like the first film, it provides laughs and a bit of heartfelt moments as well. I recommend this. It has it's moments; Howard Deutch decided he wanted to cash in on the success of Grumpy Old Men and it worked. The only problem to the sequel is that some of the cast seem to be a bit bored by the proceedings. The one liners are enough to make you drop your popcorn. Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon are a joy to watch as they continue to find ways to drive each other over the edge into insanity. And yet Deutch calms that insanity by giving us a quick glimpse into just how much these two men mean to each other when Jack's dad played by Burgess Meredith dies. Lemmon and Mathau are still at the top of their game in this film. In this film the Ann Margaret character is suppose to be the rock, the sound of reason, the calm in the midst of the storm. You believe she is until she has the insanity thrust upon her and is forced to react. For the most part Ann Margaret as well as Daryl Hannah seem bored throughout the entire film. Kevin Pollack is just as good in this sequel as in the original. Burgess Meredith is the scene stealer, he manages with dead pan accuracy to deliver some of the best one liners in the film. Ann Morgan Guilbert manages to match Burgess with her ability to respond to his one liners with shock and outrage befitting her character. And then you come to Sophia. Sophia is in her comfort zone here. Sophia is comfortable with the slapstick comedy and relishes it, she's in the movie, she's not walking through it. She's absolutely stunning to watch but at the same time she adds to the moment. She's as glamorous as ever but it doesn't get in the way. All in all a good follow up to the original. A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances...; A sequel to the thoroughly enjoyable Grumpy Old Men, 'Grumpier Old Men' is A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances. The sequel has the spirit of its prequel & the amazing cast, led by the impeccable talents of the Late/Great Jack Lemmon & the Late/Great Walter Matthau, are in full form! 'Grumpier Old Men' Synopsis: John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. 'Grumpier Old Men' works well as a romantic-comedy, as it has moments of humour & subtle romance. I loved the prequel & I must say, the sequel doesn't fail to deliver. The film has sustained its energy & wit, that one would expect from it. Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is entertaining, although initially the pace is slightly slow. Howard Deutch's Direction is top-class. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is good. Editing also is ably done. Performance-Wise: Lemmon & Matthau shine all through. Its their sheer on-screen chemistry, that alone is worth watching the entire film. Sophia Loren is top-notch. Ann-Margret is impressive. Kevin Pollak & Daryl Hannah leave a mark. Late/Great Burgess Meredith is memorable in his part. On the whole, 'Grumpier Old Men' is a smooth, relaxing watch. forget the fussing; As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Sweet and Sad; In this bright sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\" we find John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) at it again. The rivalry never stops. This time, they are bickering over their children's nuptials, almost causing a wedding not to occur. Sophia Loren co-stars as Maria in this foray into the land of 10,000 lakes as the new girl in town that Max has an eye for. At first, they both hate one another because she is turning his beloved tackle shop into a restaurant. Comedy ensues as Max and John both try to get the restaurant shut down and condemned. Eventually, as in the first film, love finds a way. However, sadness veils over as well when Burgess Meredith's character dies. Other than that, the film is very enjoyable. great; This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in 1995, 2 years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie 8 out of 10. Grumpier Old Men Too Sedate *; While Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were an excellent team, they bombed in this film but good. What's so grumpy about Lemmon in this film? The prequel was much better. Ann Guilbert, as Sophia Loren's mother, is given little to do. Remember her as the grandmother to \"The Nanny?\" Sophia Loren, other than marrying Matthau, is also give nothing to do. Ditto for Ann-Margret, Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak, all of whom were so good in the original but are reduced to practically nothing here. I also resent Matthau, who shows off his part-Jewish heritage marrying in a church at the end. I found this to be offensive. Sorry, but that's the way I am-old fashioned. To all those criticize me for the last statement, how would you have felt if the Matthau-Loren nuptials had taken place in a synagogue? While I realize that this was a comedy, this still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. A non-religious setting would have been the only solution to this. Sophia, twenty years later at 80, is still spectacular.; I saw a picture of Sophia on her eightieth birthday, demurely covering herself with a sheet and a heart-melting smile. All I could think of was the scene where she hitched up her bra and marched through the bar, and every man looked, and I do mean every man. I read later that she had \"improved\" the script for that. A reviewer in the SF Chronicle wrote later that she said she had had no \"touch- ups\", and if so then \"her genes need investigating.\" I remember her many films where her beauty was so natural that it was a wonder any man could concentrate on his lines. She never traded on it, but on her talent as an actress. Carlo Ponti was a lucky man: beauty without guile, talent without pretense. Italian pizza were like street food. When she heard we had so many pizza parlors, she thought we must be a poor country. Then she visited, and dined on American pizza. She reconsidered, gracefully and graciously. The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from 1995. The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe 8yrs old, and must have seen it over 100 x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it 15 minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. charming and funny light romantic comedy; It may be just me but I found Grumpier Old Men way way better than Grumpy Old Men. I laughed more and got involved in the plot much more. That it is totally 100% predictable every step of the way is only one of its charms... its how you get there where the fun is. And these actors turn in surprisingly memorable performances for such a slight film. I thought Sophia Loren turned in one of her most charming and funny performances, as did everyone else. The story was just more interesting and three dimensional than the first film and flowed more organically. The story line is simple ancient classic romantic comedy that these veterans had done so many times, it seemed for them like doing a well-known dance. The fun is not in surprises but in going through the old steps with joy. The actors move through their paces with simplicity and enthusiasm and the film actually captures very well the effects of love. The whole film hangs together and works in a way that, for me, the first one didn't. It gets airborne. It deserves a higher ranking than my seven except the story is a little too well-worn. It also allows the two protagonists to get a little more real with each other. Even the three charismatic animal actors get caught up in the spirit of fun. One thing about the film that gave me trouble was that all four women being courted in the film are talented, accomplished, strong and magnificent while all four of the men are hamstrung. I found it mysterious that these women, dropped by some miracle into this tiny town, would be so strongly attracted. Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. Mini Ha Has In Minnesota; It's just possible that the intention was to shoot four Grumpy Old Men titles featuring the four seasons because after the Winter setting of the first one we are now in Summer though theoretically such a cycle should have begun with Spring and ended with Winter so maybe the cyclical thing was an afterthought. Whatever we have virtually the same cast doing virtually the same thing with one absentee and two replacements one of which, Anna Guilbert is actually a native of Minneapolis adding a touch of authenticity. If it was unrealistic that Ann Margaret - who, after all, was teaching English at university and would by definition have access to dozens of eligible males - would marry Jack Lemmon in the first film it is equally unrealistic that Sophia Loren would wed Walter Mattheau here other than for feelgood reasons. On the other hand it's probably churlish to nitpick in this way when the film is only intended to entertain. Which it does. the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. The good, the bad, and the just plain miserable...again; It's not uncommon for a movie sequel to do little to the formula that made its predecessor so financially (and hopefully critically) successful. The old \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" method of filmmaking has been used in the Hangover, Home Alone, and Taken franchise to only modest success in terms of quality. However, in Grumpier Old Men, the sequel to the fine comedy Grumpy Old Men, handles the rehashed formula better than many film sequels do. While I'm getting to sound repetitive and out of descriptive words, this is largely because of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's chemistry together on-screen. From the moment they appear, it's almost impossible to believe the men's friendship in real life wasn't lifelong and consisted largely of playful torment, vulgarity, and several boys nights out. Had the film been a sequel with few returning cast members (say Lemmon and Matthau were substituted by two other actors), this sequel would've likely been a somber affair to view. In a way, I'm thankful the town of Wabasha Minnesota hasn't really changed much since our last outing, with the exception of John Gustafson (Jack Lemon) marrying Ariel (Ann-Margret) from the original film. In the meantime, John's dad still lives off a diet of beer, cigarettes, and bacon and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), John's cantankerous neighbor, still finds himself engaging in petty neighborhood battles with John about outwitting the other man. However, the big ordeal this time is not competing for a new neighbor's love but trying to save a local bait shop from becoming a \"restaurante\" for Italian cuisine. The restaurant is managed by Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren), a gorgeous but uncompromisingly strict woman who catches the eye of Max even as him and Jack plan to foil the restaurant's forthcoming prosperity. Other events (aka subplots) occurring in Wabasha are the wedding between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah), a plot which would later be used by the same director Howard Deutch in The Odd Couple II, also starring Lemmon and Matthau, along with John trying to get his father (Burgess Meredith in his final role, which was burdened by spouts with Alzheimer's and difficultly remembering lines, some female company as he gets older. One of Grumpier Old Men's immediate issues is that there is simply too much going on between plot-strands that involve marriage/romance troubles (I counted four including John's brief trouble with Ariel later in the movie) ad others that involve trying to sabotage the bait-shop-turned-restaurant. Grumpier Old Men may have too many new ideas for cutesy subplots, but it keeps the tone and feel of its predecessor alive and well. It still feels like Wabasha is the location of a sitcom with its oddball situations that seem to consistently bear hefty consequences for its residents, but its characters still feel like real people we've come to known and care about. Unsurprisingly, Lemmon and Matthau share unbelievable conversational beauty in the way they engage in simple discussions that seem to constantly end in uproariously funny bickering. Once you minimize your focus on that aspect in the film, you have just an average comedy that, while charming and pleasantly safe (a good and bad quality for this particular kind of picture), is just grateful to be buoyed by two very talented leading men. Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Sophia Loren, and Burgess Meredith. Directed by: Howard Deutch. Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the 1st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10 Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. 2/5 stars - John Ulmer Great!; This is a rare sequel. Wait a minute, sequels aren't rare. Well, that's true, but a *good* sequel is rare. Most of the time, sequels aren't even in the same league as the originals. However, due to excellent writing, a superb cast and great direction, this film is every bit as enjoyable as Grumpy Old Men. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made several films together and they worked together extremely well. The gorgeous Ann Margaret reprises her role from the first film and is now Lemmon's wife. A new lady hits town and Matthau is very interested. This lovely creature is played by Sophia Loren, who is still stunningly beautiful. Burgess Meredith is great as Grandpa. The stellar cast ensures great acting. However, this film is also written such that there is literally a laugh nearly every minute. I found the film to be highly enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh. 1/10; this movie sucked! I hate it! It's so boring! The acting is so bad! Why does Sophia Loren's italian character talk english to her italian mother when they're alone? The script is so bad! It's so corny! Max and John fighting with the fishing things is so silly! This movie was never funny! It was painful to watch, i'm telling you! Avoid it! Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Oh, How The Mighty Have Fallen...; GRUMPY OLD MEN (3 outta 5 stars) GRUMPIER OLD MEN (2 outta 5 stars) I dunno why I even bothered to watch the second one. Oh, I guess because it was on cable TV shown as a double bill with the original \"Grumpy Old Men\". I liked the original when I first saw it. It was not the best work by the Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau team... but it had its moments... these two actors could probably read pages from the phone book to each other and still make it funny. Unfortunately, the sequel has even FEWER of those moments. Still, I maintain that no movie with either Lemmon OR Matthau in it can be *totally* worthless. This is probably as close as they ever got, though. (Bear in mind that I have not yet seen their last movie together, \"The Odd Couple II\".) Practically the same plot as the first movie... Lemmon and Matthau play lifelong acquaintances and next door neighbors who are constantly bickering about fish and/or women. Burgess Meredith plays Lemmon's FATHER... and if you find old people talking dirty hilarious then you'll probably love his scenes (especially in the closing credits outtakes). Ann Margaret and Sophia Loren play the women in the grumpy guys' lives... hard to imagine that women as attractive as they still are would want anything to do with these two old dorks but, hey... I guess pickings are slim after 65. The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down. Pretty Dang Funny; John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. We often expect sequels to be weaker than the original. But sometimes we may be pleasantly surprised. In this sequel, the \"grumpy old men\" are still up to their old tricks, going after each other and teaming up to close down a restaurant. Some of it may be a bit far-fetched (in real life, a store owner would get the cops involved) but it's good fun. Sadly, the film has the distinction of being Burgess Meredith's final film. On the plus side, he really goes out with a bang. His acting and delivery of witty lines is top notch, and the film does a great job of hiding his Alzheimer's. You can really feel the talent in his character. Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Grumpier Old Men (1995) **1/2; More of the same for those who enjoyed the first film, nothing great but a decent time killer. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return in their twilight years as the ever-battling duo, but this time with the added attraction of Sophia Loren who still looks gorgeous at age 60. She winds up posing a threat to their favorite bait and tackle shop when she decides to take it over and turn it into an Italian restaurant. Since Lemmon's already got sexy Ann-Margret as his hot girlfriend, Sophia hits it off with old man Matthau (ah, the magic of movies), who does not look as good for his age (75). Burgess Meredith is better used in this one in his role as Lemmon's naughty old pop. **1/2 out of **** Cute sequel that works; Fun story of two older men who never quite outgrew boyhood, and the ladies they love. What a treat to see two master actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, working with silly material and enjoying every minute of it. The lady loves, Ann Margret and the ever-sexy and dazzling Sophia Loren, do equally well with a lightweight, sometimes over-the-top script. The principals are aided by a uniformly fine supporting cast, including Burgess Meredith as the Lemmon character's outrageously lecherous dad, and Ann Morgan Guilbert as Sophia's feisty mama. The older players' interaction is a delight. My only quibble with this film is the fact that Meredith's character dies without getting married like everyone else. Why? I wondered whether Meredith had perhaps expired during filming, but, according to Wikipedia, the actor lived a whole two years following this movie's release! The original film, \"Grumpy Old Men,\" takes place during a picturesque Minnesota winter, with snow used to charming effect. The follow-up capitalizes on a Midwestern summer. Like apples and oranges, both productions satisfy. A vibrant sequel that's still underwhelming; I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They seem to work perfectly together, and with a better script, this movie could be gold. We are taken back to Minnesota to re-visit the old grumps who now have to plan a wedding for their very plain and very boring children. There's a reason Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah have never had substantial film careers- they're very uninteresting actors. But I digress. If \"Grumpy Old Men\" built up it's laughs, \"Grumpier Old Men\" topples them down. The best moments of both films are when Lemmon and Matthau trade vicious insults at one another, and also play pranks on each other. But when this is taken away, we're suffering every old cliché in the book, including Walter's tiresome 'Wholey Moley' line which is used so much, it could be taken into context for a Shot Party (take a shot every time Matthau 'Wholey Moley''s himself). The other problem with this series is the fact that gorgeous women fall for these two farts. Roger Ebert made a very valid point in his review for this film- first Ann-Margaret moves into the neighborhood and marries Jack Lemmon. Now the even more gorgeous Sophia Loren has set her sights on the incredibly unattractive Matthau. And why? For concepts in the plot. There's no reason a woman as beautiful and intelligent as Loren would fall for the dull and disgusting figure Matthau is. I know this is a comedy, but come on now! All in all this sequel is peppier and a little more fun then the original, but both movies suffer from overblown dramatic passages that are not needed. We want to see the old guys go at it, not Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah. I laughed a lot at this movie- mostly at the incredibly underrated Bergis Meredith as the foul-mouthed Grandpa. Since all three main actors have passed, we'll never see them again. At least Margaret and Loren are still alive and kicking. I'd love to see their movie: \"Grumpy Old Widows\". As Good As The Original; Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\". I don't agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love \"Buddy Buddy\" and \"The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile. after you have seen the first there is no point seeing this one; After the fun of watching Lemmon and Matthau act like kids for less than 2 hours (i.e. from the first movie) I was satisfied, but then due to the success of the first movie the producers decided to give it another twirl, this time the story had the two starting off as friends thanks to the incidents that happened in the ending of the first film, but then some really really idiotic stupid reason, they were at it again. The movie was not funny as it was like a replay of the first, same pranks, similar plot and screenplay made this movie a waste of time. After getting a mate for John, they (the producers) decided to get a mate for Max, with nothing to write home about but a lame script that just showed no finesse or true plan, just the producers hoping to bank on the success of the previous movie. The main disappointment in the movie for me was Sophia Loren; her acting was just too weak for me to understand that she is a star. Everybody else in the movie even Burgess Meredith (who had Alzheimer's disease and this was his last motion picture appearance) was impressive, at least that I can give them. The movie is directed this time by Howard Deutch, who later worked with the duo in 1998 for Odd Couple II, Deutch other movies also have not been well received like Getting Even with Dad (1994) and The Whole Ten Yards (2004), which are basically the reason why I will not bother seeing My Best Friend's Girl. The movie plot carries on 6 months after the incidents of the first, where both John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) were getting prepared for the wedding of their children. Then a new arrival in town a beautiful lady by the name of Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) came in to change things by turning the towns bait shop to a restaurant. John and Max join forces to try and run the new lady out of town, but the issues between John and Max's children marriage plan caused both to reignite their feud as both refused to believe that their child was at fault. Only the ladies are alive till today (February 2013), as both Lemmon and Matthau died like half a decade after this movie release. Grumpier Old Men was a box office success in its own part, but a huge critical disappointment, as the movie cost 10 million dollars less than its predecessor and made like a million more in the box office. After you have seen the first there is basically no point why you should bother seeing this one, because it will stand in my mind as one movie I credit as a waste of time and talent. www.lagsreviews.com Good Laughs; Grumpier Old Men (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to Grumpy Old Men have Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau returning with more fights and foul language. This time out Lemmon is still happily married but Matthau is on the move and takes a special interest in an Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved to town. I think the most remarkable thing about this film is how well Loren looked. Even at 61 she's still a head turner and her comic timing isn't too bad either. I'm sure this film was only made because the first one made money but it doesn't really matter as no one should take this too serious as it's just a silly comedy meant to make you laugh. There are plenty of nice laughs here but I don't think it's as good as the original. This certainly isn't in the league as The Odd Couple but we do get a pretty good throwback to that film here as there's a scene where Lemmon has to spend the night with Matthau but can't put up with his dirty house. Ann-Margret returns but is pretty much wasted as is Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak. The perverted Burgess Meredith is back and steals the scene every time he's in it. Both Matthau and Lemmon are naturally very good and they easily slip back into their roles. It's priceless watching the two men work together even when the material isn't as strong as one would hope. Lemmon gets a special notice here due to a very touching scene with Meredith. Another problem is the direction, which has one of those \"made for TV\" feels to it. In the end this film could have and should have been a lot better but the cast make it worth watching. Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT 7 out of 10 OLDER, HORNIER AND STILL FRUSTRATED IN MINNESOTA;  `Grumpier Old Men' is a film that is a sequel to `Grumpy Old Men.' Reprising their original roles are Jack Lemmon as John Gustafson, Walter Matthau as Max Goldman, Ann Margaret as Ariel, Burgess Meredith as John's father, Kevin Pollock and Darryl Hannah as the children of Max and John. They are still next-door neighbors, only now the feud has subsided. Their children are living across the street in Ariel's house.  The marriage of their children is on the horizon. The setting for this film is summer and fall in Minnesota.  Fishing is still the main sport where `Catfish Hunter' is still the elusive prize.  The bait shop on the lake has been closed since Chuck passed away.  It is now under new management.  John and Max are anxiously waiting the reopening.  To their surprise, it is not being reopened as a bait shop, but a ristorante (restaurant).  Here enters Sophia Loren as the new proprietress Maria Sophia Calotti Ragetti.  Ann Guilbert who plays her mother joins her.  When Max and John find out the new plans for their favorite bait shop, they set out to undermine her plans for a grand opening.  A series of misunderstandings set off a domino effect that touches everyone's lives.  New loves are found and an old feud is rekindled. All of the same emotions that were in the previous film are in this film. There is laughter, sadness, anger and happiness.  Catfish Hunter makes his film debut, which, in essence, puts a `face' with a name.  His film appearance pays credence to the fact that he is a `real' fish and not just a myth.   The acting in this film is superb both by human and non-human.  Still having a good ol' time!; I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men back to back, so I could see both instead of my normal rent one sequel at a time ordeal. I just finished Grumpier Old Men this morning and was expecting a modest sequel, but it turned into a great sequel, pretty much to the point where I enjoyed Grumpier Old Men to Grumpy Old Men. Despite the fact that they use some old jokes, this was a fun plot and I thought the guys have gotten even funnier, including John's father, he's a little dirty, but so much fun to laugh at. John and Max are now best friends again and couldn't be happier with each other, their son and daughter are about to get hitched, and they are overwhelming with the wedding plans. Max is starting to get lonely though, since Chuck has passed on, the bait shop is given to two older Italian women, one lady, Maria, starts a little feud with Max wanting to turn the bait shop into a restaurant. But their anger turns into a hidden passion and they end up falling head over heals for each other, but Maria has some hidden skeletons in her closet. Grumpier Old Men is proof that you are never too old to fall in love or have your heart broken again. It was so sweet seeing Max fall in love with Maria, I loved their passion for each other, it was so fun to watch. John's father and Maria's mother were just so awesome and funny, they had such great chemistry! I would highly recommend Grumpier Old Men, it's a great comedy that once again touches your heart and tickles your funny bone. 8/10 funny funny; I, too, found the film very funny and until reading about it here couldn't remember who played the other woman with Burgess Meredith at the end of the film, the scene that made the whole film complete.  Without giving away what happened at the end of the film, the other woman was that gorgeous elder lady of many great films - Sophia Loren.  What a delicious surprise!  Good also for any old grumpy man! Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter & Jack's previous films together. It was this film & the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max & John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. A sequel that's equal to the original comedy; The first go round was such a hit, that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau got together for this sequel to the 1993 smash hit, \"Grumpy Old Men.\" And \"Grumpier Old Men\" is every bit as good as the first film. It has some new characters and the scene changes from winter to summer, then winter and spring. Most reviewers don't talk about the surprise of the wedding in the first film. And I won't do that for that film or this one. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) team up for a time in the movie to plan the wedding of their daughter and son, Melanie and Jacob (played by Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak). And, later, to try to thwart the conversion of their bait shop into an Italian restaurant. Sophia Loren is the added ingredient for much humor as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti. She's a cousin of \"Spaghetti\" Ragetti, whom John and Max know. Her mother is in the picture, Mama Ragetti, played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. And, grandpa Gustafson is back, with Burgess Meredith now a couple years older. He tells son, John, as they sit by the lake drinking beer, that he sometimes thinks God has forgotten about him. The hijinks and capers in this film include some hilarious pranks the two friendly enemies pull on the Ragettis. As with the original film, this one supposedly takes place in Wabasha, Minnesota. While it is a real town on the Mississippi River border with Wisconsin, the filming for this and the earlier movie was done in a number of places around that area of southeastern Minnesota. So, anyone going to Wabasha won't find the fishing lake, the town overlook or some other scenes shown in these films. With the 10 films they made together  especially the nine comedies, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have delighted audiences for decades. May they outlive Catfish Hunter and continue amuse people for decades to come. Loren is still hot; Grumpy old men was an OK comedy with a nice performance by Ann-Margret, but otherwise forgettable. This film, on the other hand, has some real comic touches that actually also have something to say about the aging process - and life really doesn't end until it ends. But first the bad news: Daryl Hannah. I've liked her in other films, but she is so flat in this, she's a distraction. She doesn't have the feel for these characters, not even her own, and so doesn't quite fit. She's not even credible as the mother of the young girl who is so important in her relationship to great=grand-dad Burgess Meredith. There must have been some plot device they could have come up with to leave her out of the picture altogether; oh, well. Now the really good news: Sophia Loren. I admit I have always had a crush on her since I saw Houseboat as a kid; and when I saw the shower scene in Arabesque, i couldn't sleep for a week. Her performance here is splendid (romantic comedy is one of her strengths, after all), but the really really good news is that she was past sixty when she made this film, and she looks hot enough to burn a young man's fingers! Really - if I'd been Walter Matthau in that bar scene, I'd have gone out with a heart-attack right there - and smiling. With an adequate script, and such superb actors, Deutsch wisely lets the formula roll on without interference. Consequently, whatever the short-comings there's plenty to remember fondly from this film. Oh, and don't miss the blooper-reel that runs under the final credits - Matthau and Meredith are having a grand old time. Oh, and Sophia Loren is still hot. not much fun; Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still combative while maintaining their truce. John is married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) now and his father (Burgess Meredith) is still spry. Everybody is chasing after the big fish Catfish Hunter. Meanwhile, their children Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are planning to get married. Newcomer Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in Wabasha to buy the bait shop and turn it into an Italian restaurant. It's a continuation that's missing much of the fun. It is contrived. It's great to see these great actors working together but that's all I got out of it. I found very few laughs. Who would have ever guessed that it's the same place?; For the most part, \"Grumpier Old Men\" is pretty silly. Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still at each other's throats when Italian immigrant Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in town and throws everything into flux. What actually struck me most about the movie was how different the town looked in this one from the original. Obviously, it was a different time of year, but maybe the different look was meant to show how everything might be changing in the town. Other than that, Ann-Margret returns as Ariel, and she's still as free-spirited and vivacious as she was in the original. Burgess Meredith - in his final role - is still the grandfather who can exercise absolute authority over the youngsters, although he now has the hots for Maria's mother (Ann Morgan Guilbert, aka Millie on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\"). Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah also reprise their roles from the original...ah, and there's that fish. All in all, a fairly interesting movie. Not any kind of masterpiece, but it showed that Lemmon and Matthau still had it. Snoozing sequel with the leads in need of some No-Doz; Woeful, disappointing sequel to 1993's hit \"Grumpy Old Men\" is more retread than follow-up. The two crotchety neighbors--Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--bicker over their children (who will soon be making the sparring oldsters in-laws!) and, of course, who has the better fishing skills. They stop trading insults long enough for Matthau to begin irritating a new woman in town, a fiery Italian who has just opened her own restaurant. Sitcom humor with a sometimes-raunchy twist that is no longer fresh. Almost worth-seeing for Sophia Loren's funny, lively performance, but everyone else looks a little sleepy. Ann-Margret (who married Lemmon's character at the end of the original) must've dropped in for a day and a half to complete her work. As the youthful couple, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah are also under-used. ** from **** A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life & Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau & Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman & John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a 7.4 out of 10 As equally funny as the original, but with an Italian flair!!!!; This sequel to Grumpy Old Men is as funny as the original. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and the rest of the cast from the original movie reprise their roles. John and Max are still feuding, but the tension between them has softened. There are, however, some changes: Ariel and John are married and there's a new girl in town named Maria Ragetti. She's moved to Wabasha to open up an Italian restaurant at the former Chuck's Bait place. When the boys discover what Maria's intentions are, they hatch a scheme to ruin the grand opening of the restaurant and try to keep Chuck's business going, even though the inventory of the former business has been cleared out and the interior remodeled to look like an Italian restaurant. Max and Sophia meet, but there's a disagreement about what the place should be. Maria goes to the neighborhood bar to try and reason with Max, but to no avail. It seems as though Max and John have trouble saying goodbye to what is no longer there. The humor between Lemmon and Matthau's characters is still spiced up and is still able to put viewers in stitches. Then, Max and Maria get married, and the restaurant starts selling bait, as well. Great movie, great cast, great fun!!  \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Feel Good Movie; The acting in this film is phenomenal, especially on the part of Angela Bassett who always does an amazing job (see What's Love Got To Do With It). The inter-cuts work well where they are placed, much like all of the other shots, and keep the films pace and the viewer interested. I've read other user comments and I find their opinions to be completely biased and unwarranted. If you're watching this film looking for profound insight to life you will be disappointed. This film is an adaptation of Terry McMillan's critically acclaimed novel FOR BLACK FEMALES. Waiting to Exhale explores the lives of four female friends. Each woman makes mistakes and has to deal with those consequences. But it is through being there for one another that they overcome these problems and others. For me, most of the negative user comments are from people who the film was not made for, that are only analyzing the film from the story. There is more to a film than it's narrative and when base your full opinion on that alone you are missing out. Plus, for me, it's just flat-out annoying when people who are completely not the target audience bash a film. Note: this is not to say that art cannot breach color, age or sex barriers. But be let's be realistic for a moment. If say, a heterosexual, black, 21 year old female studying Art was asking you for a good movie suggestion for a Friday night...Would you suggest The Dukes Of Hazard? I think not. Not unless you were joking. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Excellent for the broken heart...; Perhaps the reason they call this movie a chick flick, is because that's exactly who it's aimed at. Women. I don't see this as a man bashing movie, but more as a \"how do you deal?\" type of movie. It covers every situation: The unworthy co-worker, The drug-addict boyfriend, the gay husband, the cheating husband, the married man, the New Years fling, the sweet attractive neighbor, the teenage son....but most importantly, it show how women react and deal with the lies, the cheating, and the friendships between both men AND women...and how to survive from that. Any woman who has ever gone through a relationship can relate to this movie, regardless of race, situation, or age. You will want to scream, cry and laugh throughout the whole movie, and I can guarantee that every woman has got a little Angela Bassett in her, especially when she rips through her ex-husbands belongings. Two thumbs up...A definite must-see for any woman with a wounded heart. Don't Exhale Just Yet; I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It's not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others, it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However, the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria -- even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger, Holly Hunter, Alfre Woodard and others. Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight, insecure no-nonsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight, but she was the only one who found it (and deserved it). She was the only one who didn't sleep around, wasn't a man basher, set a good example for her son, and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face -- look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things, her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent, good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie. Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package --- beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life - she could now start her catering business, she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end. Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book, you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men. Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same -- Whitney Houston being well groomed, pretending to be well spoken and classy, and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise (although she might have been too young). The character had to tell us she was smart -- in a phone conversation with her mother she said \"I'm smart, I'm a good person and I work hard.\" Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills, doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end. This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn't \"tell this story\" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were. Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue? Extra in Movie; I was actually an extra in this movie and had a quite a fun time hanging out w/the cast/crew. I had an opportunity to be at several of the locations for days of filming and it was a lot of work. You don't realize what a day of filming entitles until you actually do it and I was just an extra. I was more interested in the process of the film making than being on camera so it was a great opportunity. I even got \"spoiled\" and met a lot of the cast and drove around in the SUV's that are for the main cast...fun stuff! I think over all the movie was to enjoy for fun. I think the basis of the friendships were the most important aspect of the film. That through all the craziness of men in their lives they were still there for one another. This film does Terry McMillan's writing no justice; This movie had great potential had it landed in the right directors hands (as seen with How Stella got Her Groove Back).  Many rough cuts, sloppy editing, and terrible lighting at times to name a few.  Casting was excellent with the exception of Whitney Houston who has the tendency to over-chew her scenes.  Though much of the book was not adapted to the film the strength and love amongst four friends was apparent.  It was the one thing that was not lost or left on the cutting room floor.  Good movie, better book. Waiting to Exhale (the movie) ***** (5 stars) Waiting to Exhale (the novel) ********** (ten stars) A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops & horrible movies. My favorite movie ever !; I'm so surprised by the comments i read here. Since i saw that movie maybe 10 years ago now, it's one of my favorite movie ever along with boomerang.Maybe it's because i was fairly young when i watched those movies.. but i find them extremely good. I watched the movie before i read the book and it may be the reason why i loved the movie so much. Sure Whitney's acting could have been better but she managed to do a pretty decent job overall. As for the soundtrack it's a pure bliss for RnB lovers and i would say a classic now. The image of Black men in the movie is very negative but in a sens it pushed to be the exact opposite so it kinda shaped my vision and my life, and \"deepend\" my love of black women. Some parts of the movie are just so classic like the break up between Robin and troy on the balcony and the soundtrack at that moment was some kind of a symphony.. anyways great great movie .. enjoy Double Standard; So I finally got around to watching \"Waiting to Exhale\" on Encore the other night and I don't understand why this became a hit. (Note: spoilers ahead) As far as I can tell, the basic premise of this film is that all men are insensitive, callous and unfeeling; especially towards women. Okay, well and good. That is the storyline? Fine. Men suck, got it. But there is a huge double standard here; two of the women are dating married men and clearly, we are meant to be sympathetic about their plight as they whine and cry about not having \"their\" man with them at night in bed. How about this? STOP DATING MARRIED MEN! Maybe that's your problem in the first place. Now, on the flip side, Angela Basset's character is abandoned by her husband for another woman. Yet, if you pay attention, even this character is not completely innocent. When her husband informs her he is leaving, the things she says makes it clear she's known about his lover(s) for years but ignored his infidelities. Why? Obviously, because he's so wealthy. She liked all the \"stuff\" a little too much to have confronted him about it. Again, she's made her bed here, not as completely as the two who are actively cheating, but still. She spends the rest of the movie being so angry that he left her you never really grow to like her. Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer; he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar. With their clothes on, which apparently means it's oh-so-platonic and sweet. Then he writes her a letter months later, thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off, he'll contact her again. Did anyone else think this was more than a little sleazy? I would hope if I were dying of breast cancer that my husband wasn't out sleeping around (and I do mean just sleeping) with other women. Sweet, platonic, whatever; I think it's pretty horrible. Bottom line; the characters you're supposed to connect to are unlikable and the ones you're supposed to hate are just pathetic. Not very enjoyable. However, I did give it three stars for the music, which didn't suck too badly and the clothes and style. It's a nice little snapshot of how things looked in '95. And the print wasn't very faded. That's about it, though. Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life. Please. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation. A real disaster!; This movie is awful! The caracters are shallow and almost ridiculous, especially Lela Rochon. It's a very, very, very bad soap opera. I was watching this movie with my wife and we were laughing almost all the time. It is much too long, with no rhythm with absolutely no emotions. It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one cliché after another. Skip it, it's a waste of time! A One-Sided Celebration of African American Feminism; Directed by Forest Whitaker and adapted from a smash best selling novel by Terry McMillan, WAITING TO EXHALE is a glossy, but one-sided look at the relationship between four strong black women and the various men in their lives. The film is one-sided because the screenplay presents most of the male characters as sexist, manipulative pigs without a redeeming characteristic in sight, but the sensitive direction and outstanding performances keep the rather lopsided story watchable. Whitney Houston made an impressive film debut as Savannah, an ambitious television executive caught in a dead-end affair with a married man (Dennis Haysbert). Angela Basset does Oscar-worthy work as Bernadine, a woman who has spent her life being the best wife and mother she knows how to be, who has her world rocked when her wealthy husband (Michael Beach) calmly announces one night before a formal dinner party that he's in love with someone else and wants a divorce. The scene where Bernadine gathers all her husband's stuff and makes a bonfire out of it in her driveway is one of the film's highlights. Lela Rochon plays Robin, a not-too-bright doormat who finds herself pregnant by a man she wants nothing to do with. Loretta Devine is fun as Gloria, a hairdresser who is divorced from her husband, who it turns out was gay, and is struggling to raise her son (Donald Faison) and tries to begin a relationship with a new neighbor (Gregory Hines). If you can accept the fact that in the world of these four women, all men are pigs, then this film can be very entertaining but the top-notch performances by the cast cannot be overlooked. FAbuLOuS; Simply fabulous. I thought it was a great movie. I was completely empowered! It made me want to start my exes car on fire. Embrace your independence  watch this movie. (is great to watch with the scorned over glasses of wine and bon bons) It'll make you laugh, cry, get mad, and then plot getting even. I can waste a lot of your time telling you to see it, defending it from what others say about it, or just generally talking it up. But haven't you always wanted to see Angela Basset throw a fit? How bout cut her hair off? And who wouldn't want to watch Whitney act with humility. This is by far my favorite movie with Whitney - second, The Bodyguard - third, The Preachers Wife. Frustrating...; That's the word I'd use to describe the film, an adaptation of Terry McMillan's 1992 best-seller. It's not great, it's not bad, but it's frustrating to watch, and the fact that I'm of the male persuasion undoubtedly had something to do with it. Now, let me be the first to say that I did enjoy seeing a group of strong black women portrayed onscreen. To say that Hollywood has been exceedingly lax in this regard is an understatement. But it would've been nice if their collective talents hadn't been squandered on this disgustingly anti-male tirade. Especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine, who otherwise shine in everything their names are attached to. Good, solid movies about sisterhood are probably needed now more than ever, but not at the cost of shortchanging the good, upright, decent brothers out there, whom this movie largely forgets about (with some notable exceptions -- Gregory Hines, for example.) And the frustration doesn't end there. Both Savannah and Robin manage to find themselves involved with the most shady characters (a married man and a dope fiend, respectively), yet they complain about the lack of good men out there. I suppose it would be silly to question just where they've been looking, even though it might hold the answer. The sad thing is that there are fellas out there who have little to no regard for women (\"the scum of the f__king earth\", to quote Savannah), and women who fall for fellas like that for the most silly, shallow reasons. If it wasn't for Bassett, Devine, and Babyface's score, this movie would barely be watchable. As it is, it's a moderately entertaining diversion, albeit a frustrating one. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE HARD TRUTH) looked VERY beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts REALLY made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. I give this one 2 out of 10. Pathetic; This film is simply about a bunch of women who pick men who's behaviors they claim to hate & then spend the rest of their time complaining about them. It seems that this view is held by many women & possibly accounts in some measure to the number of women who consider their relationships with men to be unsatisfying. Decent; Those of you who ranted and raved about how horrible this film was really tickle my funny bone. I love to see miserable people hate a movie just because...well, they have nothing to better to do. Not saying this was the best movie I've ever seen. But I agree with others who say that Bassett and Levine are the ones to save this film from drowning with all the other horrible movies. I love Angela Bassett, I'm a huge fan of hers. The scene which depicts the morning after her husband leaves her for his secretary, which would've otherwise been too cliché for my taste had it not been for the way Bernie (Bassett) burned up that BMW! I mean that was classic. Sorry if any of you testosterone-fueled men out there will accuse me of man hating, but I love that scene and will watch it over and over again. Three cheers for Angie. And Devine's character, Gloria seems sort of weak and unable to stand up to even her teenage son, but I love how she bends a little and confesses how she feels to the late Gregory Hines' character. You'll notice Devine's Gloria and Bassett's Bernie are slightly juxtaposed but their chemistry is excellent. If you haven't seen it, check it out, if not for anything but the performance of these two gifted actors. Whitney ruined the great potential; Angela Basset was good as expected, but Whitney has no Range as an actress. The screenplay also neglected to portray, on film, the greatness of this novel.  Instead of promoting sisterhood, they emphasized the canine-qualities of men.  Read the book; rent Soul Food instead! Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this 1995 film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Hilarious in Parts; 1995 was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in 1995, the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection great touching story; While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life's mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great. WAITING TO EXHALE : Waiting To Go Somewhere, But Sadly It Never Does...; WAITING TO EXHALE Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. \"Waiting To Exhale\", Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book, had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it's star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene. \"Waiting To Exhale\" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone. It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn't know the word \"feelings\" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change. For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they've experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don't seem to learn squat. It's like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. \"Waiting To Exhale\" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose. ... D ... I wanna move to Arizona; I thought It was a great movie, although it is a lot of sleeping with other women husband that are taken, we all have to be honest, this goes on a lot in reality. it's not right, but it happens.... Overall I really enjoy the movie because it took me way back to 1995, the movie was great. great times, although I was just 11 when it came out, I remember all the hype over this movie from my mom n my aunts.... One factor that I've never notice before was the setting... It makes me wanna pack up my family an move to peaceful Arizona.. Great Movie. r.i.p. Whitney Houston I cannot believe it took me all this time to see this movie all the way through... Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... not bad; this movie and its story are quite good on the whole..........Ms Bassett is the leading and the best actress,for sure.I get her character.she's beautiful and I guess she's blown people away with her beauty and the EASE WITH WHICH SHE FASCINATES.Ms HOUSTON IS NOT TO NEGLECT NEITHER.She looks natural in this one.And despite her little experience as far as her actress career is concerned,she is good even though her story is a bit common .Loretta is divine!Anyways,this motion picture is merely good.There's nothing amazing.And it don't stand out from all the other movies.the only thing that makes me stick to the screen is the complicity and the crude humor on men of the four ladies! A bit too soapy but deserves respect for being a positive film for black women; Vannah is travelling to see her friend Bernie while leaving behind all her old live to start anew.  Bernie has just been left by her husband of 13 years for a white woman.  Robin wants to be loved and happy but always makes the wrong choices.  Glo has an estranged husband and the only man in her life is her teenage son.  The four get together through their struggles in love and live as they try to put it all together again. This is very much a woman's film and, as a man, it's easy for me to criticise it for being a weepy or for being a bit of a woman love in, so I won't.  The plot is pure soap opera, the lives and loves of our 4 women, however it is still involving as the four stories all have strengths as well as weaknesses.  The mix of comedy and sentiment is a bit too much 20:80 and at times the sentiment gets too much, but the sassy characters keep the interest. The soapy sentiment isn't helped by a poor soundtrack and poor use there of. In itself I like some of the love ballad r'n'b stuff  but here it felt like it was all over every scene.  This really bogs it down. Also a down side is the whole man hating thing  only a few come off looking good.  I thought the director being a man would help redress the balance but it seemed to have no effect. Why  can someone tell me  was Houston chosen to lead this talented black cast?  Was it because she could do a cut price soundtrack?  She's a poor actress and he spoiled her scenes  she needs to stay in TVM's.  Bassett however is powerful as ever and really steals every single scene she's in.  Devine adds comedy and sauce while Rochon is perfect as the vulnerable beauty going about love the wrong way.  The male cast is great too  there are so many well known faces in this with only two criticisms of them  1  everytime I see Haysbert now all I can think of is his 24 character.  And 2  Wesley Snipes' character just don't convince me at all. Overall to criticise this for being girly or sentimental is to miss the point.  It is actually good to see a film with so many good roles for black actresses.  It's a bit too soapy for my taste but it is funny and involving with a commanding Bassett.  Only Huston, a soppy soundtrack and constant man caricatures spoil it. The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Sticky; There was nothing in the movie that made me excited. The message did not come through,  if there was one. Perhaps it is to convey the idea that men are useless,  or that relations are complicated because women make it complicated. If a comedy,  I did not laugh.  If a drama,  I did not find it dramatic. It was like drinking a cup of coffee presented to you with way too much sugar. Good movie, Better book; This wasn't a bad movie. The acting was great (although Whitney Houston still seems mediocre). Some of the scenes were powerful and funny. However, unlike the book which also deals with the sisterhood of Black women, the movie becomes a long \"Men are pigs\" tirade that gets weary after a while. Plus it's sometimes hard to root for the characters. For instance, considering all the one-night stands Savannah has, it's hard to see why she's questioning her ability to find a good man. Overall, Waiting to Exhale, is basically a sorely-needed bonding movie for African-American women that, while a little biased, is good escapist fun. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about 15 or 16 and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker. 6 of 10 stars. This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Great female flick of the '90s!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track 6: This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! A 3 is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. Hot Soundtrack, Terrible Character Development; Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end.  It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.  However, much of this is wasted on poor character development.  Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover.  What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies.  While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all.  For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script.  Clearly the answer is that it isn't.  Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with.  Why the director didn't see this, I don't know. Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface. 4/10 Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. in response to your response; I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a 10, i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol \"Father 2\" : Born again.; Okay,now the sequel \"Father Of The Bride 2\",which was surprisingly better than expected. Like anyone who sees a sequel,you expect almost a carbon copy of the first. It does start similar to the first movie,with George sitting in a chair addressing us,the audience. It also does an unfortunate repeat of the fight between Annie & Bryan,again like the first movie,I saw it coming. The baby shower party is not played big,like the first after wedding party but I laughed when actual storks carrying little bundles showed up. I was kind of \"iffy\" on the sub-plot of George selling the house,having to leave in ten days and then blowing a bundle to get it back again. I'm not questioning the probability (we know in reality that'd be impossible),I just found it kind of unnecessary. I did however like his dyed hair and new look,that was hilarious and he should have kept it until the end of the movie. Some may say the idea of a mother & daughter being pregnant at the same time,is impossible. Yet,somehow it works here. It's not just the obvious next step for Annie but for George and his wife too,who thought having babies was way behind them. I love Steve Martin's warped expression when Bryan calls him a \"Grandfather\"! I liked that a woman having a baby in her 40's was taken very seriously,since it's a fact that women who have babies later in life have a more difficult time. It makes for a good piece of drama in a film that's otherwise a family comedy. The comedy is helped once again by the presence of Martin Short and I like that he becomes more involved with the family. Especially helping George out the front door on his back. This after giving him sleeping pills for rest. Once the babies are born and Bryan & Annie head to Boston for a new life,the film gets a very touching ending with George and his new baby girl. 8 out of 10 for the expected repeat of ideas,otherwise a very well made sequel. (END) A (Rare) Good Sequel; The first \"Father of the Bride\" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin's great comedic \"Dad\" character with the emotions of marrying off his \"only\" (to that point!) daughter. However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor. Thankfully, \"Father of the Bride II\" does not fall into this trap. With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather. Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton). Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women! Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments. Whereas the first film captured George's equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George's identity crisis. With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family. Overall, this film is just as good as the original. The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare. Let's just say that if a \"Grandfather of the Bride\" were in the works, I would be first in line. I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. Fantastic; Both the first movie and this sequel are fantastic. I loved the first movie, so I thought I would give the second one a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised!! The acting from all the characters is amazing, from Steve Martin to Diane Keaton to Kimberly Williams-Paisley. 16 years after its release this movie is still a gem. When I'm feeling down or just need a go-to comedy for a night in, these two movies are the best. For those who say that a 40-something woman is too old to have a baby--that's just not true. Do your research. I bet more people have been in that situation than you think. Anyway, this is a feel-good movie for some great laughs and a few happy tears! Average comedy sequel; There's been better, and there's been worse. \"Father of the Bride Part II\" falls right in between when it comes to sequels of comedies. The plot was easily predictable and the movie didn't have as many Steve Martin funny moments as the original. There were some good moments that made me laugh though, most being scenes with Martin Short. It did seem like sort of a stretch, though that all of the sudden \"Frank\" was an interior designer as well as a wedding/baby shower coordinator. I guess they just needed a way to keep him in the movie longer. I was hoping for a lot more when I rented this. My advice: stick to the original. Very Warm and Funny.; This movie is a very warm and funny family film. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the Sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny. The only thing I didn't like was Eugene Levy's character, I found that his part was just put there to extend the movie a bit. I also didn't like how they used him in the second one when he was clearly the one who auditioned to be the wedding singer in the first one. All in all this is a great family film where many will enjoy and watch together. Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! Not as good as the first, but still great fun.; In the sequel to the brilliant Father Of The Bride, Nina Banks and her daughter Annie are both pregnant and George Banks, being his usual nervous self has to learn to get used to the idea that he's going to be a father again AND a grandfather. The whole cast including, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams and Martin Short are all back here giving good performances. Even though Father Of The Bride Part II is not as good as the first Father Of The Bride, this is still a great movie which is enjoyable and fun all the way through and that's why I'm going to give this good sequel a 10/10.  Good, so long as you don't try to think too much; It was a fun movie, but it had no particular substance. I mostly watched it because I'd seen the first one. And because it was free on my cable. Or at least, I wasn't paying only to see it. Now, I have done that before and been pleasantly surprised, but this just wasn't one of those movies. Most of what was in this movie has been done already in the first film, and then it was in a much better way. Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, I'm just glad that I got to watch it free. Sure, Steve Martin's always fun to watch, particularly when he's acting dopey for whatever reason, but that didn't make it a great film. Just mediocre. Still, it's fun for a laugh. Funny Sequel; Geogre Banks is getting used to life without his precious daughter Anne. Now he is thinking about all the free time he will have when his son is out of the house.That`s when Anne announces that she is going to have a baby.Geogre is shocked but he becomes even more shocked when he finds out his wife is going to have baby as well.Now he has to deal Franck helping out with the two pregnant women.Can Geogre ever get a break? This is my second favorite movie.My first is Father of the bride part I.This is a good movie.See it it is a great sequel.It is almost as good as the first one. Steve Martin steals the screen. Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. As I understand it, there were accusations of anti-Arab stereotyping?; \"Father of the Bride II\" may seem to some people like a lesser Steve Martin movie, with him as the patriarch from the previous movie now having to deal with his daughter's and wife's pregnancies. Unpretentiously silly. But one interesting thing is that apparently, some Arab groups claimed that the movie was making anti-Arab stereotypes, as a Middle Eastern man buys their house with plans to demolish it. I wouldn't have interpreted that as anti-Arab; I mean, it's not like they're portraying him as a terrorist. Oh well, life goes on. The movie's a nice, goofy way to pass time. I really liked the scene where they bring Steve Martin into the hospital (that would've sure been an embarrassment!). Also starring Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, B.D. Wong and Eugene Levy. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. good, but a mistake; this movie rocks. but there is one thing weird. okay, so in the beginning Annie says, \"i have lived here since i was 5!\" and then later right when they are selling the house and playing basketball Annie and George(her dad) and her dad says \"i remember the first time we played out here, you were 4.\" wait...so was she 4 or 5 when they moved in??????????? other than that this movie makes me laugh, cry(because i laugh so much), and..........uh.....what was that other thing people say when they say that? i don't really remember. i just love how Steve martin always is so cheap. I am forced to say more so i will say i love that this movie is always on HBO! And i realized something, Steve martin has had white hair like forever! Entertaining, but the premise has been worn thin -- it's sweet, but unnecessary.; The original \"Father of the Bride\" with Spencer Tracey is a really good comedy, the remake starring Steve Martin is a good sweet-natured, amiable enough comedy - and I don't really think a sequel was necessary at all. I mean the whole premise is basically the same - before George Banks (Martin) had to grasp the reality of his daughter being married, and now he has to come to grips with the fact that she's having a baby. A nice twist on this is that his wife (played by Diane Keaton) is ALSO pregnant, but nevertheless it's still (basically) the same as the first film in one form or another. Thankfully it doesn't seem like a total cash-in (like so many sequels of this sort do) because it has a certain charm (as did the first film) and is still remarkably entertaining, all considered. But you can tell it was made solely because of the success of the first film - even Martin Short is back with another extended cameo as Franz the wedding manager. Of course you may be wondering why he's involved with a pregnancy, since his business is weddings. Here's a hint: more $$$ for the studio. Martin is basically doing the same thing he did in the first film - the weary upper-class guy who feels overwhelmed by the state of things. Diane Keaton is still very sweet and likable as his wife. The rest of the cast (including Macaulay's little brother Kieran Culkin) range from OK to good. Martin Short, however, is yet again a stand-out and is very funny - he wasn't necessary for the plot but he is funny and a good addition to the movie regardless. Overall I'd say this is one of those sequels that didn't need to be made, but could have been a lot worse. It's sweet, it's got some good lite-comedy moments, and in general it's just an enjoyable family movie that isn't trying to be anything other than simple entertainment -- which it is. Good, but first one was better; This film is good but you have to suspend disbelief quite a few times. All the performances are fine, with Steve Martin a scream again, and Diane Keaton glowing from start to finish (she has a lot more to do here than in FOTB1). The best scenes are: George trying to get buff in the gym, asking which famous men he's younger than, pointing to his wedding ring at the lady in the car next to him, and seeing all the misbehaving children out the window in his car while his wife sees all the happy kids and their parents out her window. And of course, when George holds his child and grandchild outside the delivery room. My favorite line: \"Now going to the movies will be economical: one child, two seniors, thanks!\" Good; This is well worth seeing. Everything goes perfectly. Ain't no such thing as too much Steve Martin, baby. Here Martin carries weak material, but it's a positive movie that shows the joy a new child brings. You will laugh, cry and cheer. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Some of the dialog is a bit lost on US audiences, but still some hilarious lines. The music is amazing throughout. Also the scenery is incredible. I saw the cast had a lot of great comedians, so I thought there would at least be a few laughs. Instead, I was surprised to see a very touching movie, absolutely great script. I give it 7 out of 10. What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the 1951 sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of 50. This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! The Best Movie of All Time; let me tell you.. anyone who does not like the movie is just a little close minded.. i read comments that thought the movie was too unrealistic but thats what makes it so great! i mean look at other movies such as lord of the rings or star wars neither or them contain true reality.. this is why its a movie. Anyway, i loved Steve martin in this movie. he does a magnificent job of playing the character for an over protective dramatic father. he was the best actor. who could have played the part of Nina as well as Diane Keaton. she makes the part of the mom annoyingly overwhelming mother, which is exactly what the point of us as the audience to think of her. martin short is the best of all \"fra'nk's\". the way he seeks George banks's approval is perfect. and lastly Kimberly Williams is the gorgeous daughter we are all expecting her to be.. i watch this movie every night before bed and i can recite every word to this movie. because of father of the bride II i have dreamed to meet Steve martin.. \"hes my hero!!\" hopefully you fall in love with it too. and dream to be pregnant with your mother as did Annie banks. My comments are going to be very positive.; Hi! I think that Father of the Bride Part 2 was a great film and very hilarious. I think that the mother and daughter could have been pregnant at the same time!  It was a great movie and I recommend it to all people who want a warm-your-heart comedy! It's a great film! Thanks! Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the 1951 movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the 1950 classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the 4 year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com I really found this film quite annoying; My basic opinion of this movie is that it is a crappy American feel good comedy. It is simply about a man who is going through another mid-life crisis as his daughter, who was married in the first movie, has a baby in this one. The catch is that his wife is also pregnant and with the irony really dripping, both of them have their babies within minutes of each other. As such the kid's auntie is exactly the same age as him (it won't happen to me, though it is possible). When I watch this movie I think to myself, this guy really doesn't have problems. There are people out there that have much more serious problems than he does. He admits to having a beautiful wife who loves him, owns his own home (or did), has a great job and great kids - and he thinks he has problems. Maybe the whole comedy is in the fact that he is worrying about absolutely nothing, but seriously, when I watch this movie, I simply shake my head and think that the guy is a loser. I really don't think it is all that funny. In fact, the guy has much more serious problems. He seems to be spending an awful lot of money, and is going to find himself in a huge amount of debt, and he doesn't seem to ever be at work. My question is not only where he gets his money, but where he gets the collateral for all of the purchases he is making. He buys back his house for an extra $100,000 on top of what he sold it for, and really, how can he seriously afford it. Okay, it wasn't all that bad. As a movie is was made well, and I did chuckle a few times. But in reality, this guy is a serious loser because he has more than anybody could possibly ask for, and he is worried about growing old. Hell, we all grow old, but he has experience more than what a lot of us have already had. Instead of worrying about growing old, the twit should look back on his life and be thankful for the blessings that God has already given him as opposed to forgetting all of that and winging about his age. like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $15k bonus to move out in 10 days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $100k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. Father of the Bride II; Likable, but not as impressive a follow up to the 1991 hit with Martin now dealing with his daughter being pregnant...And, oh yeah...his wife is pregnant again too. Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie. Touching even in its weak state.; Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, and kimberly Williams Paisley return in Father of the Bride Part 2. The film as a sequel was slightly disappointing, but on the whole, likeable. George and Nina Banks are in for the surprise of their lives when they find themselves middleaged and expecting their third child.  The timing is impeccable as Annie Banks-MAckenzie also realizes that she is expecting. Thus Steve MArtin embarks on a nine month journey that will consist of him building a new room for the baby, watching his daughter become a woman and overdosing on sleeping pills.  Honestly, the film made me laugh hysterically and i shed a few tears at the bittersweet ending. 3 and 1/2 stars out of five. not bad for a sequel; as sequels go,this is film isn't too bad.i didn't think ti was quite as good as the first one,but it's not a bad effort.i didn't find it as funny,and some of Steve Martin's histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me.really,this one doesn't quite have the same sincerity as the first.through much of this movie,i was all too aware i was watching a movie,whereas with firs tone,i was drawn in,and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting.having said that,there are some bright spots.for,one,this movie is just as touching as the first.and Eugene levy has a great cameo.and there is still some fun to be had.even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above,i still think Father of the Bride II is a 7/10 George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in 1995. It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. 2.5 out of 5 stars. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. I loved it, but one thing bothered me...; I enjoyed this movie: Diane Keaton is my favourite actress, Steve Martin always makes me laugh and Martin Short is great, but I felt really sorry for Keaton having to pretend to be pregnant. She didn't seem to be enjoying it and when the Banks were at the hospital, she actually looked rather bored, because whenever she spoke from the moment George protested about the doctor's name, she almost made it sound like she was in a maths lesson. Apart from that, it was great! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching Martin, Keaton or Short in a movie or who likes to laugh. 9/10 because of the little problem, but it was great. I loved it. Better than the original; This one is definitely better than the original, funnier, smoother pace, and in some places, better acting! Plus Martin Short has more screen time. Great! This is a great movie for anyone who like good clean comedy. Awesome! Five out of Five Moose Stars! Father of the Bride Part II; The first film was the remake of the original version starring Spencer Tracy and Dame Elizabeth Taylor, and it became very popular, so naturally they felt like a sequel was needed to continue the story. Basically George Banks (Golden Globe nominated Steve Martin) is getting used to the fact that his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) has become the bride now wife and got married to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), and more surprisingly a mother when she reveals she is pregnant. With this revelation comes out George has a small midlife crisis, and he tries to recapture his youth, including dying his hair, but he does eventually settle somewhat and get used to the idea that he will be a grandfather. But then he is shocked to find out he will be a father again as well when his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) reveals that she is also pregnant, and it may appear that both her and Annie's baby will be born on the same day. With these things happening, and the house having leaks and termites there is the opportunity to change things by selling the house to Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy), but he changes his mind later. When George manages to get the house back, despite a higher price, he gets the help of camp wedding planner/coordinator, now interior designer, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) to make the baby rooms and get things ready for the arrival of children. There are a couple of false alarms from Annie where she thinks the baby is coming, but eventually it comes to the real thing, and they rush to hospital, and of course Nina goes in to labour as well. In the end George is very happy to be holding both his new baby son and his new baby granddaughter is his arms, before his daughter and her husband move away to their own new home. Also starring Kieran Culkin as Matty Banks, B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein, Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie and Jane Adams as Dr. Megan Eisenberg. I can see what the critics mean by giving it two out of five stars in certain places, it certainly isn't as funny as the original film, it concentrates more on the sentimental material, but that's not a bad thing for this comedy drama. Okay! No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. AWESOME!; This movie is great!  I think it's one of the best movies ever made!  I love both Father of the Bride I and II!  I think that it is cute how they have the mother and daughter pregnant at the same time!  I hope that they come out with a Father of the Bride Part III, that would be awesome! :-) Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video Worthy second installment.; Mild SPOILERS are contained in the following comments. However, I believe everyone knows the story and how it turns out. The fun of the movie is seeing the actors, especially Martin. Steve Martin is back as George Banks, having just lost his daughter and basketball partner (Kimberly Williams as Annie ) to marriage, and now she is back home with her husband and a big announcement. She is pregnant. Of course everyone is happy, and the joy is doubled when Nina Banks (Diane Keaton as Annie's mom) finds out she is pregnant too. Poor George doesn't know if he can handle all this. After all, he is about to be a grandfather, he's not prepared to be a new father also. Martin Short is back as Franck Eggelhoffer, the unintelligible wedding planner. All ends well as both mom and daughter deliver their babies at the same time, in separate hospital rooms, so George has to go back and forth. The movie ends a few months later, and as Annie and her new baby are leaving, she gives dad a miniature basketball, a reminder to George that he can raise another basketball partner. Father of the Bride Part II; The 1991 Steve Martin comedy proved out to be popular enough to earn a sequel, much like the original Father of the Bride of 1950. All of the main cast of the first film returns in a story where the eponymous father George Banks (Martin) has gotten over the stressful wedding of his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) and her fiancé Bryan (George Newbern). However, when she breaks the big news about her pregnancy to the family, the grandpa-to-be becomes anxious about getting older and starts proving his youthfulness in various ways, such as selling the family's beloved house to a greedy real estate developer Habib (Eugene Levy). Life has more in store for George and his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) though, as it soon turns out that Annie's is not the only pregnancy in the family. Again, the humour is best when it relies on Steve Martin's comical talent and charisma instead of craziness and exaggeration. Unfortunately, adhering to the rule of always making sequels bigger and louder, the writers have given more screen time to the unbelievably annoying wedding planner Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) whose noisy and flamboyant scenes are certainly the weakest parts of the whole movie. The fussy bumbling caused by the impending childbirths at the end is also rather annoying and unimaginative. I think the movie works best during the more subtle scenes, such as Martin making uncomfortable faces while hiding his nervousness or arguing about the baby's surname with the overjoyed family during a dinner. Besides the run-of-the-mill jokes, the movie also shamelessly wallows in impenetrable sentimentalism of the newborns' adorability. Especially the music is so unbelievably schmaltzy that it was really getting on my nerves while watching; can't the filmmakers just trust their material's appeal without burying it under a sweety-tweety sugar mountain? Nevertheless, despite the predictability of the plot and the not-so-hilarious jokes, George Banks is a very likable character and Steve Martin is at home in the role, so those who enjoyed the first movie will probably like this one too  the basic building blocks of the story have not been changed at all. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. This is my favorite movie; ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is my favorite movie.  I think it is funny, sweet, and truly touches the heart.  In the sequel to the previous, Father of the Bride, George Banks (Steve Martin) is finally getting over the fact that his beloved daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams)has gotten married.  But then she shocks him with the news that she is pregnant.  Everyone else is thrilled, but George is not.  He believes that he is too young to be a grandfather.  He tries to become young, but doesn't succeed.  Then, both he and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton) are shocked to find out that Nina is also pregnant.  George now thinks he is too old to be a father.  They have one other child other then Annie, Matty (Kieren Culkin.)  Through the chaotic turns of pregnancy, George learns to except the fact that his daughter has grown up and moved on, even though it is hard.  They also have to deal with Fronk (Martin Short,) the goofy wedding coordinator from the first movie, who is now designing the new baby's room.  They then discover that Annie has been given the opportunity to design a museaum in Boston, far away from their own, San Marino, California.  George now realizes that he will miss his daughter more then ever, but he learns to get along.  In the end, he enjoys being a grandfather to baby George, and a father again, to Megan, named after the doctor who delievered her.  In this funny and heartwarming sequel, everyone puts out fantastic performences once again.  Even though I very much enjoy Father of the Bride, I enjoy this much more. And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW2, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. Loved it!!; I thought the sequel to the first Father of the Bride just showed what a great chemistry Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, George Newbern, and Kieran Culkin, along with all the other supporting actors have together. I would actually love to see a Father of the Bride Part III and I usually hate more and more sequels. I really do enjoy this sequel and I think it is better than the first one. I would reccommend any and everyone seeing this movie (but not without seeing the first one). Not bad...but could have been better; The first time I saw Father of the Bride 2 I really liked it.  I still enjoy watching some parts of it but I thought some realistic parts in the movie were not necessary.  First of all, the mother and daughter pregnant together.  This could happen but probably when the mother is not older than 40.  Nina had to be at least 47.  Is it likely that the mother would be pregnant at that age? I don't think so.  Secondly, I could not understand why George and Nina wanted the baby to have two last names.  Children always go by their father's last name and I thought Brian's father made a good observation when he said that George and Nina already had Matt to carry on the Banks name.  So why they thought the baby should have two last names is beyond me.  In conclusion, Father of the Bride 2 is still cute and fun to watch in some parts but I thought the first one was much better Heartwarming & Hilarious; Steve Martin does it again in this touching and funny sequel to 1991's Father Of The Bride the rest of the cast returns in a new story dealing with the joys of parenthood. I loved Father Of The Bride II not only because it was funny, mostly it was due to the comic antics of a man dealing with two pregnancies at once. He's a great comedian as well as an on screen father, my favorite scene is when both babies arrive at the same time. A year has passed since George Banks (Martin) watched his only daughter Annie (Williams) get married and has accepted her transformation from daughter to wife. She comes home with her husband Brian (Newbern) to announce the wonderful news to her parents, brother Matty (Culkin) and in-laws that she's pregnant. Everyone is thrilled and excited except for George who thinks he's too young to be a grandpa, from then on he tries to act young by dying his hair and exercising. But things are about to get a little crazy when his loving wife Nina (Keaton)discovers she's pregnant too now George must deal with the impending arrival of both his grandchild and his own child. Thrown into the chaos is Franck Eggelhoffer (Short) the wedding coordinator who helps to design a room for the new addition to the Banks family. This movie is not only sweet but it's charming entertainment for fans of all ages. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. 5/10 A really likable comedy.; I enjoyed this film. I found that it was easy to relate to Steve Martin's character George Banks as a parent. The relationship between him and his daughter Annie, played by Kimberly Williams, was an honest father daughter relationship. I recommend this one for parents in general and empty nesters in particular. The idea of a mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time is plausible and amusing. A Well-Done Sequel!; A sequel to immensely likable Father of the Bride, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is A Well-Done Sequel! Its enjoyable as well as emotional! 'Father of the Bride Part II' Synopsis: George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. 'Father of the Bride Part II' is worthy sequel of a wonderful prequel. The characters still appeal, the humor works & the emotional moments are heartfelt as well. Nancy Meyers & Charles Shyer's Screenplay is genuinely well-done. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography & Editing are fair. Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains. On the whole, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is a satisfying sequel. Some of Martin's best work!; First, this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2. If run back to back, they run like one beautiful story. This production is great from start to finish. Everything about it is wonderful, including the story, the acting performances and the direction. This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor. His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances. He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man. This movie is no exception. His performance is comedic, yet startlingly genuine. Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's. I love this movie. I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character; with how he feels, and what he's going through. This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum, and I love it. It's less about family, and more about life's curves; the every-day things that make us crazy, happy, sad, and ultimately stronger. It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think, consider, ponder the events which have led us to where we are now. Combined, they rate 8.6/10 from... the Fiend :. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late '40's)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... daughter gets married; In the sequel to Father of the Bride we have the daughter getting married and moving away from home, this presents a big dilemma to the father played of course by Steve Martin. Maybe not quite as funny as the first one,, or as good,, but definitely above average,, it's always a pleasure watching Steve Martin work at his craft. The movie is basically about how the family,, especially the parents deal with their young daughter growing up,, getting married, and eventually moving away from the nest.. the cameo from Eugene Levy is just wonderful,, as a real estate agent who is trying to sell the very home where our main character lives.. all in all a very family friendly movie,, that I would recommend. Not as good as the first, but good family fun; This movie is as thin as you can get. Its' emotions are easily played. There are no surprises. It is very predictable. And I say...so what? What is wrong with that? This is an American Dream movie. Everything goes perfectly and everyone is as happy as can be. Why should it be a complicated character study? It deals with the birth of babies. There's no complex feelings that need to be dealt with in this situation. A life is being created. A family is being blessed. A baby's birth is a time for love and hope. This movie has both in spades. It's a very positive movie that shows the joy a new baby brings. Every parent-to-be should watch it. A child's birth is an emotional event with no equal. This movie knows it and milks it for all its' worth. My only complaint is it should have been called Parents of the Bride. Way too much time is spent with the relationship between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. There should have been more attention paid to Kimberly Williams. Not only were the scenes between her and Martin the best scenes in this and the original, but Kimberly Williams is the most beautiful actress to come out of Hollywood in many years. Forget all the blond, silicone filled, bimbos that every teenage boy raves about. Ms. Williams is a natural beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****. Like Cliches?; ...That weren't even funny the first time? I've seen a lot of films with Steve Martin in them, and they all made me laugh.  Until this one. Part one is worth a look..it may make you laugh a couple of times (I think I laughed once).  But I recommend avoiding this one all together. Deja Vu; I found this sequel to be both charming and entertaining. What I learned tonight is that this movie is actually a remake of the 1951 movie \"Father's Little Dividend\", which in turn was the sequel to the original \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and with the same great cast: Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Bennett, et al.  They both share the same broad comedy and story line (only one pregnancy in the earlier version though), and in their own ways are equally entertaining.  Old or new incarnations, however, be sure to see parts one and two in sequence. Not exactly the most innovative of films, but still great fun!; This is an excellent, funny, warming film. Although a lot of the \"same kind of thing\" was done in the first movie, it's still entertaining. Steve Martin's character was good, although at times his behaviour is quite pathetic and Martin Short is again entertaining. (Particularly his pronunciation of the word 'pregnant).' Although it's highly predictable and not the most intellectually stimulating of films it is still well worth watching and the vast majority of people would enjoy this film. Not bad, but inferior to the first; I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the first movie. It was not without sentiment and it was hardly original, but it was still beautifully filmed, well acted, charming and funny. This sequel is not as good as the first I agree, but I still quite enjoyed it. The story is predictable, and there are some so-so parts in the script. Eugene Levy, who I do like by the way, is okay here but his character felt somewhat unnecessary and felt like he was there as an additional character and to give the film a longer length. And I also would have liked to have seen more of Kimberley Williams, she is so beautiful and quite a good actress, but I actually do agree that a little too much time is spent between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. However, it is beautifully filmed, has a nice soundtrack, decent pacing and good direction. And the acting is fine too, Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are still very likable, and while as I've said I would have liked to have seen more of her Kimberley Williams was lovely. And I loved Martin Short here too, he was one of the main merits of the first film, so to see him in his wonderfully fluffy turn again was a very nice surprise. Overall, not bad at all, could have been better, but I liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox A so so sequel; 'Father of the bride' was a good film and probably didn't need a sequel. But this is Hollywood, everything needs a sequel. While it is clear that a lot of effort has gone into making this sequel work, the central idea stretches credibility and every idea the writer had seems to have been thrown at the wall in a desperate attempt to get laughs. There are moments that remind you of the heart and humour that the preceding film had, but it's a load of nothing really. I went into this film dubious about how good it could be, and I didn't finish watching it any more convinced that the original needed a sequel. Pretty much just a rehash of the first; As this movie started, it reminded me a lot of the first. Various scenes were reenacted, only a little wackier, sort of like it was trying to be a shade more funny than the first; I guess that is the usual stuff for this type of sequels, but I think it failed at that. Apart from that, the movie pretty much succeeds in being a good sequel to the first. The story is also somewhat reminiscent of the first one. All the same actors return as well, and they are pretty much the same, just a shade more wacky. The story is also told by Steve Martins character, George Banks, like in the first. Pretty much everything in the movie is a takeoff of the first; this doesn't make it bad though, if you liked the first, liked the characters, you'll want to see this too, if nothing else, to see the characters again. It is about as funny and as sentimental as the first was, and as enjoyable. Fans of the first one, or of Steve Martin will most likely enjoy at least some part of it, as this is the typical for both the first movie and Steve Martin. 7/10 Better than the first one!; I love Steve Martin, but I was disappointed by the first movie, so I wasn't expecting as much from this one.  But to my surprise, this one was even better! It's constantly funny, just like one should expect from Steve Martin; it's not preoccupied with corny emotion, like the first movie was. It's Steve Martin in his best performance since \"My Blue Heaven.\" Sometimes sequels can be surprisingly good.  This one is better.  It has all the comedic elements that were stagnant in the first movie.  It's everything the first movie should have been, and more!  "

       "      <td>Overhyped, over praised, and just plain dull....; Yes people, I will dare to come out as the perhaps only person to truly hate this film.  While the animation is groundbreaking to say the least, it doesn't mean that it has a story to back it up.  I for one love cartoon movies, but this left a sour taste in  my mouth.  Maybe it's because in what is supposed to be a kids' movie, we see one character trying to \"off\" another character, out of pure jealousy.  The other toys were just annoying as the chorus, as they, like the leads, had a total lack of any real character.  There were some bad attempts at humor that didn't even win a giggle out of me or my family. Skip it and see Shrek or Ice Age.  Better stories to balance the animation. An unmissable film; From our first sight of Woody until his happy face disappears off of the screen the makers of this film keep audiences worldwide glued to the screen with eager anticipation. The films unlikely scenario where talking toys battle to save a fellow toys life is amazingly gripping and a \"must see\" which will keep the whole family (yes even the teenageers) amused. The more mature audience will recognise the \"spoofy\"side to the movie. This is most noticeable when plastic soldiers (who mimic the actors in \"Who saves wins\") jump off  bannisters with miniature parachutes and talk to each through baby monitering systems.!!! In conclusion, TOY STORY is one of the most thought out films in the industry as props and scenerycan not just be found lying around and everything had to be individually designed, crafted and computerised To Infinity and Beyond!; It was May of 1991, and Disney were on the brink of the Animation Renaissance which would bring about a treasure-trove of beautifully drawn and designed 2D films. Only a few months later would the first and very elegant Beauty and The Beast be released. But behind the scenes, they negotiated a deal with a small animation studio named Pixar, previously only animating shorts to demonstrate the capabilities of their computers. John Lasseter would serve as director after being fired from Disney as he pitched the revolutionary idea of the first ever fully computer animated full length feature film. And so Toy Story was born. It was a long and complicated production process full of worries about budget, and the infamous Black Friday reveal which prompted a production shut-down and a full script revamp. It's sequel would later nearly undergo a disaster of similar scale. But after an arduous process Toy Story became a ground breaking film in animation history and set the first benchmark for 3D animation. Toy Story is a beautifully rendered film for its time and eye poppingly gorgeous. Pixar's revolutionary animation process created a living breathing world with every tiny detail lovingly crafted - blades of grass, hairs on head, scuffs on floorboards. The character movement is smooth and seamless, the use of light and shadow realistic. Being Pixar's first ever feature film and under close scrutiny from Disney executives and given a small budget, short cuts like ponytails and short hair were used, and the textures of the background and minor characters are less visually impressive, but Tory Story still holds up remarkably well decades later. It's all wrapped in a stirring score by Randy Newman which easily accompanies the film's movement; lifting for Buzz's first take-off, eerily tip-toeing at the Spaceport Arcade. The main song You've Got a Friend in Me is heartfelt at the start of the film but even more-so at the end, Newman duetting with Lyle Lovett to symbolise the new partnership of Buzz and Woody. The story is a simple but universal one, with an original twist. What happens when toys are alive, and furthermore, what happens when they are replaced by newer, cooler models? The titular characters of Buzz and Woody are stunningly brought to life through fantastic character design and voice-acting. Woody is your classic Western cowboy with a pull string that spouts recorded catchphrases while Buzz Lightyear is a futuristic Space Ranger who has pop-out wings and a laser. Who can compete with that? Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide a great deal of emotion and character through their respective portrayals; in particular Woody's charm and leadership is a thin veneer for his insecurity and ego which is displayed when Andy gets a newer toy. Terry Gilliam singles out a great shot at the height of Buzz's personality as a Space Ranger, where he discover he is actually just a toy, and where the camera zooms out and the big bravado he was only a moment earlier is now a tiny figure. But apart from them you have a whole cast of iconic characters each with their quirks, personalities and traits; Mr Potato Head, Re the dinosaur, Slinky Dog, Hamm the piggy bank, Bo Peep, the plastic toy soldiers...We get the sense that these toys have been in the Andy household forever, and have formed a tight knit family and well-oiled hierarchy. the sequel 4 years later gives them additional screen-time which comes with more laughs (including the addition of Mr Potato Head's wife). Toy Story set the first benchmark for computer animation and heralded a period of critical and box office success for Pixar. The 2 sequels are also crafted with as much detail and care as the first, but nothing can match the first gasps of wonder and amazement at the movement and freedom of the 3D world when it first hit cinemas in 1995. An affectionate love letter to toys and film; This was Pixar's first feature-length film, the first full-length computer-animated feature film and the first film in the Toy Story series. There will be spoilers ahead: I could just say that this is a phenomenal film, a ground-breaking film and a must watch if you love film in general and/or animation in particular and leave it at that, but this comment would be rather thin if I did so, so I'll do a bit more here. I don't really need to discuss the plot, because, chances are, if you're reading this, you've probably seen this already. I'll do a brief sketch: this concerns a boy named Andy and his toys. Lifeless when humans are around, the toys come to life when none are in the room. Woody is the leader of the toys, but his place is threatened by a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. Andy and family are preparing to move. Through a series of mishaps, Woody and Buzz wind up being lost and must make their way back before the family leaves or be separated from Andy forever. After a series of adventures, they make it back and get on board before the family is gone. That's a simple story. The parts of the film are each so excellently crafted that it takes a simple story and creates gold. The animation still holds up, even after 20 years, which is an eternity in computer animation. The script is marvelous and the writers clearly show that they possess a love for both toys and film. The toys showing up in here are a mix of new (Woody and Buzz) and classic (Mr. Potatohead, Etch-a-Sketch and green army soldiers). There are gags referencing films as diverse as Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Wizard of Oz. Pixar also references the various shorts they'd made up to that point and TV shows like Star Trek and The Simpsons. The voice casting is spot on. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen nailed their parts. Don Rickles and Jim Varney were inspired casting choices and John Ratzenberger began an association with Pixar which continues today. The score and songs by Randy Newman are perfect, particularly the song, \"You've Got a Friend In Me\", which goes to the heart of the film. It's just an exceptional film. The attention to detail is incredible. Even minor characters turn out to have a significant influence on things, like the mutant toys in Sid's bedroom (Sid and his dog Scud are the villains here, Sid being a rather twisted kid next door). The look of everything is astonishing, though it has aged in 20 years. This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray is is well worth getting. Most highly recommended. The first of it's kind.; Toy story is the first Pixar animated film. Toy story amazed everyone on earth back in 1995 and still does to this day. That amazes us and so does Pixar. Bringing us some of the best films of our time. Nowadays we have Up, Ratatouille, Wall E, Finding Nemo. The list goes on. But we should remember the first one. Toy story stars Tim Allen and Tom Hanks as Toys. Hanks plays Woody, a cowboy toy who is the most popular from his owner Andy. That all changes when Andy buys a toy called Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen) who is an astronaut. Woody becomes awfully jealous and tries everything in his power to get rid of Buzz. There are other plot points that I would rather not go into. Toy story creeps me out a little. The thing about it that creeps me out is the villain named Sid. Sid is this toy murderer who lives next door to Andy and the toy gang. There is a part in the end when all of the toys retaliate. That part scares me every time. Watching these destroyed toys retaliate. I never thought something like that could creep me out. I guess I get creeped too easily. The first Toy story is a work of art. It's got great visuals and will creep you out. Kind of like Robert Zemeckis' A Christmas carol, which is another work of art I think. As I have said in many reviews, Toy story is a film that you'll never forget. I haven't. My memory is crap. Toy story:****/**** The first one will be remembered the most; The movie isn't just the first one in the Toy Story series, but also the first movie Pixar ever created and they didn't waste any time showing us what they could do. This movie shows what being creative is all about. The soul ingredient of the story is simply what happens when your toys are left alone and the benefits (and downfalls) of being a toy. But what amazes me the most is the emotional connection that it gives to anyone at any age and what keeps it together is the friendship between toys, even though they are only toys, the movie easily grasps the emotions of 2 people turned into best friends. Of course sometime in the future another animated movie will have the same success or more than Toy Story and may even beat it. But Toy Story will always be remembered as the first, and never will be forgotten. Best Toy Story Movie; This movie is funny, hilarious, humorous1 It makes the whole wide world wanna laugh! This movie is so funny, you'd laugh your butt off! I liked it how Sid scared his sister but messing up her toys. I wish I can do what he does to the Animal Crossing players! They make me sick because they suck more than Justin Bieber. Also, it's funny how Woody murdered Buzz! Also Bo Peep reminds me of Princess Peach from the Super Mario series. She should have appeared in the other Toy Story movies. I can't believe they screwed up on Toy Story 3, one of the worst Toy Story movies ever! I hope they don't ever screw up Toy Story 4, which comes out next year. Wonderful animated feature...; TOY STORY is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. It goes along with TOY STORY 2, TARZAN, A BUG'S LIFE, THE LION KING and CHICKEN RUN as some of my favorite animated features. Tom Hank s voices Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll owned by a boy named Andy who is the most-played toy until a space ranger, Buzz (Tim Allen) comes along and Woody is not good friends with them. But one day later, a mean toy-hating man who owns a collection of mutant toys and tries to threaten Buzz, and it is up to Woody to save Buzz with the help of the mutants before it's too late to escape to Andy's new house. The sequel is better than the original, but TOY STORY is a good movie. **** What Makes a Toy a Toy?; Marvellously inventive, brilliantly rendered, perfectly paced, adorably characterized CGI gem with a sinister edge to its witty and intelligent storyline. The voice cast is a pleasure to behold and the toy figures are instantly likable. The alternation between action-packed moments, laugh-out-loud gags and scenes of emotional, downright existential crises offers a deeper viewing experience anyone could've hoped for. Despite two well-made sequels, this one's still the best installment of the much-loved franchise. 8 out of 10 freak toys Another Childhood Favorite!!!; I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since. It has a great storyline. Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, and many more. On Andy's Birthday, he receives a Buzz Lightyear action hero, and Woody becomes jealous because he isn't Andy's favorite anymore. When Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, his friends want nothing to do with him. On the way to Pizza Planet, Buzz confronts him in the family van, and knocks him outside and the family drive off without them. They go through a lot trying to get back to Andy before they move. When they end up in Sid's room, the kid who tortures toys, Woody and Buzz must work together in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TOY STORY!!! A pioneer; You may or may not like \"Toy Story\", but there's something that's perfectly clear: it changed for good the animation cinema. Pixar were pioneers not only in the world of 3D animation but also in offering products that might entertain children and adults. I do prefer movies such as \"Antz\" or \"Shrek\", but I think \"Toy story\" is so funny as well. Anyway, we can't avoid the \"Disney touch\" and all those awful songs... So, after \"Toy story\" came other movies that were much better, but this was the first one and it has a relevant position in the history of cinema. *My rate: 6/10 Really Sweet Movie!; Whether you're a fan of animated Disney movies or not, this movie is brilliant! It's great for family time movies or great for the everyday average Disney fan. The characters are put together very well. After I saw it, it made me actually think about throwing out old toys. I've been a fan of this movie ever since I was born(it was really big then) and I still watch it from time to time. I would definitely recommend this to anybody. Great fun for anyone; Toy Story is definitely a film that a kid should watch before they are a teen. Its adventure and great sense of humour is appealing to adult audiences as well, and the atmosphere is brilliant. This really is a Toy Story. The plot is indeed quite simple, and it would have to be for a classic family. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks)is a toy 'sheriff' doll, owned by a young boy called Andy. Woodys Toy life couldn't as Andy loves him a lot, but as Andy's birthday party arises tension fills the bedroom with each toy living in fear of being replaced. Everything goes well till the last birthday present is opened.. enter Buzz Lightyear! I would be criminal to tell you the rest of the story, but as far as humour and adventure are concerned, this film impresses in both categories. The toys different personalities really contrast and make you laugh, from the smart-chat of Mr. Potatoe head, to Slinky who is Woodys best toy friend. Its so easy to follow this film - the plot and characters are easy to watch the computer graphics are top notch. Compared to modern day CGI kids films, this stands out purely because of its innocence - a simple story, theirs no techno-babble, and its really fun. This truly is the film of the Nineties! The best film for big adults...; It's too bad the first user comment was that this is the best film for small children.  It's not just for kids!  My husband and I were 35 and childless when we first saw this.  We took a chance and purchased it before we saw it. After viewing it for the first time, we immediately watched it again.  It was if we had been on a really fun ride, and had to get back in line again. And fun is the operative word.  What a fun movie.  It's what I look for in a movie - something that takes you away from the cares of the world for a little while and makes you feel good.  Kind of like a drug without adverse after-affects. A catalyst in the field of computer animation; This was the first feature film that was done entirely by computers, and Pixar couldn't have done a better job. Not only is this movie hilarious, touching, and well plotted, but it lead the way for every other computer animated movie, and really set the bar high. If this movie had completely bombed there would no more, or at least not as many, CGI films and we would still be seeing drawn animation. Not to mention that the absolute perfect voice talents were cast to make such a memorable movie for kids and adults and teens and preteens and seniors and new borns or anybody else who eyes and hears or either or. This movie can not me avoided and is a cultural landmark that has opened the door for a completely new genre of movie making. My favorite film as a kid and remains a classic today; As a kid, I remember watching the first two Toy Story films frequently and collecting all the characters from the movie. I found out that it was the very first computer-animated film about two years ago and assumed that's why the movie is still so popular. Woody and Buzz are what made the film what it was then and today and were my favorite characters. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is where Woody and Buzz are launched in the air from the rocket and Buzz frees himself to fly into Andy's toy box. The film remains a classic and always will be to me. I also cannot wait for the third movie to come out June 18, 2010 because I'll be the first in line. Toy Story is the greatest Disney movie ever in my opinion! Looking forward to Toy Story 3 in two years!; There is absolutely no question about it, Disney/Pixar's 1995 hit film, Toy Story, is their absolutely best film in my opinion. Pixar, the visual effects studio based in Northern California, was best known for making short films with three dimensional technology, including some Oscar winning shorts. In 1992 a script called Toy Story was completed and Pixar decided to take on the challenge of creating the world's first fully computer animated motion picture. In 1995, that script came to life, and the rest is history. Not only was Toy Story a gigantic hit for Disney and Pixar, it started series of films that continues to amaze and bewilder children and adults of all ages. The animation was state of the art, and continues to look amazing to this day. The characters, Woody, and Buzz Lightyear, to the humor were all amazing. Pixar won a special Oscar for making the first computer animated film, and it led to many more films of it's type to this day. Pixar, don't make us wait, please give millions of children around the world what we desperately need, more adventures of Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Here's to many more Toy Story films in the future, including the upcoming Toy Story 3 coming in three years, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen returning as Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Why the trailer, why?; I remember seeing all the trailers for this movie and thinking, \"Uggh, how stupid.  Why do they make movies like this?\"  This was when I was in my macho mood.  Ya know, I've outgrown all this animated c%^p.  That was my attitude, so, of course, I avoided this movie for 4 years.  Just last year, Pokemon kinda broke me out of my \"macho mode\" and brought me back to those simple pleasures.  Taught me not to hide the child in me.  So, my mom says we're taking care of my little cousin and wants to know if there's a movie out that we could see.  I mentioned Toy Story 2 (he and I already saw Pokemon, the most underrated movie of '99), but hadn't seen the first one.  So, I drove over to his house to watch Toy Story.  Man, what I was missing.  This is a terrific movie, but not because of the great animation.  The animation is cool, but like I've said, don't be that superficial that you judge the movies completely on animation.  It's the characters that matter, and this one had great characters.  Something that everyone must see. The Best Kids Movie of the 90's; Despite being the first full-length computer-animated movie, the movie's strengths are its plot and characterization.  The technology is not thrust in your face and simply serves to support a truly excellent animated film. A classic. Cool A MUST see; I saw this movie when i was 5 years old a long time ago and I was so obsessed with Buzz Lightyear! I had toys of buzz Lightyear and carried them around anywhere i went.I saw this movie yesterday again and it was fabulous! plain fabulous. The story was amazing and the characters were well made! Nice job Pixar, You done it again! Tom Hanks did well doing a voice of Woody and same with Tim Allen with Buzz. I didn't really like Wall.E i almost fell asleep but this movie kept me awake the whole time with excitement! I recommend this movie to anyone no matter what age you are because this movie Just Beautiful! An fantastic awesome 10/10 very good songs; this has some of my favourite songs ever to be used for an animated film: Strange Things and You've Got a Friend in Need. the songs makes this now dated(!) film more original than Toy Story 2. The animation is fantastic and cutting-edge at the time. Also, it's only 6 years old now, the animation is still as impressive as it was back all those year ago. What else can I say. But this is 1990s equivalent to Snow White and the 7 dwarfs and,indeed, a lot better! Absolutely Love Toy Story!; Toy Story is an incredibly creative, fun film with a touching, heartfelt story. It is an awesome family film. The characters were brilliantly personified as they worked their way through their amazing adventures. The brilliant creativity of the characters and background layout is evident throughout the entire film; the background layout and lighting is fantastic. Each character has it's own vivid personality that was expressed with such unique individualism, additionally each character makes the viewer care for them. The story's continuity is definitely balanced with the awesome visual effects. The movie keeps the viewers' attention throughout it's entirety, with the twists, turns and suspenseful predicaments. The film also lends fun filled moments with many jokes/funny lines and expressions from the characters, while simultaneously allowing the viewers' hearts to reach out to the characters as they are tangled in many of the zany situations they encounter.

It's a very cute movie, mainly for kids, but it has a few chuckles thrown in for adults. The human characters in the movie didn't seem very realistic; their happy-go-lucky, suburban lifestyle just made them very flat and barely likable, especially if you grew up in a family unable to afford multiple toys. The voice actors were delightful, and their moods were directed very well, even for the plastic Army-men who don't show much emotion. The \"cannibal toys\" were very imaginative and creepy, so they served their purpose well. I thought the idea of the claw machine that housed the little green aliens was cute, how \"The Claw\" was their Messiah of sorts. The coloring in the film was vivid and incorporated some awesome day-glow tones that I had forgotten about over time. The ultimate reason to watch the movie is to witness Pixar's astounding use of 3D imagery, especially when they incorporate real-life effects onto the screen (i.e. The magnifying lens over Woody's face). There were some aspects of the film I didn't care for. The movie is only 77 minutes long without the prefaced, short 3D movie before it, making the story suffer and seem a little lacking. I found the music to be over-the-top schmaltzy and generic, but it is primarily for kids and the Disney crowd, so I guess it belongs here. Again, the character of Andy isn't very likable, other than the fact that he owns a lot of older toys that we made have seen commercials of as a kid. The story wasn't very mind-blowing, but from the vantage point of a toy on the run, it is imaginative enough. It's the typical Indiana Jones setting where the main characters always find a way to turn their two-steps forward into one-step back. The ending with the falling through the sunroof was very convenient and could've easily been the start of another obstacle they needed to face, for example. In the end, I like the movie for its presentation, but as a film, I was not blown away with originality or anything by its story. The messages that it sends about jealousy, envy, depression, fear, and questions about one's worthiness to another are the primary focuses throughout the movie, but it ends up just being another nicely tied-up package in the end, which is Disney for you. 5 stars. Created a decade ago, but still stunning; I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago. The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their \"leader\" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other... When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10. very funny; a great movie to watch with your children. this is a movie the whole family will enjoy. we watch this movie over and over. our thirteen year old likes it as much as my three year old, i like it just as much as they do. Tears....; Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library. \"I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films.\"; Toy Story  5/5 stars Children play with toys. It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc",
       " But what if toys were real? What if they could talk? Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, 'Toy Story,' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks). Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy's birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one? I'll give you a hint: 'Cheers'). But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid's house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy's house safely. 'Toy Story' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in 'Toy Story,' filling our minds with endless possibilities. What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn't just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar managed to preach to us 'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film 'Toy Story.' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real? What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities? An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you've got yourself one of the best films ever. Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll's expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good. The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy). The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing. I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had. Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made  something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.' 'Toy Story' 1 &amp; 2 are both on my 'favorite films' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would 'Monsters Inc.' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar's upcoming film 'Finding Nemo,' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films  not sequels  by 2005), they should definitely try to make a 'Toy Story 3.' I'll be first in line for it, anyway. Cute Family Movie; Toy Story is a great movie for children and adults. Children will enjoy it simply because it is a cartoon. They will find it exciting because it shows toys coming to life which is something every child pretends with their toys. It's a good movie for children because it teaches them about jealousy, friendship, and teamwork. Adults will appreciate the animation and the accuracy of the details in the toys. Most of the toys used in this film were ones most people had as children. Such as, Mr. Potato head, the slinky dog, etch-a-sketch, and the army men. The theme of Toy Story is friendship. The movies theme song was titled \"You've Got a Friend in Me\". The friendship in this movie is about overlooking insecurities and finding a true friend in someone that you think would be your biggest enemy. A 2001 movie called Monsters Inc. is directed around this same theme. A little girl named Boo should be afraid of the monsters as much as the monsters are afraid of her but they form a friendship that overcomes their differences. Toy Story is about the lives of toys owned by a boy named Andy. Andy is having a birthday and he gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear. Andy's toys worry about him getting new toys because they are afraid they will get lost or donated. With the arrival of Buzz, Woody fills that Andy will like Buzz better. He tries to lose Buzz but instead he accidentally knocks him out of a window. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were brilliantly matched for being the voices of Woody and Buzz Lightyear. The personalities of the actors and characters seemed to be a perfect fit. The other toys in the movie, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky dog (Jim Varney), Pig named Ham(John Ratzenberger), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), and Bo Peep(Annie Potts), feel like Woody did this on purpose because he was jealous of the attention Buzz was getting from Andy. In order to make things right Woody realizes he needs to get Buzz back. Woody and Buzz both wind up separated from Andy and this is where their adventure begins. From this point on they work together to get back to Andy's before his family moves. Along the way Buzz realizes that he is not a space ranger but a toy. Woody tries to help Buzz understand that he is not just a toy and that he is very important to children. Woody convinces Buzz that they must get back to Andy. At the conclusion of the movie, Buzz and Woody are helping each other make it on the moving truck. They finally make it next to Andy who is excited to see both of them. Toy Story is about the friendship that is formed between Woody and Buzz. Once Woody was able to get passed his insecurities he realized that Andy could have two favorite toys. The motif of friendship is displayed throughout the movie by the relationships between Woody and Andy, Woody and all the other toys, and between Woody and Buzz. They also form a friendship with the strange toys at Sid's house. This movie is a true example of friendship. A Monumental Achievement in the Cinema; \"Toy Story\" is a real sight to behold because it is the first feature-length, computer-animated film.  Once you get passed the amazing visual effects, you see a really great film that works because of interesting characters and a second-to-none screenplay.  Even the roughest of critics would have trouble finding problems with this winner.  5 stars out of 5. Revolutionary. A fierce work of genius.; I don't necessarily like G-rated movies, but I make this one an exception. This movie is just great (it was the biggest moneymaker of 1995, and rightly so). I think that \"Toy Story\" appeals to kids and adults alike 'cause it's so funny, fast, and exhilarating. No one had done anything like this before; it was such a huge earthquake in the movie industry. It was also the world's first completely CG-animated movie. I can especially identify with Rex 'cause we're both nervous at times (except it's not from an inferiority complex), and we both like video games. This is easily one of my most favorite movies. \"An instant classic for all ages\". Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie; I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about. Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys. The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys. Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film. What a movie; Wow, I remember back in 1995 when I first saw this movie back in 1995. I think it was the movie being the farthest away that I could remember in theaters, and I saw it like two or three times. At first, I thought it was something about these toys trying to get to another group of toys, and they were a big group themselves. I couldn't believe how amazing the plot was. After I saw that movie it was like I couldn't get enough of Toy Story stuff. The characters were cool as well, and they just all seemed to be in the right places at the right time, like Mr. Potato Head, especially. And I had waited for years for a Toy Story 2 to come out, and after four years of waiting, it finally happened! And it was an excellent sequel! The extra fun in this movie, spotting the other toys that make cameos. It was kind of a simple plot that just worked, what with the rivalry between Woody and Buzz competing for Andy's favorite toy and the wisecracks of that pig, and Rex. I even got my own TS toys and such. It was truly a memorable movie. 10/10. Nice work, Disney and Pixar! Classic Pixar! This is what future Pixar films should be like!; Remember the original Pixar movies? Remember when Pixar didn't have stereotypical surfers and rappers? It was when the characters were fun and familiar. They didn't waste out time with farting jokes, but instead had smart jokes that weren't overdone. (even if they were more geared towards adults.) Luckily, we still have one good, classic Pixar movie; Toy Story. Peter Doctor knows how to make a fun and enjoyable family movie. Woody, is the \"top toy\" of Andy's bedroom. He leads meeting and events, and is one of the most popular toys there. But, then, Andy has a birthday party. Everybody is worried about getting replaced by a toy, but Woody assures them that there is nothing to be worried about. Funny, how he ends up getting replaced by Buzz Lightyear-the new popular toy. Ironic, huh? So, he gets jealous and tries to kill Buzz, by setting up a trap and pushing him out the window. Then, the other toys find out, and think \"Let's kill Woody!\" Wow, the irony in it all! The only way the toys will forgive him, is if he brings Buzz back. So, Woody and Buzz meet up at \"Pizza Palace.\" After exploring a bit, they get caught by Sid-the sick and twisted kid next door. But, what makes this movie so good? Toy Story isn't your average kids' film. It seems to have a message in it all. Two unlikely friends, Buzz and Woody hate each other at first. Then, they slowly learn trust each other, and stick together through thick and thin. Toy Story is perhaps one of those \"feel good\" movies. It's fun, and doesn't try to be anything it's not. Toy Story is an enjoyable, fun, and all-around excellent film. Be sure to put it on your \"To Watch\" list. 10/10 1995: Oh my God, is this real? 2016: Oh my God, what am I looking at?; Toy Story, as the first completely CGI animated movie, is still timeless in plenty of ways and is enjoyed by anyone who can say they like animation. I am one of them. The animation is of course crude by today's standards, but it was made in a way that makes it seem like 1995 wasn't that long ago. As dated as it looks, we can still appreciate it for being more than just a test of what computers could render. As for complaints, the jokes could have been funnier and the story could have less instances of convenience, like how Buzz and Woody enter the Pizza Planet Truck and come across a nice, high pile of pizza boxes to hide behind. There were also some errors in the anatomy of some toys, like RC. I won't take points off for the animation because hey, it was 1995 and Pixar had up to that point only been making shorts for 11 years, so it isn't something to grouch over (even though there were some superficial glitches like disappearing lights between scenes). All I can say is, see it soon and brace for a higher intrigue of the early history of CGI. Instant Classic; Every company has that one movie that puts them on the map. That is what Toy Story did for Pixar. Toy Story is a cartoon about a little boy's toy collection that is alive when the little boy is not around. His name is Andy and he loves his toys, and they love him back. Woody is a cowboy and is Andy's favorite toy. The toys always get worried every Christmas and birthday because they fear they will be replaced by a bigger and better toy. The story starts off with Andy's birthday party and all of the toys are on edge. It turns out that a new toy by the name of Buzz Lightyear challenges Woody as the favorite toy. Buzz comes along, steals a little bit of the spotlight and Woody gets incredibly jealous. Eventually Woody and Buzz get lost and must find their way home and back to Andy before he and his family move away forever. Let's start with the toys. I loved these toys. Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Little Bow Peep, Woody, Buzz, Slink, Ham, and even Etch-a-Sketch are the main toys and each are lovable and different. Rex is hilarious because he is ironic. He is a dinosaur but he is a wimp, and he is my favorite of the toys. I remember watching as a little kid and I was always excited to see Rex on screen. Each character has their individual role. There are also toys every kid can relate with and that make the movie special. For example, the barrel of monkeys, the small soldiers, the etch-a-sketch, and Mr. Potato Head are toys every kid used to play with. The smaller toys aren't really relevant for long but when they are seen in the beginning and end of the movie their impact is huge. One of the major themes in the story is jealousy and the relationship between Woody and Buzz. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the favorite toy. Woody is a cowboy with a pull string that says some catch phrases. The other toys look up to him, he is a hero, and Andy loved him with all his heart. Andy dresses up like a cowboy, has Woody posters, and is obsessed with this toy. Woody embraces the love; it defines him, gives him confidence, and confirms that he is the leader. Then Buzz Lightyear comes into the picture with his better quality of a toy. He doesn't have a pull string, but a button Andy presses to have a better sound quality voice box will speak catch phrases. He is made of plastic, which is more durable and he has wings pop out which can simulate flight. Woody becomes incredibly jealous of Buzz and fights for Andy's love. He eventually knocks him out the window. Toy Story may be a kid's movie but it has an interesting and entertaining premise, especially with its characterization. Woody and Buzz both develop into better and stronger characters. Woody goes from a pompous, jealous, selfish, toy, into a respectable and lovable character. He and Buzz become best friends and inseparable, a little cliché, but it's a movie for families so it's perfect. When Buzz first appeared he thought he was a real \"space ranger.\" He was convinced that he was not a toy, he could really fly, and he had a dangerous \"laser\" which was really a blinking light bulb. He develops and he eventually accepts the fact that he is a toy but he is a \"cool toy.\" He is \"Andy's toy.\" Woody admits his jealousy to Buzz and that becomes a turning point in their relationship. We have our villain in the movie, Sid. This kid is just evil. He is a spoiled kid who \"terrorizes toys, just for fun.\" One scene we the toys in Andy's room watch him as he straps firecrackers to a Commander Carl and it explodes. First of all, what kind of nine or ten year old kid plays with explosives? If he isn't nine or ten, what is he doing playing with kid toys? He may tear them apart and put different parts on them, making them scary and horrific for children to even see on screen, that just doesn't make sense. His character fits for a children's movie but in reality a kid like this would never exist in real life. Sid is really my only problem with the movie, but still a character needed for the film. Overall, Toy Story is a classic and put Pixar on the map and was the beginning of a highly successful company. It came out in the 1995 and families everywhere fell in love, including me. It is a movie that can be watched again and again no matter what age. It is a movie kids will show their children when they are older. Teenagers lined up to see Toy Story 3 years later because it meant so much to them back when they were little. Toy Story and its characters left a rare imprint on the hearts of people all over the world. Without a doubt, Toy Story gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and goes down as one of my personal all time favorite animation movies. Review; Disney and Pixar team up to create Disney's first full-length computer animated cinematic masterpiece, Toy story. Made in 1995, Toy Story was a marking point in movie history not only for its computer animation, but also having a timeless story full of witty characters and adventures. Toy Story is set in a suburban like neighborhood following an ensemble group of toys. Toys have human like abilities and personalities, but are forced to hide them from their human companions for the sake of being a toy. The main group of toys include a cowboy action figure, a piggy bank, a plastic dinosaur, a Mr. Potato Head as well as many more, all of whom live under their owner, Andy. The movie opens with Andy's birthday, which means receiving new toys to accompany old ones. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, is Andy's favorite action figure and also the group's leader. Woody and his fellow toy friends are somewhat threatened but also enthralled by this event. After a short time of announcing what Andy received, the toys are relieved to find that Andy did not receive any new toys. They were in for a surprise. Little did they know that there was a surprise toy on Andy's bed. It was the newest and coolest toy on the market, Buzz Light-year, a space orientated action figure voiced by Tim Allen who turns out to be Andy's next favorite toy. The strange thing about Buzz is that he believes that he is an actual space alien fighter. The toys try to convince Buzz that he is a mere toy only to be favored by Andy. Since Buzz believes he is actually a space fighter this leads into leaving the house and begin his journey to outer space. This ultimately pursues Woody to go and save his rival while getting tied up in a wacky adventure. There is a reason why this film acquired nineteen awards and ten nominations. Both adults and children will be entertained with the concept of living toys. The plot of the movie is really where it shines. There isn't one point in Toy Story where the plot gets boring or dragged out. People at Disney's Pixar developed the characters so well that it makes you understand how characters behave. Also, with a movie with so many diverse characters the audience is bound to find someone relate to. The only downside about seeing this movie is its length. It is around eighty minutes but it seems like the movie is about two hours, but that doesn't mean it isn't a full price movie because it is absolutely worth your time. Toy Story is definitely recommended to all families and especially kids. As for everyone else as an audience, I would recommend the movie if you would like to revisit your child hood or if you just want to see a beautifully animated movie. Whoever the audience may be, Toy Story will put a smile on your face. Toy Story is a classic beyond all means. It has stunning visuals, a crazy plot, deep character development, and most importantly it brings people back to a time when nothing mattered except toys. The most inspiring aspect of the movie is the moral of friendship. It really teaches people that they can't get anywhere in life without companionship. Toy Story also really captured the thought of \"what if toys were alive\" and executed it in a witty way. This movie will definitely be playing on family TV screens till \"Infinity and Beyond\"! Great fun for everyone; I just watched this movie for the first time since I was 12 (I'm 24 now). A lot of times when I view films I liked as a child, my perspective as an adult changes, by either noticing how little effort was put into certain films, or just that storyline/quality isn't there. Toy Story does not do this. As the first fully CG film, the detail I must say is fantastic and quite smooth. There is subtle adult humor in there that no child will be able to pick up, which makes this a great family flick, since both adults and children can enjoy it. The plot is original and quite interesting. And too anybody who ever lost a \"Toy\" as a child, sometimes you may wonder, if they got up on their own and walked away. It's sad that now and days, family films/kids films don't focus as much on story and dilogue like they used too and things just become a jumbled mess or completely juvenile. This film has quality story, dilogue and voice acting. And unlike a lot of other Disney movies which portray violence and some direct indendendo, this takes a lighter comedic side and it's a refreshing change from some films prior to it and even things made till this day. With that it also displays human emotions (Exaggerated of course for what they toys are feeling) But none the less, displays the essence of feeling replaced, or trying to be something you want to be,without having the means to do so. I highly reccemmend this to anybody who hasn't seen it yet. If you're and adult, don't be turned off by the CG animation. It's not by any means like a cartoon. The best film for small children....; My toddler has been watching this film for about 3 months, and I'm not sick of it and neither is she. It doesn't scare her, and it's teaching her about imagination, friendship, and kindness. All the performances are top notch, and the script is phenomenal. Any movie that has \"Wind the Frog!\" as a line , has to be a classic. The virtual world that has been created is remarkable in itself, but is equally partnered with a wonderful script. The song's compliment and impart in-depth character and plot points and Woody's personal journey is a lesson for all. I never really thought this was the best movie...; Toy Story is a good movie. It has good characters and a decent story. But is it really worth the hype? Yes, it's the first fully computer animated movie ever made and that's very impressive. For that reason alone, it will stand out in history. But I certainly never really thought it was the brilliant classic everyone else thought it was. Its animation is great but the story suffers from major pacing issues. There are entire moments of the movie right in the middle that bore me every time and don't stop boring me until I get to the film's climax, when it picks up again. A lot of trimming should have been done in the middle. Toy Story is good but its sequels are a lot better. So is it bad? No. But it's not brilliant. If this were 2-D, I doubt it would receive this high praise. Best Pixar movie to date!; Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (\"I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout\"). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox. this movie is awesome!the humor never bores!; i remember when this movie came out in 1995. i was seven at the time. i have loved it since day 1. actors such as tom hanks and tim allen bring sparkle to the show. they are both hillarious as woody and buzz. this movie is directed at both kids and adults. the humor never goes flat and it is never cheesy or corny. if you are a fan of tom hanks and tim allen or you just want a good laugh, than you shoud definitely watch this movie. you will not regret it. ********** out of **********. Loved It 10 Stars! Great Disney Movie!; Im 14 Years Old And I Saw Toy Story When I Was 10 Years Old I Loved It And I Still Do Today! Toy Story Is About Buzz And Woody And The Rest Of The Toy Gang Trying To Save Buzz From The Evil Sid! Very Good Movie! With The Voices Of Tim Allan (Home Inprovment) Tom Hanks (Forest Gump) And Don Rickles (Classc Tv Star) And Jim Varney (Ernest) -Jeremy One of the very best animation movies; TOY STORY stands on totally own feet! Having the sequel released after this, the TOY STORY became quickly a high status animation movie. In this first movie we get to know Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Potato Head and all the others, and I tell you; it's so jolly good entertainment! Seeing things from a toys perspective, is really fascinating and really cool, having stairs as a huge mountain and a aggressive dog is the Devil itself! TOY STORY starts off very wity, and although the movie gets darker and more exciting, it always has this extremely charming and wity undertone. I laughed jolly loud, and it is such a pro made movie that it's already a classic. STARS; 5/5 I seen a movie quite like this one; I saw this movie was I was about 10 years old and I was captivated. This film was awesome. I watch it over and over again with my younger siblings and I enjoy it just as much as them. It's a great story and every time I watch it, it brings out the the kid in me. Tom Hanks was amazing as Woody. Tom Hanks is one of my heroes and he never seizes to amaze me. He really brings Woody to life and he fits the role perfectly. Toy Story has a really good, solid story line and amazing visuals, especially for 1995. Toy Story 2 was almost as amazing as this movie, but nothing's as good as the original. I heard that they're making a Toy Story 3 set to be released in 2008. I'm hoping the theater is packed, with different generations, appreciating how Toy Story is not a only a stunning film, but also an example of the best kind of art there is. An absolutely awesome motion picture. 100/10 Exciting; Toy story is a 1995 American computer-animated adventure buddy comedy film produced by Pixar Animetion Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures, directed by John Lasseter at his directorial debut. Toy story was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first theatrical film produced by Pixar. In the film, toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present. A group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy, are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother and his sister are preparing to move the following week. The toy's leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Woody organized the other toys. Andy gets an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear as a birthday present. He believes that he is an actual space ranger. What happen to Andy's toys next? The characters have individuality. The picture on the screen is colorful, so I think the film is very cute. I am excited because I think about what happen next and what Andy's toy do next. I love the film's view of the world. Everyone enjoys the film, regardless of age or sex. I want you to watch the film. Pixar's first full length movie.; This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back 10 years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies. Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only 7 when I first watched it in theaters). The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like \"Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc.\" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him. Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a \"Buzz Lightyear\" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys. Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more. I give it an 8/10 perfect movie for the whole family to watch. Four Dimensional Toybox; I see that my previous comment on this film was deleted. This is the thing that started it all: Pixar. Somewhat photorealistic modeling. Deep, deep attention to story dynamics. An animated feature not so polished since \"Snow White.\" Something worthy. Something that led to the reinvention of Disney. Its an iconic turning point, like \"Citizen Kane,\" \"2001,\" \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" Greenaway's \"Tempest.\" (and others) Many things after change. So it should be seen on its historical basis alone. Here already you can see that Pixar decides to combine goals. They want the movie to be just as good as the best non- animated movie. There is the well-documented attention to refining and refining the story dynamics so that the narrative spine simply works. That took years. What I mean by combined goals is that they also realized that they were presenting something relatively new in their three D modeling capability. So they wanted to have that new cinematic vocabulary enhance the narrative dynamics and vice versa. It is subtle here, not fully developed until \"Nemo.\" But its plain to see when pointed out: the camera simply moves in ways that a real one does not. There are a broader set of intimate and distanced observer perspectives. These are not overused, lest you notice them, but you can see that out tolerance and viewing skill has slowly evolved from this to the later Pixar projects. (At this writing, that is \"Wall-E.\") The business about family and desired roles are not \"the point\" as some would say, but strategies to explore this deeper narrative power. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching. Great Animation, Great Characters; This movie probably was the best kids' movie I've ever seen in my life. Its animation was superb and Tim Allen was very funny as the voice of Buzz Lightyear, an action figure who really thinks he is the space hero he's supposed to be. The rest of the characters also had great things to say. \"That's not flying, that's falling with style!\" was an unforgettable line. It was a great movie.; This was, and still is, a great movie. It was amazing how the toys sort of live a double life, behaving like humans when no one's looking. I loved how all the toys are like a big family, with Woody being like a leader. As for Buzz Lightyear, I thought he was going to be really tall, but it turns out, he's shorter than he appeared. It was hilarious how Buzz believed he was a \"space ranger\". Also, Woody and Buzz sort of reminded me of Tawni and Sonny from the show Sonny With a Chance when they first met. Both Buzz and Sonny were \"the new kid\" who got accepted by almost everyone, and both Woody and Tawni were the only one who didn't accept the \"new kid\" and got jealous (but eventually learned to accept the \"new kid\"). So now, when I watch this movie, I think of the first episode of Sonny With a Chance. Best of the pixar movies; I am a big fan of all of Pixars movies and have seen all of them at the cinema, however for me this stands head and shoulders above the rest (including this years brilliant WallE). I watched it again recently and despite my age was pissing myself with laughter. This is mainly down to the characters who are so fresh. The banter between woody and Buzz is terrific (\"YOU ARE A TOY!!!\") and the other characters are also brilliant, especially ,for me, the bitter, angry and cynical Mr potato head , who lends a slightly darker more adult edge to this film compared to the Pixar movies to come ,as well as Sid his dog and the mutilated toys he has created. It is after all the only pixar movie rated parental guidance, i think which lets the emotions of the characters be more human in the shape of jealousy, pride and competitiveness. The central ideas of toys being alive when you cant see them is probably their best idea to date just in sheer amount of imagination and the amount of opportunity and possibility it creates (their is after all a sequel) and does kind of become a template for later. This definitely provided a lifeline for Disney who had seriously passed its golden age, and were starting to lose their reputation of quality and connection with its younger and older audience. With Lasseter moving to head of creative output at Disney, hopefully he will put them back on track also. (By the way I noticed a lack of any fathers in it, I don't know if thats meant to be read into) Fantastically Enjoyable Classic; Toy Story is about an old cowboy doll's jealousy toward a new spaceman toy, and the trouble it gets them into. The movie is a joy to watch, with a witty script jam-packed with hilarious gags and funny lines, wrapped up in an engaging, adventure-type plot. It's filled with appealing characters, voiced by an extraordinary cast. Tom Hanks as the cowboy and Tim Allen as the spaceman fit their roles perfectly, backed up by the amusing support of R. Lee Ermy, Jim Varney, and John Ratzenberger. The story does rely too much on coincidences (getting picked up by the next-door neighbor) and stereotypes (surfer-talking, reckless teenage pizza delivery guy), though. Contains: A Mild Comic Fight, Some Scary Images Toys come to life in this entertaining computer-animated film from Pixar...; It's only now, fifteen years after its release, that I decided to give TOY STORY a look on my large flat screen TV. I've never been a fan of computer animation per se, but this charming story has heart and wit and enough entertainment value for both young and old. The toy characters are both appealing and very funny in ways that anyone can appreciate, thanks to a clever script. Woody the Cowboy and Buzz Lightyear compete for the affections of a small boy, Andy, whose playroom is loaded with toys that come alive whenever anyone leaves the bedroom. Out of this fresh idea, the plot bounces along with supreme confidence as it races forward putting all of them in constant danger from their ever changing environment, especially when they leave the confines of Andy's home. Technically, the film is a marvel--everything simulated through computer wizardry, all of it invented with taste for artistry evident in every frame of the film--the kind of artistry that the Walt Disney studio demonstrated during the heyday of their cartoon wizardry. The brilliant colors look even more amazing in the good print of the film that aired on cable tonight. Well worth watching for pure family entertainment, a rarity nowadays. Pixar First Feature is an Instant Classic; Pixar's long line of success began in 1993 with TOY STORY, the first in a series of highly successful CG family films. Pixar had the formula nailed from the start, creating a fun kid's film with a powerful story capable of entertaining adults. In the film, we're introduced to the world of Andy's room when no one's around and the toys come to life. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is a classic cowboy doll complete with a pull-string vocal box and reigns as young Andy's favorite toy. For his birthday, Andy receives a flashy new Buzz Lightyear action figure (voiced by Tim Allen) and Woody must cope with the fact that he may have been bumped from the top position. A botched attempt at lodging Buzz behind Andy's desk throws Buzz out into the real world and Woody must bring him back to regain the trust of the other toys. The fun of this kid's film lies in the characters. Allen is hilarious as Buzz and his inability to grasp that he's merely a child's toy and not an actual space ranger, spending half the film trying to return to Star Command; Hanks is a bit neurotic and totally high strung as Woody in his role as the toy-in-charge (going so far as to hold meetings on plastic erosion and establishing a buddy-system for moving day). The room is loaded with great supporting characters in the form of classic playthings from everyone's childhoods: a Slinky dog, a Mr. Potato Head, a piggy bank",
       "each with their own unique personalities. These characters are each fun enough to deserve their own movie and we're lucky to have been given the TOY STORY sequels to return to this world. I really enjoy the film overall (as do just about everyone I know who's seen it) and there is little to complain about. It's amazing to see how well the animation stands up after so many years. You can see that the computer graphics aren't as smooth as modern CG, but it's still near seamless. Pixar's first film is a classic I was happy to introduce to my daughter. Cynical and disturbing; This is one film that left me with a very sour aftertaste.  Yes, it's animated with character and vigour, and there are some fine -- if over the top -- voice performances.  However, there are some very disturbing aspects to the film.  The first is that it's like nothing so much as watching a 90 minute advert.  Even if merchandising hadn't been released to support the film, all the supporting cast could already by bought in your local toy shop.  I'm sure I wasn't the only viewer who found this more than a little suspect. Possible spoiler: The second, perhaps larger, point against the film lies in the characterisation of the two boys, Andy and Sid.  Andy is the \"good\" boy. He plays safely and passively with his toys, they don't do anything toys wouldn't do.  Sid, the \"bad\" boy is more creative.  He adapts toys to fit his own vision, he's an innovator, a creator.  It's this very creativity of his that is portrayed as a bad thing.  Sid isn't the ideal target audience for this film: he wouldn't be satisfied with row after row of identical shop-bought toys, he would much rather make his own.  I guess this review is being written for all the Sids out there, who are demonised and vilified by this ultra-corporate nightmare of a film. Wonderful Film One of Pixar's Best; I love animated Disney films, although I must say I usually prefer the original classic hand drawn Disney films, at some point we have to accept change, and what better way to accept this change with a wonderful superb film. (I mean common they booked Toy Story 4 already). Toy's come to life when their owner is asleep, and its all about the battle for who is the best and most popular toy. Whenever Christmas or the little boy's birthday come around the toys get nervous that they will be abandoned or replaced. When a new toy arrives they are determined to hate him and ignore him, but they end up becoming friends. It was a privilege witnessing this film-making achievement.; Pixar started with a big bang: Toy Story. I loved this film as a kid and all the more as an adult. Every moment in this film is memorable, great or small. Don't tell me you don't remember parts like Andy's playtime with Mr. Potatohead as the villain, that mosquito on Buzz's visor, Pizza Planet, or at least one of the twisted toys. The way the story is put together is simple yet clever. The characters are lovable and are all equally important to the story. I may not have realized back then that I was seeing the first cgi animated feature film but I am somewhat glad I didn't know about that. Having to enjoy the film sincerely is way better than that. It's still a privilege seeing this on it's original date. The Largest Part Of My Childhood Put On Screen.; With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. \"Toy Story\" was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises &amp; confidence. How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history. I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling &amp; technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals &amp; entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks &amp; Tim Allen, and almost immediately think \"Toy Story\". As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then. Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, \"Toy Story\" is that proof. 10/10. Great Fun For Kids And Adults Alike; Toy Story is one of those rare animated movies, designed for children, that adults can enjoy. Plot In A Paragraph: Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) is 8 year old Andy's favourite toy, however his world falls apart when Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) figure for his birthday and he has to play second fiddle to the new space ranger. I loved this movie. Over the years I have watched it with both my kids and nieces and nephews and they have all enjoyed it. Watching it now, it has lost none of its charm. Tom Hanks is superb as Woody, Tim Allen (who I'm not a fan of) is delightful as the deluded Buzz Lightyear who is not aware he is an action figure, but for me the stand out voice was John Ratzenberger as Pork Chop the Piggy Bank. simply a timeless classic; this movie is one of the best, if not the best animated movie i have ever seen. i have seen this feel so many times, and yet every time i see it is has the same magic as when i first saw it. i would strongly recommend this film to anyone that has a shred of taste. suitable for adults and children alike. there is nothing this film doesn't have. hilarious and sweet. the voice actors finish this movie off, and it will stay on your mind for a very long time. i have seen all of the pixar movies i can think of, and by far this stands out as the best. how anyone doesn't like this movie i don't know. such a simple story, that we all dreamt up when we were young, is captured in an incredible fashion. this movie simply would not work as well if it was normal cartoon. followed up by an equally good movie, it is easy to say that you will never see another movie that captures your childhood as well as this does the plot is simple, and never feels to simple or complicated. there is never a second where there is confusion, or there is not something that the audience will like. attention is captured and maintained. Technically impressive with great script and sharp wit; Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence. Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula. The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads. Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors.  Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz.  Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults. Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things! 4th best film of all time!; This is the first movie I ever saw. I grew up with this film and loved ever since I was little. A few movies surpass it, but every other film iv'e ever seen is inferior. This is one of the big ones. It takes a lot to live up to this film. Its one of the most popular films, if not the most popular film of all time! Tom Hanks and Tim Allen head the lead voice cast. A cowboy doll named Woody, whose been the favorite of his owner, Andy since he first got him, is in for it when he's replaced by the latest and hottest new toy, Buzz Lightyear, (Tim Allen). A few accidents here and there get them stranded in the middle of nowhere, causing them to team up to get back home. If the story isn't enough to pull you in, (which it should be anyway) then the beautiful animation, the brilliant voices, and the funny jokes will be more than enough. Of course, iv'e seen the movie so many times, I know about each scene and each fact of the movie by heart. Even after all these times watching it, I still manage to laugh at it a little. Everybody whose anybody has seen, or at least heard of this film. I don't know a single person who hasn't seen this. All I can say left is that its one of the greatest and touching films of all time. Except for a few other films, nothing passes this film! An Instant Classic!; After a few short films and no major recognition-in 1991, Pixar set out to start the ball rolling for computer-animated entertainment and in 1995 unleashed not just a mere film but a work of art. An instant classic when first released...Toy Story went on to earn nearly $400 million worldwide and capture the hearts of children and adults alike with its unforgettable characters, magical musical score, hilarious script and the classic quote \"To infinity and beyond\". Woody (Tom Hanks) is an old-fashioned pull - string cowboy doll living a life of luxury as the favourite toy of a young boy named Andy. Surrounded by a colourful cast of characters - such as the cynical Mr. Potato Head, the wisecracking Piggy bank Hamm and Woody's brown-nosing second-in-command Slinky Dog - Woody seems something of a king. However, when a new toy arrives on the scene-a high tech spaceman action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Woody suddenly loses his popularity. But this toy comes with a surreal extra feature - he thinks he's the real Buzz Lightyear!! In the effort of removing Buzz as Andy's favourite toy-both toys are swept out of their home, and into the outside world where they unite reluctantly in friendship for an adventure home. The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in 1937 lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Pixar begins; I recently went to see the double feature which included \"Toy Story\" and \"Toy Story 2\" and I don't know if it's the nostalgia kicking in but it was still quite fun. I mean it wasn't good as when I first saw it when it came out when I was in elementary school, but it was still pretty entertaining and brought back some memories. The animation was amazing, and phenomenal when it first came out and still holds up today. The voice actors even did a great job, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did a great job with there performance in portraying Woody and Buzz Lightyear. It was a exciting adventure, although the plot was simple it was effective and entertaining.The story is about toys coming to life, but keeping themselves secret by acting like they aren't alive. But the toys coexist with humans peacefully, except the toys in Andy's room get worried on birthdays and Christmases of being replaced. Thus when Andy's favorite toy get replaced by a new favorite toy, the conflict starts from there when the older toy that was Andy's favorite tries to hide the new toy, but ends up hitting it out the window. Although this day and age, kid's who are about Andy' age probably won't play with the types of toys portrayed in the movie, and the magic was sort of lost from when I saw it when I was in elementary. This movie is still ahead of it's time, by a large margin. 8.5/10 An amazing family film; Toy Story is a timeless classic. Probably the most genuine, innocent, simplistic yet powerful attempt to create a children film which appeals both adults and kids alike. It is the story of how two rival 'living' toys - a old western cowboy toy (Woody) and action figure of a space commander (Buzz Lightyear) become best friends under some dangerous circumstances. There are bunch of numerals toys like Mr. Potato, a Barbie, a magnifying toy, a truck, alien toys and many more. The film is crafted so well that within some few minutes of the film, you are intrigued to it. It is a fascinating film, with amazing characterization. The toys are so believable that you feel close to them. You feel cherished when Allan and his company make a spoiled brat kid Sid (who loves blowing up toys) realize how important is to save toys which bring back the memories of childhood. I must say the script is effortless and very well written. Music by Randy Newman is also great. One striking thing in this film are its sound effects and CGI which are considered ground-breaking for a 1995 film. Overall, the film is highly recommended. Not only for children, but for everyone who love cherishing the childhood memories - the lovely Toys. fantastic; Toy Story i think is a fantastic animated movie to watch. This movie was rated as a PG (Parental Guildence) This movie was made in 1995. This is fantastic to watch, i got to tell ya. It is an amazing animated movie. I give this movie 10 out of 10. As Good as It Gets!; What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It's a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can't really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the \"humanity\" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute. The movie that changed all animations that were to come; Even though there were other animation classics such as Lion King, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, no other animation movie, prior to this, had being a 3D Computer Animated Film making this one of the most ground-breaking films of all time. This movie is also unique in every sense. Even though the movie is targeted for children and is the movie that every single child watches during their child hood, its so good that even adults absolutely love it. The film follows the tale of Andy's toys who are, unknown to all humans, actually alive. During the movie, as Buzz, Andy's new toy comes, Sheriff Woody becomes jealous of Buzz as he becomes Andy's new favorite and attempts to put an end to it but Buzz gets his revenge. However, the two get captured by Sid, the evil kid next door that enjoys torturing toys and must try their best to escape. To be fair, this movie is one of the shortest films I've ever seen but also one of the most enjoyable. The voice acting for the film is just masterful. Tom Hanks voice acting of Woody is just brilliant and Tim Allen as Buzz was brilliant. The voice acting just added further strength to every aspect of the film. The animations for a 1995 film, being the first 3D animated film, is just visually amazing! Though it may not stand out against recent visual animations, this movie is just a joy to watch, even after 18 years! One thing that is incredibly cool is that they don't explain how exactly the toys ever were alive and its great to see such thing left anonymous. I also found the characters extremely entertaining and the way that Buzz and Woody become friends during the film is just well made! Also, having your main characters toys and in fact making a movie entirely based on toys can be some pain and something which people just laugh at but in this film, we as an audience are emotionally connected to these plastic toys! Its because, despite being toys, the director portrays these as human like things which makes it extremely interesting to us. The dialogue in the film is great and as a result it constantly made me laugh. I loved that little kid as a villain. I thought he was fascinating and I'm glad that very little time is spent about Andy. Despite being made for children all adults are sure to have a blast with this film. In fact, I don't see why nobody has yet to see this film. In case you haven't, be sure to remember that this film changed all animation films to come and that this is surely one of Pixar's ever most finest films! Simply, the best animated film of them all.; Disney used to be good, wholesome family entertainment that was not only clean but fun. Now, most everything they put out is outdated postmodern trash that portrays all children as geniuses able to rule the world and all parents as evil minions trying to keep their children from having fun. Thank God for Pixar coming to existence. Starting with Toy Story in 1995, they made a great family film that appeals to adult humor as well as children. They haven't failed since. They can do no wrong it seems, and I pray it continues that way. Of all their great films, this is undoubtedly in my mind the best of them all. It is also arguably better than any animated film Disney ever did, including the classics of the 1940s and 50s. The premise is so clever and daring in that it could go wrong in so many ways. It never does, though, and in a mere 82 minutes, it covers more information than many other 2 hour films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have become iconic in their roles as Woody and Buzz. The animation and dialogue is so good it is as if they are really on screen arguing with one another. The supporting characters are also very good and funny. With animation, perhaps the most important aspect is the voice characters. Pixar has done a great job of not always going with a star to do the voices, but rather simply going with the one that fits the character best. Overall, Toy Story is superb film-making with a great script, wonderful voices and animation that still impresses despite all the technological improvements. Thank you, Pixar. I am truly grateful to you for saving animated films. one of the best movies of 1995; toy story is another successful Disney 90s flick of the 90s followed by A goofy movie The lion king and inspector gadget 1 and the other 90s Disney movies this one is so outstanding its about toys that come to life when their owner is not looking and are feared about getting replaced if you can remember Johnson and friends the kids TV series where toys come to life and feared that they are going to be replace but that has nothing to do with this very successful movie I love this movie to bits its good fun and great for kids and adults too if you have toys in your room you night think they are alive trust me you can think of it so if you love Disney movies like A goofy movie Herbie the love bug The lion king or other very successful Disney movies from the 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s or the early 2000s then you will love this one its great to have for your Disney DVD or VHS sets. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 because people really love it. Brilliant, Simply Brilliant Film; Sometimes, just Sometimes, A Disney film is released and is made into a classic. Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, Bambi are just a few of the classics. But My all time fave Disney films are the ones made by Pixar. Toy Story, is my third favourite Disney Film. The story revolves around a toy cowboy called Woody (Tom Hanks, who does an excellent job)who is owned by Andy, a 4 year old boy. On Andy's birthday, he recieves a Buzz Lightyear action figure (Tim Allen, who does an unforgettable job as Buzz). Buzz slowly becomes Andy's favourite, leaving Woody Jealous, he schemes to purposely lose Buzz, but his plan backfires, leaving him and Buzz away from home. I won't reveal much else, but the Idea is so clever, well.. It's hard not to. This is an excellent film, 10/10 Rubbish movie, so many plot holes...; I don't understand why this film is so highly rated. The film has so many plot holes in it I actually lost count. Now before I start this review, I'm not going to say toys talking is a plot hole, the idea of them talking is interesting but it opens up so many other questions that the movie never really explains. Also, don't argue, \"it's a kids movie\", films need to make sense in order to work whether they're for kids or not. This film is so bad and here is why. Even if you like this film, you have to agree with some of the points I'm making here: Buzz thinks he's a space ranger. If that is the case then why does he allow Andy to play with him? Does he not think why is this giant kid picking me up and throwing me around? Buzz however makes no attempt to communicate with Andy. Surely Buzz would try and talk to him? This doesn't make sense given that Buzz doesn't believe he's a toy. Also when Woody hits a button that release Buzz's helmet and he gasps for air, you're telling me Andy never pushed that button? He's owned the toy for weeks yet hadn't pressed all the buttons? Rubbish. The end scene is one of the worst scenes for me. It's broad daylight and two toys are running down a street. Where are all the pedestrians on the street? How are they able to open the back of the moving van truck? Surely the driver would notice doesn't he check his rear view mirrors, or surely a button or signal would come up revealing that a door was open at the back of his truck? Wow any thief could steal from this useless driver. Also when Woody and Buzz fly down from the sky and land in Andy's car. Andy's car is directly in front of the truck driver, how could he possibly not see this??? The most hilarious scene though is when Woody is moving around in the middle of the road and a person in a car honks at him. Woody then ducks in front of the car as it drives over him. 1) Why would you sound your car horn if there was a toy in the road? 2) The driver therefore saw Woody as he sounded his horn. 3) He must have seen Woody moving about and be thrown from the moving van. Does this driver know toys are alive or something? Is it only kids who are unaware? I just don't understand. It's never fully explained. Continuing this point: when the toys all surround Woody and prepare to attack him after he knocks Buzz out the window, we hear Andy from outside shouting. This allows them to return into position. What if he hadn't have shouted though? He would have walked in and seen them. This is why this idea of toys coming to life could never work! No kid would always shout when they enter their room and most kids leave their doors open yet Andy never does - allowing the toys to move around and communicate. Once you take these plot holes into account, the conclusion is that the film sucks and is a really poor movie. Honestly how could anyone like it? An interesting idea that just falls flat. And also the final question that is never addressed is: Why can't toys reveal they're alive to humans??? It's never explained and I don't get why. Poor film 1 star. Awful. Classic Tale Full of Imagination; Toy Story (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) A kid's toy room is split after his former favorite toy Woody (Tom Hanks) gets replaced with the newest sensation Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). The gunslinger Woody can't except the fact that he's no longer the kid's favorite so he and Buzz end up outside of the house and must try and find a way back. The Pixar form of animation has become the standard today so I'm sure many people watching these films forget how groundbreaking this movie was when it was first released. I was only fifteen at the time but giving it a second viewing after all these years just reminds me at why this thing became a hit. Not only is the animation beautiful and extremely life like but we also got a terrific screenplay that certainly brings these characters to life and really makes them something special. The idea of a film being centered on toys that come to life when no one is looking is something so simple yet so genius that you can't help but wonder why it took someone so long to do a film. The screenplay is without question one of the best ever written for an animation movie as all of the characters, from Woody and Buzz to Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) are perfectly brought to life. The child-like nature of the story has so much energy that you can't help but smile at each journey that the toys find themselves on. The amount of imagination in the screenplay is what makes it so special because it really does seem like something a kid would come up with while playing alone in his room with the toys. Everyone can remember what it was like being a kid and playing with these toys and bringing them to life in our minds so to see that played out on the screen is certainly something special. The film has terrific laughs but also a nice message. The voice work is terrific with Hanks and Allen clearly leading the way but that Southern draw of Varney is special as well. TOY STORY was ground breaking when originally released and it comes as no shock that the film hasn't lost any of its impact. The screenplay with its great characters and story is guaranteed to be enjoyed for decades to come. Not just for children!; This is an awesome movie, and it's not just for kids! When I read this in the memorable quotes: Mr. Potato Head: How come you don't have a laser, Woody? Woody: It's not a laser! It's a little light that blinks! Hamm: What's wrong with him? Mr. Potato Head: Laser envy. I knew that this movie wasn't completely aimed at small children. But there were a few things that bothered me. How Andy plays with his toys so nicely, and Sid just takes apart toys and puts them together with other different parts. Isn't that a sign of creativity? Otherwise, this movie was great! Overall this movie gets a 9/10!!!</td>\n",

       " And then, first comes teen Dunst and i'm really surprised how good she acted (as she never convinced me as Peter's girlfriend). Next, Robin gets in the movie getting out the game and the magic operates : i really like the way past, present and future merge, how the game expands to the big mansion into town. If the special effects looks very tired, the story is original, full of surprises and proves that a humble cast can do as fine as a multiple billion dollars one ! Robin proved one more time he was a never grown-up kid with a beautiful soul with kids and the key to childish fun ! So i had a great time with this small movie as it gives me all i ask to cinema : to find a way to leave (cautiously) my world behind !! Probably worth checking out, even today; There is a lot to like in this movie. The concept was intriguing. Robin Williams plays a basic Robin Williams character, i.e. a man-child. I never would have recognized Kirsten Dunst or Laura Bell Bradley as children without the cast list, but they both performed well. David Alan Grier did befuddlement just as well back then as he does now. Bebe Neuwirth and Bonnie Hunt did nicely, and looked very nice as well. The pace got a bit frenetic for me, though I understand that this was deliberate. The CGI animals looked fine in the distance but up close, not so much. I know we are spoiled by the unlimited effects in films today, but some of these, like the lion, looked terrible. I saw in the credits that they had Industrial Light &amp; Magic, so I doubt it could have been done any better at the time. And some of the things in the ending did not seem to totally follow from the body of the film. It's probably worth checking out though, even today. Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Almost 20 years on and it's still entertaining kids of all ages; Jumanji was on TV today, and my 8 year old son had liked him in \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and I remembered it being fun, so with sweets and crisps we sat down to watch it. Orphans Judy (A young Kristen Dunst, who had started in \"An Interview With A Vampire\" the previous year, but still a few years away from Spiderman fame) and Peter move in to a mansion with their Aunt (Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers) where the find a board game called Jumanji. When they start playing, they free Alan Parish (Robin Williams) who was trapped in the game when he was a child. Robin Williams is always fun to watch and he was very popular at the time, due to movies like \"Aladdin\" and \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and Kristen Dunst was a real talent as a young actress, none of the annoying traits of usual child actors. Of the supporting cast David Alan Grier is fun as a hapless Police Officer, as is Jonathan Hyde in duel roles as a hunter and young Alan's Dad. Defo worth checking out if you have kids, and more than enjoyable even if you don't. Some of the special effects have dated badly, but are still OK, most of the humour is spot on too. My son got a big kick out if it and really enjoyed it. And I thought for a 19 year old special effects laden kids movie it had held up pretty well. review for jumanji.; This 1995 film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game 26 years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are 8+ as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than 8 and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark wild CGI destruction gets repetitive; In 1869, two boys bury a mysterious dangerous wooden chest. In 1969 Brantford, New Hampshire, young Alan Parrish gets picked on by bullies. He finds the box in a local construction site. He opens the chest to find a board game Jumanji. His father is sending him to boarding school. He is about to run away when his best friend Sarah Whittle comes by. They play the game and Alan is pulled into the board game. Twenty six years later, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) buys the rundown mansion planning to open a bed-and-breakfast. She brings her niece Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter (Bradley Pierce) who lost their parents in a car accident. The kids find the board game in the attic and start playing it. Alan (Robin Williams) is released. They track down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) to finish the game and bring all the released apparitions to an end. Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) was a friend who worked at Alan's shoe factory and is now a cop. The game brings out big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) who looks like Alan's father Sam. The basic idea of a board game that comes alive is one with great possibilities. I wish that it is more than just a series of crazy CGI destruction. I wish that the players needed to use their brain power to solve clues. The constant escaping from one thing to the next gets a little bit repetitive. They start piling on top of one another. Williams is not quite as lovable as expected. Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier are kind of fun. There is an uncontrolled quality to this children's movie. once it gets going it's pretty darn fun; i have t say,this movie started out pretty slow,and i thought it was gonna be a dud.i'm glad i kept watching.it turned into a pretty good movie.if you're into action and adventure,you'll certainly find it in abundance here.there are some great action sequences,providing scads of excitement.but there are also a lot of very funny moments,and there's even a hint or 2 of romance.there are some fantastic creatures here.the only downside i can think of is the visual effects.i found them kinda cheesy,and sometimes they didn't quite look real.the creatures sometimes looked a bit wonky,but other times were pretty realistic.but that's a small downside,since the movie is so much fun.Robin Williams is the featured performer here,but i thought Bonnie Hunt was terrific.Bebe Neuwirth was very good as well.but David Alan Grier was a riot.Kirsten Dunst was good too.overall, this is a good movie for both kids and adults.for me,Jumani is a 7/10 Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. Watchable Effects-laden family entertainer, though a bit predictable; This is a watchable family entertainer with some genuine scares. The plot appears complicated but is actually fairly simple. Hordes of wild animals appear and people flee. This happens again and again like clockwork throughout the film making it predictable after a while. On the plus side, Robin Williams is in manic form, and the Special Effects are agreeable though dated. Kirsten Dunst is very appealing in one of her earlier films. This is generally a pleasant watch, but on the whole, I prefer the newer film Zathura, which is also based on a board game. Overall 6/10 Still great to this day.; \"Jumanji\" is still fun to watch, it's an original story and has great performances, directing and dialogue. The film score composed by James Horner is fantastic. The special effects are damn good for it's day. There's no need for a sequel/reboot/remake or whatever the hell it is, it's cheapened this 90s classic. If they want to be respectful then leave this movie alone, stop trying to recreate something that won't work! Almost Thoroughly Enjoyable; If I had been 10 or 12 when this movie came out it would probably be my favorite.  As I was 34, my first reaction was that there was too much screaming. But there's much here for an imaginative youngster (or oldster) to enjoy.  The script is generally witty, and except for the screaming, parents will not be bored watching it -- and if they squint their minds eyes enough to remember what they enjoyed before puberty, they'll get a nostalgic rush. This is everything family entertainment should be.  And though it does involve the supernatural, it is presented in a negative light and none of the characters relish being part of it. Dated, but fun adventure for kids and adults alike; When Steven Spielberg launched 'Jurassic Park' in the summer of 1993, it broke major grounds in the visual effects department leaving everyone with their jaw dropping at the splendid computer-generated imagery of the dinosaurs. The success of the Spielberg brought birth to a new image of computer-generated effects as well special effects to the feast the eyes of viewers everywhere. This fantasy adventure based on the Award-winning children's book Jumanji by Chris Van Allsburg invites audiences for fun adventure in the jungle with computer-generated animals that hit a mark in the state-of-the-art territory at the time of its release, but unlike the superior Jurassic Park sadly look dated and unauthentic by comparison. That is certainly not to say however, that the fun of the magical fantasy excursion and the charm of the highly popular Robin Williams no longer remains. Set in 1995, the film follows a young boy named Peter Shepard (played by Bradley Pierce) and his sister Judy (played by Kirsten Dunst) who discover a mysterious game in the attic of the home 12-year old Alan Parrish (played by Adam-Hann Byrd) disappeared in twenty-six years ago. Upon rolling the dice, Peter and Judy unexpectedly release a thirty-something year old Alan (played by Robin Williams) who reveals to have disappeared into the game. Witnessing the magical powers of the game, Alan, Peter, and Judy team up along with Alan's old friend Sarah (played by Bonnie Hunt) to survive against the horde of jungle animals that threaten to destroy the town until someone finished the game. Lions, elephants, rhinos, monkeys, monsoons, carnivorous plants; all menacing obstacles our characters must overcome as the titular board game send their world in a mysterious jungle-like realm. It is a wild ride brought to life by the a smart execution by director Joe Johnston who knows the magic of Chris Van Allsburg's source material, and translation from book-to-screen by a screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh and Greg Taylor. But the question is \"has it aged well\". In terms of visual effects, the answer is sadly no as the computer generated imagery of the wild animals that release from the board game unfortunately fail to come to life as believable and striking as they did back in 1995. While the film's use of animatronics used on the some of the animals such as the lion have aged well in a way that can send shivers down your in the scene when the hairy creature threatens our young heroes, most of the effects look awfully dated and show evidence of a blockbuster flick released in the mid-1990s. Despite the lack of authenticity perpetrated by these subpar effects, the film luckily manages to stay fun and charming, especially by the comedic charm of Robin Williams who swarms in the movie with livelihood and humility as well as the rest of the cast including Bradley Pierce, Kirsten Dunst, and Bonnie Hunt. As the story progresses, viewers are in for a fair amount of dark, eerie elements including the death of the children's parents, Alan's broken relationship with his father, and the overall chaos that erupts from the game; all of which are enough to leave young children shivering. But with the fun-filled action uprooted in the adventure of the characters, there is still plenty for the family to enjoy. Jumanji may show its age in terms of the effects department, but is still a fun-filled adventure full of laughs, heart, and suspense to keep both kids and adults alike captivated from start to finish. Yes, it is disappointing that it fails to reach the roots of Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park; but that doesn't stop this fantasy adventure of being a friendly, fantasy spectacle. not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late 1960s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. Jumanji! From Book to Film; As a child in 1995, this was one of the greatest adventure films for a kid in my generation. The book from where it came, was good, but the filmmakers made the adaptation pretty darn amazing. The fact that Robin Williams starred made the film better, as Robin was a huge draw to family films of that era. Who ever knew that Jumanji would have a cult following or that it would spawn an actual board game (nothing comes to life), and eventually a sequel in 2017. Too bad Robin isn't here to enjoy or be a part of the sequel. Bonnie Hunt also starred alongside Robin in this film as Sarah, but she's not quite as memorable. Sorry! David Alan Grier also co-starred as Carl the police officer, his acting was somewhat more memorable. One of the most memorable acting performances of the film was Jonathan Hyde as Sam Parrish (Alan's dad) and his dual role as Van Pelt (the hunter from Jumanji). In the end, it was a great film, probably felt more now by some since the passing of Robin Williams. But those of us who've loved the film since the beginning know he made the film what it was. Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Pretty cute, zany adventure.; Let me start this by saying that Robin Was the main draw to this work, although the story is pretty innovative, only having been done a time or two previously. Zany. That's the principal description of this work, between Williams's near-manic performance and the fast-paced action, the busy screenplay, and the frantic sound effects. It was fun and entertaining, if nothing else. Features some monsters and over-sized creatures, so may not be suitable for all ages. It rates a 5.4/10 from... the Fiend :. Wish they had more Jumanji history; My only real complaint with Jumanji is where did this game come from? Who created it? I really wish they could have discovered more about the game's past, it's history. Then it would have made a little more sense. But I'm not saying I didn't like it. On the contrary, I do enjoy it very much, I think it's a cool buried treasure. The characters, the story, the effects all perfect. The cast does a great job in this movie and the concept of a strange magical board game works. I wish there was more monster animals. But the man eating plant and the giant spiders is enough to put it on my page. Robin Williams does great in this first monster movie, wish he do more. But that's just me. Anyway, in conclusion ladies and jelly spoons. This is an assume movie and you can do much worse then Jumanji. 8 STARS. Imaginative (spoiler); This is probably one of the most imaginative movies I have seen in a while. I mean, it has an entire back story, as we can see in the beginning, when those two kids are trying to get rid of the game. Then it goes to 1969, when Alan finds the game, he and Sarah start playing, and he gets sucked into Jumanji. Then, throughout the rest of the movie, Alan comes out of the jungle and he, Sarah, Judy, and Peter continue playing the game and unleashing all these dangerous animals (and Van Pelt) and the monsoon and killer plants into the city. And at the end, those kids in Japan find the game. Very well thought out. Certainly worth a look. An excellent family entertainment achievement, with the keyword family, not just kids.; The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children's book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die! Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter  I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families. Outrageous fun; When young Alan Parish and his childhood friend, Sarah play a board game that Alan found buried near his fathers business, Alan is sucked into the game and left to grow up alone in the jungle. That is until two young children, Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) join the game and release him 26 years later. Every turn in the game becomes a living nightmare that endangers the lives of everyone involved, and the only way to stop it is finish the game. Alan (Robin Williams) and Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) will have to play some more if there lives are return to normality. The concept of the movie is truly original and it successfully delivers on its potential, with an excellent cast and funny script, this adventure is both hilarious and action packed, with some cool special effects thrown in. Great family entertainment 8/10 Very enjoyable fantasy adventure.; Jumanji starts in 1969 in New Hampshire in New England where a young boy named Alan Parish (Adam Hann-Byrdd) &amp; his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) starts playing a strange board game called Jumaji that Alan found buried in the ground earlier, Jumanji turns out to be magical &amp; Alan is sucked into the board game while Sarah runs off. Twenty six years later &amp; it's 1995 &amp; Alan's old house has been empty for years until now, until young brother &amp; sister Judy (Kirsten Dunst) &amp; Peter (Bradley Pierce) move in with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), the two youngsters find the Jumanji game &amp; start playing it themselves as all manner of creatures &amp; climate events begin to appear as does Alan (Robin Williams) who has spent the last twenty six years trapped inside Jumanji &amp; is now an adult. The only way to reverse the effects of Jumanji is to finish the game so with a now adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) the four players must battle whatever Jumanji throw's at them including Lions, Monsoon's, giant Spider's &amp; a stampede... Girected by former special effects man Joe Johnston this oddball fantasy adventure is actually pretty good but there are one or two things that ultimately drag it down to merely a very good film rather than a great film in my opinion. Based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsberg the film is apparently quite different &amp; the two main character's here Alan &amp; Sarah don't even appear in the book, Jumanji is a hard film to categorise as it mixes various ideas &amp; themes like a bad childhood, finding redemption, standing up to your fears, fantasy, sci-fi, horror &amp; comedy. At 100 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace, once it gets going the situation just keeps getting worse &amp; worse as all the chaos &amp; mayhem escalates beyond anyone's control with all sorts of animals running around &amp; the theme of facing your fears is an ever present one. I am not sure there is another film quite like Jumanji &amp; to find something so original &amp; different in a mainstream film is unusual but the CGI effects scenes, the lack of character depth, the refusal to do anything with the plot other than destroy a house &amp; an ultra happy ending which goes on forever that gives every character in the film the best most happy ending is pure Hollywood that was not needed &amp; a slightly darker ending in keeping with the slightly darker tone of the film overall would have been much better. To be honest apart from great set-pieces &amp; the basic concept there's really not that much to Jumanji at all, it's rather shallow &amp; it's attempts at depth are pure heavy handed Hollywood cliché but it's fun &amp; very entertaining while it lasts, just a shame about the last ten minutes really. Jumanji was made just as the CGI computer graphic revolution was taking off back in the mid 90's but the effects do hold up rather well actually, from huge plants to an impressive stampede of Rhino's &amp; Elephant's through a house to a huge Lion with the mischievous Monkey's probably the only real weak effect. As a fairly light hearted fantasy adventure with some darker overtones there's a few amusing moments including a bemused policeman who's car is slowly &amp; systematically trashed &amp; as a whole the film delights in needless destruction &amp; mayhem which is no bad thing. There are some laughs &amp; a few scares as well &amp; I could definitely see Jumanji appealing to both older &amp; younger audiences. With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 this had a very healthy amount spent on it with most going towards the effects I would have thought. Filmed in New Hampshire &amp; British Columbia in Canada. Despite being known as a manic performer Robin Williams is pretty restrained here &amp; his brand of psychical comedy isn't used much, Kirsten Dunst is one of the few child stars to go on &amp; have a successful adult career while the acting generally is pretty good. Jumanji is a unique fantasy adventure that I think would appeal to both children &amp; adults, my only real problem is the sweeter than sweet happier than happy ending which is pure sentimental Hollywood at it's worst. With an ending more in keeping with the rest of the film Jumanji might have got a seven from but as it is it gets a six, good but not great. Followed by Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005) which was shot under the title Jumanji 2. An original plot poorly executed; I was really disappointed with Jumanji. I had heard about the concept and was looking forward to it. It is mean a mean spirited slap stick comedy with no redeeming social value. First of all, you have Robin Williams....I love Williams, when he is kept on a short leash by the director. Left to his own devices he tends to go off the deep end a bit. Then you add the lame script and an over-done score, you get a movie that misses. I gave this movie a 4 because it was an original concept, it had some great cinematography and it had a few really cool special effects. I would love to see this movie remade by a different director a better script writer. Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Unique; I am trying to find my words in order to perfectly describe Robin, but i just realized that it's impossible to do it. Words are not enough to describe such a man... I've seen a lot of people in my life, all kind of people, but i never saw someone having so much warmth and kindness in just a small smile like Robin. That's something which makes you to love him unconditionally. The way he acted in the movies was so original that it can not be compared with anyone else in the history of cinema. He's smile made us all better people a little bit, which means he changed the world in he's own way. He will be always with us, and within us. Let's make him immortal !!! The best of Allsburgh's film adaptations.; Author Chris Van Allburgh has had three film adaptations. His most recent was Zathura, which I didn't like. Before that, The Polar Express was released and re-released. I don't know why because I did't like it that much either. But ten years before Zathura was his first film adaptation, Jumanji. The only one I liked. The only one that critics disliked. Jumanji, for some reason, was a film that I really liked. I'll admit some of it was a bit weird, but I really liked it. I liked it because of Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, two great actors. People don't give Williams enough credit and the same with Hunt. But I love both of them. I also think the film has great visuals and it's a triumph with entertainment. I can understand why critics would call it weird, but I really liked it. You may disagree with me. But there's something about Jumanji that I really liked but I can't think of what exactly it is. Though some parts are kind of odd, Jumanji grabs my attention and I'm recommending it. The Plot: When two kids find a magical board game, they release tons of animals and a person who once played the game when he was younger. This game is like no other.; Roll doubles and look out.  Elaborate special effects highlight this tale about two kids who release an imprisoned player trapped for decades in a supernatural board game. Story line is quite stupid, but this is so much fun to watch. Robin Williams does his thing. A young Kirsten Dunst is charming in this preview of her future talents. Rounding out this mish-mash of a cast are: Bebe Neuwirth, David Alan Grier, Bradley Pierce, Bonnie Hunt and Jonathan Hyde in a dual role. Special effects and sight gags are redeeming. A dark, mysterious, and entertaining childhood favorite of mine; Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good. The end is near!; 'The end is near' was my best thought after an hour of Jumanji. The end of the movie that is. Despite a lot of good reviews of people I hardly know, this film is a first-class let-down. It is the somanieth movie in which Robin Williams comic qualities are abused. The story is about a game, Jumanji, that has come to life. After every move something terrible happens; a stampede or a giant spider attack. The game has to be finished to stop all terrible things happening. Of course Williams' comic talent and the special effects try to safe the movie but everything is overdone. By memory, I recall that the makers promised great special effects; they had used the same effects as Jurassic Park! Yes, they did, but they obviously only got the demo version of the package. Also, poor Kirsten Dunst, having the role of a nice young girl, is transformed is such a prig that all her good intentions fall into nothing. All in all, if you have to choose between watching this movie and cleaning up the house, please clean up your house starting with trashing the video of this movie. This is family entertainment; When two children play a board game a man trapped inside appears and tries to help them finish the game as jungle elements from the game trouble the environment. Shown every Christmas, re-released countless times and still Jumanji never loses its touch with its viewers. This breathtaking imagination of a board game coming to life is as wonderfully exuberant as toys coming to life in Pixar's first film. The concept of a game coming to life is made even more exciting by encoding prospects of deadly animals such as lions, mysterious mosquitoes and violent talented monkeys. Everything is thought of and what a treat we have in our hands. There is now a new definition of family entertainment, known as Pixar. Since releasing Toy Story after this was released they have been dominating the box office with wonderful family tales about sentimental robots, cooking rats and racing cars. And to rewind the clock back 14 years this picture is to be hailed as the beginning of the end. A truly new concept with very little explanation required and a marvellous array of hormonal characters with breathtaking action and enough humour to make you smile, this was and still is marvellous. Family entertainment now either involves a boy with a wand, Harry something, or sitting in your living room watching Simon Cowell make fun of ordinary folk. The reprisal if you want to call it that of non-animated picture was in 2005 where Jon Favreau attempted a step up from this picture, by using the same concept of a board game coming to life and applied it with a sci-fi edge, set in space. Whilst there were moments of good action it boiled down to being a repetitive ideology of this 1995 classic with not enough quick wit and mistimed action sequences with an egregious sentimental intention of brotherly love. This has none of that. There are no overly soppy sentimental parts as the required drama is justified early on. The action continues consistently with first initial deadly elements before the stakes are raised. Van Pelt adds a sharp intake of breath threw his evidently evil hunter, which actually is never properly explained, but that is the point. Nothing is explained, events just happen and we can sit back and enjoy the fun spilling out from every angle. Johnston is the man in the know as the adventure flows with exquisite timing. The scene with the house flood is a perfect example whilst the monkey motorbike stage shows his ability to do comedy. This truly is a remarkable film and is worth watching again and again for its wondrous story, its lovable collection of characters and easy sharp mind. This is family entertainment! good original family movie; Joe Johnston's Jumanji is very good family movie that is well paced. The movie is the story of a mysterious game that involves it's players more than the normal board game. The movie begins with a young boy, Alan Parrish, finding the abandoned game. He talks the girl he has a crush on, Sarah Whittle, into playing with him. Once the game starts, chaos ensues. Robin Williams carries this movie, giving it life. The other actors do okay with the bare dialogue. Joe Johnston uses the experiences on the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies to craft a fantasy world that is believable. Though not outstanding in any way, Jumanji is a fun movie that should delight children with its action and fantasy. 6 out of 10 stars. Very cute, feel good movie; I gave Jumanji 7 out 10, which is a pretty good rating from me. 10 are epics like Gone With The Wind &amp; Lawrence of Arabia, 9 are classics and 8 the near great. 7, like Jumanji, are just good, clean fun; not Oscar worthy movies, but movies worth watching. Robin Williams delivers a fairly straight performance for him, but it works, it is good acting. Kirsten Dunst, does a great job as his love interest and former playmate. Other roles by David Alan Grier, Bonnie Hunt, Jonathan Hyde and Bebe Neuwirth fill out the cast nicely along with the child actors who play Peter &amp; Judy and the young Alan &amp; Sarah. Jumangi was one of the better, more successful films to come out of TriStar. One of my favourite films ever; This film is great, it is definitely a family film (little kids might get scared when there are *SPOILER* guns shooting or when the giant spiders have surrounded the actors,or when a crocodile attacks the man but apart from that it isn't too scary), but it is one of those films everyone has got to see. I first watched this film when it first came onto TV (they now repeat it every year), and I have been captivated by the imaginative story every single time I've seen it. The basic storyline is that two kids find an old board game, but when they start playing, the madness begins- stampeding animals and more! This is a story about friendship, love, sticking together and much, much more. If you haven't seen this film already WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!! Below average action adventure; I knew Jumanji was never going to burst with intelligence or be driven by great performances, and yet despite this I was quite looking forward to it as a holiday blockbuster. Well to put it in simple terms that was a mistake. The films plot stands a chance of being the most convoluted of the year with so many back stories it only ever annoys. It starts of with a young boy called Alan Parish who gets sucked into a board game, at this point I should have left as it only gets more idiotic. After this incident we flash forward twenty years to find two new children have found the game. They unleash Alan who is now grown up and played by an irritating Robin Williams. Along with him an assortment of Jungle beasties are unleashed into their quiet neighbourhood. The kids and Alan must complete the game to restore everything but with every throw of the dice more horrors await. The film resembles an ameturish pantomine in every respect a part from the visual effects. Director Joe Johnston also responsible for the mediocre Honey I shrunk the Kids should have treated the audience like adults, then the film might have gone somewere. However as the movie doesn't treat us like adults and depends totally on its special effects I think its safe to say its a failure. The performances particularly from the children and Robin Williams are predictable and annoying. Jumanji might entertain under 7's or those with IQ's under 50 but for the rest of us it simply is a heavily flawed and rather rubbish piece of cinema Early CGI Makes the Monkeys Look Fake! Otherwise It's Amazing!; An enchanted board game breaks into the real world and the only way out of it is to finish the game! The monkeys look \"washed-out\" and so do some of the wild zoo animals; which is why most of the rest of the EFX are mechanical or use backdrops and mattes. Otherwise a very strong 10 would be my vote, as the casting works and the plot shows lots of imagination and flair. With a \"sly wink\" to \"Peter Pan\", Alan's father plays both his dad and Van Pelt the Hunter. My two favorite scenes are when the house gets folded in half and eaten by the monstrous plant, and when everything swirls backwards into the gameboard. I also love it when the house goes \"wild\" and turns into a swamp complete with nasty alligators. I do not like the scene where the little boy turns into a monkey with a tail. Young children may find it disturbing like the donkey transformation in \"Pinocchio\". \"Jumanji\" is suspenseful and scary but no one actually dies in the film. Therefore, it's much more enjoyable when viewed again. The only one who seemed to hate it was Roger Ebert, but it's only too scary for pre-schoolers. Most \"users\" love it! What \"scares\" me the most in this film: the bats, insects, spiders, alligators, and The Hunter. The sequel will not have the charisma of the late and great Robin Williams. I still miss him. He was a comic genius. If there was a market for it, I would like it to be re-imagined with better graphics like the old \"Star Trek TOS\" reissue.  So you'll help us?; Robin Williams is incredible as Alan in this outstanding adventure movie. The supporting cast is phenomenal. The costumes are conservative. One of the good films in the genre, Jumanji will dare the viewer to play the game. 7 out of 10. 18 years of being a \"favourite\"; I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and \"Jumanji\" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie &amp; it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life. Jumanji; I think that kids would like this movie better then grownups. I loved this movie but my mom thinks the plot is to low. The movie is based on the book Jumanji and is a lot more deeper then the book. My bother thought that the movie was corny and the special effects were so bad they were funny but what does he know? OK maybe the effects were bad but whatever. I mean the movie was made along time ago so give them a break. I thought the movie was really good and the acting was great. Its the kind of movie that if you like it you watch it again and again and again. When I was sick I saw it 4 times and I still thought it was good. All and all I would give this movie a 9. I think that kids would like to see it. The Disney movie that could have been; Hunt and Williams play the parts of shellshocked-delayed stress syndrome surviviors quite well. The story is entertaining and engrossing, with both elements of light and darkness. The effects-well, they DO look a bit unreal-and perhaps that is for the best-it adds a sense of unreality to the story -after all, these things come from a board-game universe! Even Van Pelt looks a bit CGI...and Bebe Nuewerth is a sweetie. Decent family entertainment; On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children. Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it. In the jungle you must wait....; In the jungle you must wait, until the dice reads five or eight. So professes a mysterious board game possessed by dark magic to young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd), a boy with no clue just how far an innocent roll of the dice can take you. From the first ominous drumbeat the game utters, until the last fading tones it plays the film out with, Jumanji is a giddy rush of pure adventure, with a refreshingly dark and primal side to its mayhem. Alan disappears from the 1950's and we fast forward 25 years later. Young orphans Peter and Judy (Kirsten Dunst &amp; Bradley Pierce) are moving into his old family home, so fate (and those damn creepy drums) would have them find the Jumanji in the attic, and continue the game Alan started with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) over a decade ago. Suddenly every jungle creature, meteorological phenomenon and 90's CGI monster erupts from the game into their little town, causing a mess that goes beyond the word havoc. This includes a near feral middle aged Alan, now played by Robin Williams. Together with a most reluctant Sarah, the quartet try to stop the destruction, play the game, but mostly just survive this onslaught. Psychotic monkeys, mutant mosquitoes, an elephant stampede, monsoons, giant spiders (fucking shudder) and crocodiles are but a few of the wonders awaiting them. My favourite has to be murderous Victorian game hunter Van Pelt, played mightily by stage actor Jonathan Hyde, with a pith helmet and an epic mustache that would make Kurt Russell chortle. Hyde does excellent double duty as both the deranged hunter and Alan's stern but loving father, a tough contrast he handles like a champ. I admire the film's willingness to go creepy and dark, despite being geared towards kids. The danger feels real, the game has an eerie mysticism to it, a life of it's own that gives you goosebumps. Not often do family orientated films have a shred of real fear in them anymore, so let's count our blessings with this one, still holding strong today. The special effects are dated in places (those monkeys, man) and wonderful in others (that hardwood floor quicksand tho), but you have to cut them some slack, it being 1996 after all. Williams and Hunt have snarky banter that barely hides their love for each other, and it's one of my favourite on screen pairings he ever had with a gal. He makes Alan resourceful, kind and just a little bit crazy, but the guy did spend years alone in a treacherous jungle straight out of your nightmares, so that can be expected. Amidst the chaos you can look out for Patricia Clarkson, a deadpan Bebe Neurith and David Alan Grier as well. There's a lot of stuff crammed into the film, but never does it feel bloated or crippled by it's own weight, flowing nicely and taking time where it can to develop character and give it's human cast just as much to do as all the crazy jungle stuff. I'm surprised I never saw any of this go down as a kid, because parts of it were filmed blocks from my neighborhood, and CGI was scant back then, so much of it would have physically been there, large and loud. Maybe I did, and have since forgotten. I definitely haven't forgotten any of the film, though, and allow for repeated viewings whenever I have the time. It's one of the best, most thrilling adventure stories of its time and ages well as each year passes. Cue the drums. An enjoyable board game, so an enjoyable movie!; This is one of the movies that I really enjoy, even if I do not like comedy and fantasy that much, by the way I don't like Robin Williams either, he thinks he's a funny person, but he isn't, some of his movies like `Jack', `Good Will Hunting', and some others are quite bad. Most of his movies leave too much to be desired. He's just annoying, because it seems to me that he thinks that everybody who sees him will laugh at the ridiculous things he does, he enjoys making fun of the human body, women, men, etc. I dislike it enormously; however I must say that I really enjoyed this movie even though he was starring and the visual effects were obviously computerized. I was impressed by the originality of Jumanji. It's such an innovative, interesting and enjoyable movie. I liked it because the plot is extremely original, creative and gripping. Who on earth would be able to think of a game like Jumanji? An imaginative game in which journeys, action, fantasy, and perhaps a little bit of terror surpass all things. I like this movie because it teaches us to enjoy everyday to its fullest, we see that Alan Parker was a frustrated kid at the beginning of the movie, but after staying in the jungle until the dice read 5 or 8, he realized how worthy his life was. Also it teaches us to respect others, for instance we see the little boy who began to turn into a wolf after cheating on the game was crying and Alan who was a grown-up person then yelled at him, and made him feel bad, but after that he was sorry since he remembered the way his father yelled at him, so this is a valuable lesson, since it shows that parents must be patient and loving to their family, but sometimes love can be hazardous to them. `Jumanji' is a nice movie for all ages; it's a very risky, but enjoyable game, in which your life is at stake. The board game (Jumanji) was good looking, it was really mysterious and interesting, whoever saw it would love to play it. Overall the movie was a very good one, I enjoyed every minute and especially Kristin Dunst's performance who also played in \"Spiderman\", I also enjoyed Mr. Williams's performance, I'm glad he at last did something worth it. Anyway it was an enjoyable movie, but I'd have loved this if it had been more dramatic, terrifying, sad, etc. 8/10 Not board; Watched this on TV where it was aired as a tribute to the late Robin Williams. It's an enjoyable family-entertainment fantasy adventure with Williams playing a grown man who as a boy was sucked into a mysterious, dark board game called Jumanji, freed years later by a couple of young children who happen upon the game when they move into Williams's character by this time run-down house. Along with Williams also fully-grown girl friend of the time Kirsten Dunst, the four of them brave everything the game throws at them to finish it and free Williams to return to his old life. And does the game throw everything at them! Crazy monkeys, a roaring lion, a jungle which comes to life, hordes of stampeding elephants zebras and rhinos and one very persistent big game hunter. A veritable special effects fest, while the plot amounts to no more than awaiting the outcome of the next roll of the dice on the board, it all makes for good clean exciting fun and who amongst us as never enjoyed playing a board game as a child. The back stories about Williams being bullied as a child, having a fractious relationship with his dad and his adult wooing of Dunst are lightly drawn but all of course resolved happily ever after by the end. Williams is fine after he makes his delayed first appearance, portraying yet again a child trapped in a man's body just as he did in a line going back through Peter Pan in \"Hook\", \"Popeye\" all the way to his breakout part in \"Mork and Mindy\". Dunst offers good support and the kids aren't too gauche and sentimental either. Nice to see \"Cheers\" Bebe Neuwirth get a decent part too. I wouldn't call it Robin Williams defining role but as an update on the old children's matinée features, this was an entertaining feature made the better by Williams engaging performance. R.I.P. to him. Brings back a lot of memories. Still a good ride.; My Take: A terrific special effects-laden adventure. JUMANJI is among those films I strongly remember from my childhood. Along with JURASSIC PARK and its sequel, JUMANJI is among those films I enjoy watching multiple times just to see creatures wreck havoc on a crowded street, monsters crawl in from the dark and other bits of special effects extravaganza. I strongly remember the elephants and rhinos stampeding around the crowded streets, a giant man-eating flower with vine-like tentacles, those messy (and weakly done CGI) monkeys with antics borrowed from GREMLINS, the crocodile and the shot of the house breaking apart. What I didn't remember was how faulty the dramatic interludes were. Which is exactly the point. JUMANJI is a wildly entertaining special effects extravaganza that works much better that way. Director Joe Johnston, who revived old-fashioned pulp adventures with THE ROCKETEER and later made JURASSIC PARK III so much better than it might have been, is such an accomplished action director. JUMANJI is a terrific and highly entertaining, if sometimes perilous, family adventure, though it does make several rest stops for back-stories and a bit of drama which sacrifices the pacing. The movie opens with two kids in 1969 with two kids curiously playing the titular game board which eventually unleashes African bats in the fireplace and sucking in little Alan Parrish (then played by Adam Hann-Byrd) inside the game. Forward 26 years later, someone else has bought the old Parrish mansion and the two new kids (Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce) dig up the old board game in the dusty old attic and give the dice a little role, and all hell breaks loose in town. With a little help from an older Alan Parrish (now played by Robin Williams) and his now older best friend Sarah (delightfully played by Bonnie Hunt), they try to finish what they started, unleashing more special effects behemoth after another. That's just about the \"plot\" of JUMANJI, yet I can go on forever with its visual treats. While the CGI doesn't live up to today standards (not to mention the totally unconvincing CGI monkeys!), but some of them in particular (including the terrific sequences where elephants and rhinos rampage around town and inside the mansion living room) still are eye candy. And, courtesy of director Johnston, there are still well-orchestrated moments of excitement. Stars Hunt and co-star David Alan Grier as a cop having a bad day provide the laughs. Despite some dull moments, which have a very major thing to do with its weak writing department, JUMANJI is still an amiable piece of entertainment. Still worth a look, but you might have the options of fast-forwarding to the really good parts. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5. Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... All sorts of things; As a child Williams is \"captured\" by bizarre jungle survival board game.  He emerges 26 years later when the game is next played by two orphans.  Williams and Hunt give it their best and a young Dunst is effective, while the movie itself is alternately poignant, absurd, mildly if broadly humorous, and very uncomfortable.  If you've bought into the premise and can follow it through the finale is very satisfying. The graphics were superb; This movie was a real hit in our family. The action was intense all the way through. You didn't know what to expect. It was so good I ended up buying it on tape. I recommend anyone reading this should do the same. Think of it as Night At The Museum meets a board game; Jumanji is based off a cartoon TV series that was made into a film in 1995 and stars funnyman Robin Williams who plays a man called Alan Parrish who as a kid played a board game called Jumanji which was been buried since 1869 with his friend Sarah(Bonnie Hunt)in the year 1969.But when Alan plays the game he gets sucked into it as his friend Sarah watched in horror as each time the player plays the game consequences occur and the only way to finish the game is to play the whole thing. Fast forward 26 years later in 1995 and two young children played by Kirsten Dunst (from the Spider-Man franchise)and Bradley Pierce who's parents died along time ago are now living with their aunt as their aunt bought Alan's old house.But when the two kids stumble across the board game as they hear the drums playing in the background in the attic,its up to them to try and finish off where the player left off and free Alan who helps them finish the game with his friend Sarah. But will they finish the game. Overall this film is really good until the very end which was sorta confusing for me. If you seen it you know what it is but it involves time travelling back to 1969 and then back to 1995 again. But still if you are a fan of Fantasy movies,Robin Williams and if you love something to keep you entertained on a lazy Sunday afternoon Jumanji is worth checking out. A lovely little film; This four year-old film, I would highly recommend for anyone out there in fantasy-land. Nice special effects, a very good idea behind the plot and Robin Williams all ensure a thoroughly enjoyable experience if you like action-comedies without the ubiquitous \"Good vs. Bad\" show-down. Jumanji is very different and well worth seeing. I look forward to the upcoming Jumanji 2 next year;  the cast for Jumanji 2 probably needs to include Gerard Depardieu instead of Robin Williams!!!! :-) A little adventurous... and childish.; Jumanji is a great idea.  The movie has great potential and could have turned out excellent and a true action classic. However, some aspects of the movie prevent that.  For example, the monkeys in the kitchen and abroad hardly look like monkeys.  They look like warped, evil, demonic beings with fur and tails that were only made to cause mischief.  Well, sure, you might say that's what the game meant to do, but come on... I think they should have used real monkeys here. Certain parts of the dialogue are a little corny and make one feel as though we're watching \"Spy Kids\", which can sometimes really ruin the feel that they're in a life-or-death situation. The acting was great (some parts it was not), and as usual, Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst put on an above-average performance. The action and crashes and other sequences are a contradiction, in a way.  Here we have fake-looking monkeys, but superbly crafted action. The music, composed by James Horner, is quite dull and does not help get you into the spirit of the movie.  A lower-than-average job on his part. Overall, this movie is really good.  I would suggest watching it if you can get past some annoying areas of the movie. My Childhood; This movie made my childhood. I love Robin Williams movies, Jumanji introduced him to me. Jumanji is a movie that everyone should watch. Robin Williams will again make you appreciate living as he always does in his movies. The movie contains full of fantasy objects. The writer has a really great imagination. I will make my children to watch this movie after all years that pass. While watching this movie as a kid, I was scared, excited and happy. It makes you to feel every kind of feeling. This indicates that the movie has done a good job. I again recommend to everyone. Jumanji appeals for all ages. I am pretty sure I will watch the movie again when I get old with the same emotions when I watched it in the first time. Action and adventure for the kids, and Robin Williams for the adults; Find a comfortable chair, lay out the board, grab the dice, and get ready to play.  But remember:  once you start this game, you can't stop.  If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must. \"Jumanji\" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  The basic premise stays the same:  a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure.  When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things.  Only finishing the game will make it all go away. In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added.  Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself.  He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing.  The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams!  Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter. Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles.  He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt.  The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the \"This is MY baby\" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike. Parrish House's Plans; Hi there! I would really appreciate if you can help me with this. I really love that movie, cause of the old Parrish House. I am planning to build my own house by the end of this year and the model that I have in mind is Jumanji's Parrish House. Of course, watching the movie any architect could design the exterior facade, but it has been really hard to find the floor pans. Does anyone have idea of a web page or any source where I could find the floor plans? In advance I thank you for your help. Kind regards, Ralph A great movie; JUMANJI I loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today! The movie is about a boy who finds a board game called Jumanji. When he takes it home and starts to play it with a friend, he soon realises that this is no ordinary game. He gets sucked into the game and is not released again until 26 years later 2 more kids find the game and release him. Now he is grown up and has to find a way to end this game before everything it releases destroys the town. Due to the sad passing of the genius that was Robin Williams, the TV channels have decided to show all of his movies. Jumanji was the first one I saw. The story to this film is like not her that I had seen before. It was an original idea (unless there is another film I don't know about) that was just so imaginative. It works really well and has a great adventure element about it. The effects are average. This was made in the mid 90s so that probably has something to do with it. The animals were obviously not real. You could see the lion was so mechanical it made me laugh. And the other animals were so obviously computer generated. But it was comical and that just added to the fun of the film. The acting was great. The main character was played by Robin Williams. He was as energetic and full of character in this role, just like he brought to every role he took. Other cast members were Jonathan Hyde, a young Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bonnie Hunt. Bonnie Hunt was brilliant. Her reaction and facial expressions made me laugh a few times in this. Another stand out performance was by David Alan Grier. David was so funny as the cop. His comedy timing was excellent and deserves a mention. This film really does keep you entertained throughout and is just a lot of fun to watch... Even now nearly 20 years later. I will give this 7 out of 10. Normally I end my reviews with a quote from the movie, but this time I just want to say how gutted I am about the news of Robins death. I am a fan of his work. I watched Mork and Mindy when I was a kid and grew up watching Jumanji, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam, Jack etc... There were so many great films that he made. I always saw Robin as so full of energy and full of life. He had one of the greatest smiles in Hollywood and when i saw an interview with him, he seemed so chirpy and happy. It just shows that in front of the camera, you never know what is going on in people's heads. I was sad to hear he had been suffering from depression. Depression is such a deadly illness. I know this sounds stupid, but I am gutted that I was not there to talk to him, help him. I hate to think that he felt so alone, especially as he had millions of fans all over the world that knew him on screen. He made the world laugh out loud so many times. Even through bad times in my life, watching his movies has put a smile on my face. Robin deserved much more happiness than he got. He gave so much to me and the rest of the world and it doesn't seem right that he should end his life this way. I will miss seeing new movies from him, but will always continue to go back to enjoy his old ones. Robin will live on in my house and he will always continue to make me smile. R.I.P. Robin Williams. Built around special effects that haven't aged well; I remember watching this film as a kid and loving it, but revisiting it now is like watching a different film. 'Jumanji' has lost its magic. It came across much better a few years ago, when CGI and special effects weren't as common as they are today. Unfortunately, with the film being so special effect oriented, it hasn't aged well. The effects are dated now and just don't have the same impact as they used to. Having said that, this is still a moderately entertaining film with an interesting and original plot, based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsburg. Robin Williams is excellent as Alan, as you would expect. I enjoyed this film a lot more a few years ago, but it hasn't aged well and has lost its magic. A breathless unforgettable adventure!; I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind... This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure. Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story. Great! 10 out of 10 from me! Excellent!; There is only one way to describe Jumanji: excellent. The plot is very, original, with outstanding concepts packed into each individual scene. After viewing this movie, the wild side of the jungle gets into you, making you want to dare to play the game. Although the computer animation may not look all that real, I still give this movie a 10/10, for an outstanding plot, casting, and spirit, which any great movie has. Entertaining...but one major problem; Jumanji is an entertaining movie. I'm surprised its IMDB \"User Rating\" is only 5.9. I would give it a 7. However, I don't understand why the kids (and Robin Williams) keep playing the game. With every roll of the dice, they put their lives in more jeopardy...along with the lives of everyone in the city. They could have stopped anytime after the bats or the mosquitoes or the monkeys or the lion. But they kept going (under the guise of \"finishing the game is the only way to make everything return to normal\"). I kept yelling at the screen, \"Stop playing Jumanji and you'll be okay.\" Of course, if they had stopped playing the game, then there's no movie. Good fantasy movie...; Well the Jumanji is just a great movie which shows how life is filled with luck and chances... The concept of game of dice is so good and the movie will be a bit of thriller too because we will be curious what may come next when they roll the dice each time.... Williams did his Alan character well, i almost felt like crying when Alan came to know that his family is no more.... The only backdrop of the movie is the monkey. It seems so unusual..... Overall, a good movie everyone could watch....:) Enjoy... :) Game Over, Man; Spoilers herein. The reason this film was made was because they could do the effects. That reason has no power now, and in fact most of them already look a bit cheezy. But there are some interesting elements: --Kirstin Dunst at her peak. --Robin Williams in his best role. Or rather for the role best suited to a manic comic. --A pretty cool house, one of the best in recent memory. --Some clever time folding. --A screenwriter's wet dream: in addition to creating a film world that sucks in viewer into an artificial reality, to have that film world contain another one. That world-within-the world is exactly as far from the normal world of the film as it is from us. Just like the film, it grabs us once we start and won't let go until the end. Clever idea. Not exploited. Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements. I love this movie so much; If you do not love this movie you are crazy. Its filled with action and excitement. I love Sarah Whittle played by the famous Bonnie Hunt. I also like Carl Bentley, a clueless police officer played by the comedian David Alan Grier. This movie is so creative. My sister and I watch the movie every weekend, we do not get tired of it. This movie did not get the awesome rating it deserved. People sometimes do not understand a quality move when they see one. I would strongly, strongly, strongly recommend the movie. Trust me you will love it to death. If you do not... then you are odd. Please watch the movie, try it you'll love it...duh!!! i miss my childhood; 6.6,,,,,,,,,,,,, i don't believe this. 10 people 10,,, anyone who have watched this as a kid will give this a 10... common for heavens sake,,, this is the best fantasy movie that some one could wish for as a kid.......... for heavens sake this movie was not made keeping logic in mind please,, its just fun,,, thats all it is,,,this movie is one of the best memories A KID OF 90S HAVE AS A KID,,,people who hate this movie can go to hell,,,, any parents out there please let your kids watch this,,, they will love you a lot..these are the kind of movies which make me miss my childhood ,,, Throw the dice and take a turn, Jumanji made the critics gurn.; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and based on Chris Van Allsburg's short story of the same name. It stars Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Jonathan Hyde. The story is about a weird board game that when played unleashes hazards from the jungle with every throw of the dice. Once you have started playing you have to finish the game for normality to be resumed. Simple in plot and coming off as an excuse to show off some impressive effects-said the critics- Jumanji defied the critics of the time to become a box office winner and a family favourite. Enough of a favourite to spawn a sequel (Zathura 2005) , an animated TV series and a board game. In truth the film is reliant on its effects to entertain, with the cast (all competent and enjoyable) merely lurching from one perilous throw of the dice to another. But to call the film shallow is wrong and ignorant. There's flecks of bad parenting, peer pressure, grief and bullying, while the impact of a missing child on one town is a noteworthy addition to the story line. You wonder if those critics actually paid attention during their free viewings?. Yes it's berserker family fun, but it's not without worth in the writing too. Besides which, for the action set pieces and the laughs-they alone mean the film has its merits. 7/10 Entertaining family/adventure/fantasy; Released in 1995, \"Jumanji\" is fun movie about a mystical board game from the 1800s, which is found in 1969 leading to the mysterious disappearance of a rich boy. The game is discovered again in 1995 by two orphans (Jonathan Hyde and Kirsten Dunst) who play the game and bring back the lost boy now an adult (Robin Williams). The only way they can stop the havoc the game causes is to finish it. Bonnie Hunt, David Alan Grier and Bebe Neuwirth are also on hand. Patricia Clarkson has a small role. \"Jumanji\" is a great example of the way youth adventures should be done. It's entertaining from beginning to end for children, teens and adults. If you've lost sight of your inner-kid give \"Jumanji\" a try. What makes it worthwhile for adults, besides simply being fun, is that it contains compelling themes and everything ties-up for a moving climax. Plus Bebe Neuwrith looks great (she played Frasier's psychologist babe on Cheers). The movie runs 104 minutes and was shot in Maine, New Hampshire and the Vancouver, British Columbia, area. GRADE: B+ a game not like the other ones; \"Jumanji\" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game \"jumanji\" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy. Epitome of Moronic Hollywood Film-Making; A previous reviewer wrote: \"A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie.\" I agree in part and disagree in part with that comment. The problem is impossible to pinpoint, because there are PLENTY of \"big problems\" with this movie! \"Random hazard generator\" is the PERFECT description of the ancient board game! Random hazard after random hazard until the game ends is what is supposed to pass for \"plot\" in this movie. Did anybody count how many times the game board fell out of and back into the players' hands? That, too is supposed to pass for tension. Ultimately, the film fails because there isn't any development of the back story. What was the origin of the game? Now, that would have been an interesting question to explore! And how does the game work? All we ever see is the game's projection of \"random hazards\" OUTWARD into the reality of the players, but somehow Alan (Robin Williams) apparently was sucked INTO the game. How did that happen, and why doesn't it happen to any of the current players of the game? Actually, the guy in the pith helmet is, more or less, the human villain in this movie, but he is never more than an inexplicable, evil cartoon. Was he, too sucked into the game like Alan, or is he the sole human \"random hazard\" generated by the game? Why is he so determined, not to hunt animals, but to MURDER Alan? The film just glosses over the fact that this sub-plot is actually one of premeditated murder! The hunter guns for Alan simply because the plot demands it. But the movie makes no attempt whatever to explain the character. Never once did I sense any genuine emotional chemistry among the characters. Just a bunch of actors acting - not INTERACTING. The love story sub-plot felt obligatory, never genuine. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt never generated enough chemistry to make me care whether Alan and Sarah got together in the predictable end. All in all, this film has the germ of an interesting idea that is really wasted by focusing on mindless, non-stop \"random hazards,\" poor CGI effects, \"lots of screaming and running around\" and insufficient character development. Except for the precise nature of each \"random hazard,\" the whole film was disappointingly predictable, including the cliché of the almost-kiss in the midst of peril routine. How many zillion times has that been used? The dialog is a similarly endless stream of clichés. The issue was never HOW the game would end - but WHEN. The more interesting issues were never even glanced at. This kind of movie can only appeal to people raised on video games. It was generated by that kind of adventure-for-the-sake-of-adventure mentality, and it has that same kind of feel. This rocks!; Jumanji rocks! The effect of everything is awesome. If Jumanji 2 ever comes out it better be good cause it would be a put down if it was terrible. Robin Williams is a great actor! You could have not picked a better person for the part of Allen. The jungle; This is an excellent movie for all ages. Congratulations to the cast, production, stunts and all the people. And now I want know what's happen in the jungle when Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) was there for 26 years. This should be a good adventure. pretty good, except...; Jumanji is an enjoyable, and at times exciting family adventure. Only one major flaw: the special effects. Jumanji relies on special effects for impact. Nothing wrong with that, only its so easy to tell that they are special effects. Enough fun to get you to sit through it, but they should really find another effects crew next time. 2/4 Exciting Family Adventure; In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called \"Jumanji\", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished. Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human. The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like \"Dead Poet's Society\" or \"Good Morning, Vietnam\"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality. This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor. Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the \"Narnia\" stories). Fortunately, any moralising in \"Jumanji\" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of \"alternative timelines\". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10 Probably not perfect, but very fun; Jumanji is a highly imaginative and very fun movie. The visuals are good, and the story is creative and exciting. The storyline consists of a man being sucked into a board game. 26 years later, two kids find the board game and set him free. However, the game board has already released a few dangers, and those dangers must be stopped. The only way to do that is to finish the board game, and the animals (or whatever else was released from the game) will be put back into the game. There is action and minor thrills, and the movie emerges as being a fun experience. It's kind of creative, and it's an excellent adventure film. Sure, it is a bit cliché'd and the monkeys look pretty corny, but don't let them distract you from the overall enjoyment of the movie. 6.5/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment. An entertaining, chaotic adventure, one which impressed me as a kid and still does now; I first heard of this successful family adventure movie at school in the late primary grades. It must have been new to the VHS format at the time (meaning I missed its successful theatrical run), and a student in my class brought a copy in for show and tell. I think I was interested in seeing it for months before I finally did. I remember watching it more than once on video in the summer of 1996. After those months of anticipation, I don't think I was let down, even if it did seem weird and scary the first time, with all the chaos. I guess I wasn't used to seeing that in films at the time. I've watched it again twice in recent years, after growing up, and both times, I found that it was still entertaining, unlike some movies I enjoyed in my childhood. In 1969, Alan Parrish is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Brantford, New Hampshire, with an upper class family. One day, after being ambushed by a group of bullies, he hears a mysterious sound of drums coming from a construction site! At the site, he digs up a box, where the sound is coming from, a box which was buried there 100 years earlier! Inside, he finds a board game called Jumanji, and takes it home. When Alan is at home by himself after a falling out with his father, his friend, Sarah Whittle, comes over, and he shows her the game. They begin to play it, not realizing how powerful and dangerous it is! Alan is sucked inside, and Sarah is chased off by bats that come out of the game! 26 years later, two kids, Judy and Peter Shepherd, whose parents have died, move into the old Parrish house with their aunt Nora. The siblings hear the drumming of Jumanji from up in the attic, and find the game. They start playing the game without a clue, just like Alan and Sarah did, and dangerous animals begin to come out of it! Also, Alan is finally released after being trapped in the jungle for 26 years! He learns that the year is 1995, and sadly, his parents have passed away. He must now continue the game with Judy and Peter, and reunite with Sarah. The four of them are all players now, and they must finish the game if things are ever going to go back to normal, which will obviously be very risky! The film starts well with the spooky 1869 sequence, when the box is buried out in the dark. After that, it's usually pretty good around the beginning. During the first of my two latest viewings, I remember finding most of the movie dull before Robin Williams comes in, but with my last viewing, I didn't find that to be the case. There isn't much humour during this part of this film, but there is some suspense. When Williams does make his boisterous entry, that's when the humour starts. After that, there's both excitement, with all the action and chaos, and humour. Williams provides laughs with his antics, but the film doesn't rely entirely on him for the humour. Sarah's reluctance to continue the game in 1995, the scene with Van Pelt, the trigger happy hunter from the game in a gun shop, and Aunt Nora and Officer Carl Bentley witnessing some of the Jumanji animals are also funny. Other merits of \"Jumanji\" include some poignant moments, good CGI effects (even if they're not the best, and have been topped since then), and decent acting, which includes decent child actors, unlike some films. All these things are what I think makes this film good family entertainment. really fun movie , Robin Williams excellent as always; Jumanji like Ghost , I surprised myself with the note in Metascore , very low, only 39 ?, the film is very fun , obviously in terms of the film script is weak , plus the cast is good, great Robin Williams as always Kristen Dunst young , and also participation as a police officer David Alan Grier , and his scenes are funny, the special effects at the time are acceptable , plus some people may not like , since the film is not as present (one of the big reasons because I support the remake will have Dwayne Johnson , Kevin Hart and Jack Black) , has good fun characters , some are boring , have really nice moments , and the end of the film hinted that would have a continuation , Jumanji is a good movie , is an excellent pass time , where we see Robin Williams do what do best , take the viewer smiles . Note 7.5 A walk in the memory lane; We (me and my brother) used to watch a cartoon named \"Jumanzi\" every Wednesday, back in 2000. Watching this movie talk me through a walk in my memory lane. The great Robin Williams also makes me nostalgic. 26 years, struggling and surviving, and than fighting back to get their life back. It is called human spirit. Though, every bit of it is fantasy, the plot become more human, when Robin remembered his saviors, who give him another chance in the game. A fairly lively jungle jaunt.; I think when Jumanji was released ten years ago, it was probably an attempt to cash in on the recent success of Jurassic Park. Both films have similar ideas. Using CGI effects to bring all manner of creatures to life. Although not quite as successful as JP, I still found Jumanji an exciting film. Beginning in 1869, in the town of Brantford, New Hampshire, two boys are hurriedly trying to bury something in the woods. This certain something doesn't take kindly to it, and protests in the form of jungle drums. Just before they leave, they pray for the poor soul who should ever find it. We cut to 1969, when young boy Alan Parrish is drawn to a construction site by the mysterious sound of jungle drums. It leads him to a chest. When he opens it, he finds a board game, JUMANJI. Alan has no way to know he is about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime! Showing the game to his best friend Sarah, they become enthralled in the game's seemingly magical powers. It's pieces move by themselves. Words appear in a crystal at the centre. And things have a tendency to come out of it when they roll the dice. Things take a nasty turn when after Alan rolls a 5, the game pulls him into it, where he remains trapped for 26 years. A new family move into Alan's home, Judy (Kirsten Dunst), Peter, and their aunt Nora (a woefully underused Bebe Neuwirth). The game calls to them as it did Alan and Sarah, and they end up releasing giant mosquitoes, a group of mischievous monkeys, a ferocious lion, and a fully grown Alan Parrish (Robin Williams). Alan barely has time to register how much time has passed when he realises there are more rules to JUMANJI then he thought. Everything that has come out of the game so far will stay in our world until a player reaches the end. But getting to the end is easier said than done. The more moves they make, the more dangerous things come out of the game. Reuniting with an adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), our foursome must tackle JUMANJI'S dangers and finish the game once and for all. Although there's not much to Jumanji plot-wise (a trait it shares with Jurassic Park), there are enough thrills and spills going on you'll barely have time to notice. No sooner have our heroes survived one deadly encounter, the film throws in another. That type of dynamic is really what drives the film, and there are times where Jumanji feels repetitive. But it has a decent cast to carry things along nicely. Robin Williams plays it relatively straight, but then I usually prefer his more dramatic roles to his larger than life ones, so it didn't bother me. And compared to most of the sugary shite he was churning out during this period, Jumanji was a nice change of pace. Bonnie Hunt adds some of her own comic touch, who's been left a nervous wreck after witnessing what happened to Alan as a child. The children are not that bad either. That's one thing I like about Joe Johnston's films. The children in his films actually have a shred of dignity to their characters, and are not nearly as precocious as they might have been in the hands of a less able director. Jumanji is certainly imaginative. We get quite a menagerie of creatures on display. Stampeding elephants and rhinos. Giant spiders. Man-eating plants and vines. This could all be a mite too scary for younger kids. But I first saw Jumanji at the age of 12, and I loved it. There are nice touches of humour throughout that help offset the scarier scenes. And there's a funny running gag about a policeman's car that gets slowly wrecked by the different things coming out of the game. Unfortunately, when it comes to the CGI, the effects are nowhere near as dazzling as Jurassic Park's dinosaurs. The filmmakers just haven't got the hang of using CGI. The monkeys especially look fake. And some of the animatronics could have been handled better. Those spiders are very jerky when they move. But the film more than makes up for its shortcomings in the action scenes. Joe Johnston seems to get a certain glee watching his CGI creations running rampant destroying everything, in much the same way Joe Dante did in Gremlins. It's certainly not a boring film. The indoor monsoon is my favourite part, where Alan has to wrestle a crocodile! It's fairly inventive too, when Alan nearly gets swallowed up after the floor turns to quicksand. And the earthquake. Brilliant! If you can simply switch your brain to autopilot and try not to think too much, you'll be in for a fun ride. Overall, Jumanji may be a bit shallow, but you'll find it difficult not to get sucked in.</td>\n",

       "      <td>very funny.; This film has some of the funniest lines and it's a great comedy. One would probably think, even I, thought that this would probably happen between two older men who fight about the obvious: women, fish and each other. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are a perfect pair. Even though it's a comedy, the romance in it is on the clean side. Nothing too distasteful and the comic relief is still included into the romance, which gives it a continuous comic flow. Even though there is a serious part of the film where John's father passes away, after that scene the film is back to the comic feel, which is nice because there's no dwelling on the sad/serious scene. Nonetheless, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh hard. Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. Is it better than original?; Is this movie better than the original? Perhaps. It's probably funnier than the original. Walter Matthau's pick-up line is one of the funniest things of the movie. But is it better than the original? The original had more of the emotions of Lemmon and Matthau as they fought. This one has less feuding (but still has some of the old pranks) and more focus on the family / dating relationships of the old men. This movie is funny and definitely worth watching. You'll have to decide on your own if it's better than the original. Back For More!; CONTAINS SPOILERS John Gustafson and Max Goldman are back in their first adventure since their last. It's six months later and they're still fishing. All the snow has melted and the neighborhood looks very different. The boys are out to catch a giant legendary fish they've heard tell about.          These men would soon discover big changes happening. Like, their friend Chuck, who died in the last adventure, had operated the bait shop. Ever since his demise, it's been empty, but some people have come with plans to turn it into a ristorante (restaurant). They are: Mama Regetti and daughter Maria. John and Max don't want that to happen so they pull numerous pranks on the Regettis but they still won't leave.         Jacob Goldman and Melanie Gustafson contemplate matrimony. But have their doubts when their fathers insist on planning the event. But when the kids decide the wedding is off, John and Max are back at it. Pulling all sorts of foolish pranks on one another. Max steals John's outboard motor, John wrecks Max's fish net and has his cat scratch up Max's car seats, but Max sends a big dog through John's house. Ariel decides to leave for a while. John was in a real pickle. He tried asking his father for advice, but he had passed away; Max goes on a date with Maria and they decide they like one another.        Pretty soon, it's a wedding day. En route to the church, Max and John decide to fish for the giant musket they're so fond of. They catch it, but John says they must leave it in the lake out of respect for his father, so they do and rush to church. It looks like the wedding of Jacob and Melanie, but it isn't. They eloped. It's the wedding of Max and Maria. John planted Max's dog in the limo as they drive off.        Was this as good as the first? Sure. I'm sorry to say that the three main stars, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith are no longer with us. Meredith died in 1998, Matthau in 2000 and Lemmon in 2001, which is real sad. So it's guarenteed there will never be an Even Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple III. They were really funny men. Why do the good ones always gotta die? But anyway, if you're a fan of these men and you enjoyed the first one, then I recommend Grumpier Old Men! - Delightful acting and script but silly scenes...; Always delighting in Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, warmed by their aging and childish pranks, I enjoyed this film which is filled with delightful acting and fun script.It suffers, however,  from more than a few silly scenes. Funnier than the first!; This movie is downright hilarious with tons of good one-liners. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (may they both rest in peace) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max &amp; John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says \"Holy moly\" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor! Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. One of the best movies of 1995!; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. 7/10 stars. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Grumpy, but not funny; What, I wonder, does the legendary Billy Wilder think of this film starring Lemmon and Matthau, the great team he so memorably paired in 1966's \"The Fortune Cookie\"?  Wilder's film is a dark, cynical satire, and was the first of what is now seven films starring the pair.  Seven films, but only two of them--\"The Fortune Cookie\" and \"The Odd Couple\"--are genuinely funny efforts showcasing these actors' combined talents.  \"Grumpy Old Men\" was mildly amusing due less to the script than to the welcome return of Lemmon and Matthau who hadn't been on screen together in 12 years.  The unexpected box-office bonanza naturally inspired a sequel, but all this equally lucrative outing has in its favor is a brief monologue by Burgess Meredith who, as Lemmon's 95-year-old father, boasts of eating bacon and smoking Camels while the \"experts\" who warned against such vices are taking a \"dirt nap.\"  Not even Lemmon and Matthau can enliven the script by Mark Steven Johnson this time around.  The curmudgeonly Matthau admitted he didn't lke the script for the first film but did it to work with Lemmon, and that the only reason he did the sequel is because the first film was a hit.  No doubt, \"Grumpiest Old Men,\" the inevitable sequel, will be just as dreary. If these pictures make big bucks, why tamper with the formula?  Why hire Billy Wilder to punch up the quality when the public seems content merely to see Lemmon and Matthau rather than see them at their best? \"Good Lemmon &amp; Matthau Comedy Sequel!\"; Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Kevin Pollack, Daryl Hannah and Burgess Meredith star in this 1995 comedy sequel. This takes place about 6 months later where John (Lemmon) is now married to Ariel (Margret) and he and Max (Matthau) are sort of getting along. This time, Max finds romance when he meets Maria Ragetti (Loren), an Italian widow who moves into town and opens a restaurant. Jacob (Pollack) and Melanie (Hannah) are also engaged and things start to get a bit difficult for them which makes their dads feud with each other, but only temporarily. The late, Meredith (Rocky) also returns as John's father and this was his final film. This is a good sequel and like the first film, it provides laughs and a bit of heartfelt moments as well. I recommend this. It has it's moments; Howard Deutch decided he wanted to cash in on the success of Grumpy Old Men and it worked. The only problem to the sequel is that some of the cast seem to be a bit bored by the proceedings. The one liners are enough to make you drop your popcorn. Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon are a joy to watch as they continue to find ways to drive each other over the edge into insanity. And yet Deutch calms that insanity by giving us a quick glimpse into just how much these two men mean to each other when Jack's dad played by Burgess Meredith dies. Lemmon and Mathau are still at the top of their game in this film. In this film the Ann Margaret character is suppose to be the rock, the sound of reason, the calm in the midst of the storm. You believe she is until she has the insanity thrust upon her and is forced to react. For the most part Ann Margaret as well as Daryl Hannah seem bored throughout the entire film. Kevin Pollack is just as good in this sequel as in the original. Burgess Meredith is the scene stealer, he manages with dead pan accuracy to deliver some of the best one liners in the film. Ann Morgan Guilbert manages to match Burgess with her ability to respond to his one liners with shock and outrage befitting her character. And then you come to Sophia. Sophia is in her comfort zone here. Sophia is comfortable with the slapstick comedy and relishes it, she's in the movie, she's not walking through it. She's absolutely stunning to watch but at the same time she adds to the moment. She's as glamorous as ever but it doesn't get in the way. All in all a good follow up to the original. A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances...; A sequel to the thoroughly enjoyable Grumpy Old Men, 'Grumpier Old Men' is A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances. The sequel has the spirit of its prequel &amp; the amazing cast, led by the impeccable talents of the Late/Great Jack Lemmon &amp; the Late/Great Walter Matthau, are in full form! 'Grumpier Old Men' Synopsis: John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. 'Grumpier Old Men' works well as a romantic-comedy, as it has moments of humour &amp; subtle romance. I loved the prequel &amp; I must say, the sequel doesn't fail to deliver. The film has sustained its energy &amp; wit, that one would expect from it. Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is entertaining, although initially the pace is slightly slow. Howard Deutch's Direction is top-class. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is good. Editing also is ably done. Performance-Wise: Lemmon &amp; Matthau shine all through. Its their sheer on-screen chemistry, that alone is worth watching the entire film. Sophia Loren is top-notch. Ann-Margret is impressive. Kevin Pollak &amp; Daryl Hannah leave a mark. Late/Great Burgess Meredith is memorable in his part. On the whole, 'Grumpier Old Men' is a smooth, relaxing watch. forget the fussing; As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Sweet and Sad; In this bright sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\" we find John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) at it again. The rivalry never stops. This time, they are bickering over their children's nuptials, almost causing a wedding not to occur. Sophia Loren co-stars as Maria in this foray into the land of 10,000 lakes as the new girl in town that Max has an eye for. At first, they both hate one another because she is turning his beloved tackle shop into a restaurant. Comedy ensues as Max and John both try to get the restaurant shut down and condemned. Eventually, as in the first film, love finds a way. However, sadness veils over as well when Burgess Meredith's character dies. Other than that, the film is very enjoyable. great; This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in 1995, 2 years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie 8 out of 10. Grumpier Old Men Too Sedate *; While Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were an excellent team, they bombed in this film but good. What's so grumpy about Lemmon in this film? The prequel was much better. Ann Guilbert, as Sophia Loren's mother, is given little to do. Remember her as the grandmother to \"The Nanny?\" Sophia Loren, other than marrying Matthau, is also give nothing to do. Ditto for Ann-Margret, Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak, all of whom were so good in the original but are reduced to practically nothing here. I also resent Matthau, who shows off his part-Jewish heritage marrying in a church at the end. I found this to be offensive. Sorry, but that's the way I am-old fashioned. To all those criticize me for the last statement, how would you have felt if the Matthau-Loren nuptials had taken place in a synagogue? While I realize that this was a comedy, this still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. A non-religious setting would have been the only solution to this. Sophia, twenty years later at 80, is still spectacular.; I saw a picture of Sophia on her eightieth birthday, demurely covering herself with a sheet and a heart-melting smile. All I could think of was the scene where she hitched up her bra and marched through the bar, and every man looked, and I do mean every man. I read later that she had \"improved\" the script for that. A reviewer in the SF Chronicle wrote later that she said she had had no \"touch- ups\", and if so then \"her genes need investigating.\" I remember her many films where her beauty was so natural that it was a wonder any man could concentrate on his lines. She never traded on it, but on her talent as an actress. Carlo Ponti was a lucky man: beauty without guile, talent without pretense. Italian pizza were like street food. When she heard we had so many pizza parlors, she thought we must be a poor country. Then she visited, and dined on American pizza. She reconsidered, gracefully and graciously. The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from 1995. The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe 8yrs old, and must have seen it over 100 x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it 15 minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. charming and funny light romantic comedy; It may be just me but I found Grumpier Old Men way way better than Grumpy Old Men. I laughed more and got involved in the plot much more. That it is totally 100% predictable every step of the way is only one of its charms... its how you get there where the fun is. And these actors turn in surprisingly memorable performances for such a slight film. I thought Sophia Loren turned in one of her most charming and funny performances, as did everyone else. The story was just more interesting and three dimensional than the first film and flowed more organically. The story line is simple ancient classic romantic comedy that these veterans had done so many times, it seemed for them like doing a well-known dance. The fun is not in surprises but in going through the old steps with joy. The actors move through their paces with simplicity and enthusiasm and the film actually captures very well the effects of love. The whole film hangs together and works in a way that, for me, the first one didn't. It gets airborne. It deserves a higher ranking than my seven except the story is a little too well-worn. It also allows the two protagonists to get a little more real with each other. Even the three charismatic animal actors get caught up in the spirit of fun. One thing about the film that gave me trouble was that all four women being courted in the film are talented, accomplished, strong and magnificent while all four of the men are hamstrung. I found it mysterious that these women, dropped by some miracle into this tiny town, would be so strongly attracted. Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. Mini Ha Has In Minnesota; It's just possible that the intention was to shoot four Grumpy Old Men titles featuring the four seasons because after the Winter setting of the first one we are now in Summer though theoretically such a cycle should have begun with Spring and ended with Winter so maybe the cyclical thing was an afterthought. Whatever we have virtually the same cast doing virtually the same thing with one absentee and two replacements one of which, Anna Guilbert is actually a native of Minneapolis adding a touch of authenticity. If it was unrealistic that Ann Margaret - who, after all, was teaching English at university and would by definition have access to dozens of eligible males - would marry Jack Lemmon in the first film it is equally unrealistic that Sophia Loren would wed Walter Mattheau here other than for feelgood reasons. On the other hand it's probably churlish to nitpick in this way when the film is only intended to entertain. Which it does. the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. The good, the bad, and the just plain miserable...again; It's not uncommon for a movie sequel to do little to the formula that made its predecessor so financially (and hopefully critically) successful. The old \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" method of filmmaking has been used in the Hangover, Home Alone, and Taken franchise to only modest success in terms of quality. However, in Grumpier Old Men, the sequel to the fine comedy Grumpy Old Men, handles the rehashed formula better than many film sequels do. While I'm getting to sound repetitive and out of descriptive words, this is largely because of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's chemistry together on-screen. From the moment they appear, it's almost impossible to believe the men's friendship in real life wasn't lifelong and consisted largely of playful torment, vulgarity, and several boys nights out. Had the film been a sequel with few returning cast members (say Lemmon and Matthau were substituted by two other actors), this sequel would've likely been a somber affair to view. In a way, I'm thankful the town of Wabasha Minnesota hasn't really changed much since our last outing, with the exception of John Gustafson (Jack Lemon) marrying Ariel (Ann-Margret) from the original film. In the meantime, John's dad still lives off a diet of beer, cigarettes, and bacon and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), John's cantankerous neighbor, still finds himself engaging in petty neighborhood battles with John about outwitting the other man. However, the big ordeal this time is not competing for a new neighbor's love but trying to save a local bait shop from becoming a \"restaurante\" for Italian cuisine. The restaurant is managed by Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren), a gorgeous but uncompromisingly strict woman who catches the eye of Max even as him and Jack plan to foil the restaurant's forthcoming prosperity. Other events (aka subplots) occurring in Wabasha are the wedding between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah), a plot which would later be used by the same director Howard Deutch in The Odd Couple II, also starring Lemmon and Matthau, along with John trying to get his father (Burgess Meredith in his final role, which was burdened by spouts with Alzheimer's and difficultly remembering lines, some female company as he gets older. One of Grumpier Old Men's immediate issues is that there is simply too much going on between plot-strands that involve marriage/romance troubles (I counted four including John's brief trouble with Ariel later in the movie) ad others that involve trying to sabotage the bait-shop-turned-restaurant. Grumpier Old Men may have too many new ideas for cutesy subplots, but it keeps the tone and feel of its predecessor alive and well. It still feels like Wabasha is the location of a sitcom with its oddball situations that seem to consistently bear hefty consequences for its residents, but its characters still feel like real people we've come to known and care about. Unsurprisingly, Lemmon and Matthau share unbelievable conversational beauty in the way they engage in simple discussions that seem to constantly end in uproariously funny bickering. Once you minimize your focus on that aspect in the film, you have just an average comedy that, while charming and pleasantly safe (a good and bad quality for this particular kind of picture), is just grateful to be buoyed by two very talented leading men. Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Sophia Loren, and Burgess Meredith. Directed by: Howard Deutch. Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the 1st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10 Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. 2/5 stars - John Ulmer Great!; This is a rare sequel. Wait a minute, sequels aren't rare. Well, that's true, but a *good* sequel is rare. Most of the time, sequels aren't even in the same league as the originals. However, due to excellent writing, a superb cast and great direction, this film is every bit as enjoyable as Grumpy Old Men. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made several films together and they worked together extremely well. The gorgeous Ann Margaret reprises her role from the first film and is now Lemmon's wife. A new lady hits town and Matthau is very interested. This lovely creature is played by Sophia Loren, who is still stunningly beautiful. Burgess Meredith is great as Grandpa. The stellar cast ensures great acting. However, this film is also written such that there is literally a laugh nearly every minute. I found the film to be highly enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh. 1/10; this movie sucked! I hate it! It's so boring! The acting is so bad! Why does Sophia Loren's italian character talk english to her italian mother when they're alone? The script is so bad! It's so corny! Max and John fighting with the fishing things is so silly! This movie was never funny! It was painful to watch, i'm telling you! Avoid it! Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Oh, How The Mighty Have Fallen...; GRUMPY OLD MEN (3 outta 5 stars) GRUMPIER OLD MEN (2 outta 5 stars) I dunno why I even bothered to watch the second one. Oh, I guess because it was on cable TV shown as a double bill with the original \"Grumpy Old Men\". I liked the original when I first saw it. It was not the best work by the Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau team... but it had its moments... these two actors could probably read pages from the phone book to each other and still make it funny. Unfortunately, the sequel has even FEWER of those moments. Still, I maintain that no movie with either Lemmon OR Matthau in it can be *totally* worthless. This is probably as close as they ever got, though. (Bear in mind that I have not yet seen their last movie together, \"The Odd Couple II\".) Practically the same plot as the first movie... Lemmon and Matthau play lifelong acquaintances and next door neighbors who are constantly bickering about fish and/or women. Burgess Meredith plays Lemmon's FATHER... and if you find old people talking dirty hilarious then you'll probably love his scenes (especially in the closing credits outtakes). Ann Margaret and Sophia Loren play the women in the grumpy guys' lives... hard to imagine that women as attractive as they still are would want anything to do with these two old dorks but, hey... I guess pickings are slim after 65. The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down. Pretty Dang Funny; John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. We often expect sequels to be weaker than the original. But sometimes we may be pleasantly surprised. In this sequel, the \"grumpy old men\" are still up to their old tricks, going after each other and teaming up to close down a restaurant. Some of it may be a bit far-fetched (in real life, a store owner would get the cops involved) but it's good fun. Sadly, the film has the distinction of being Burgess Meredith's final film. On the plus side, he really goes out with a bang. His acting and delivery of witty lines is top notch, and the film does a great job of hiding his Alzheimer's. You can really feel the talent in his character. Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Grumpier Old Men (1995) **1/2; More of the same for those who enjoyed the first film, nothing great but a decent time killer. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return in their twilight years as the ever-battling duo, but this time with the added attraction of Sophia Loren who still looks gorgeous at age 60. She winds up posing a threat to their favorite bait and tackle shop when she decides to take it over and turn it into an Italian restaurant. Since Lemmon's already got sexy Ann-Margret as his hot girlfriend, Sophia hits it off with old man Matthau (ah, the magic of movies), who does not look as good for his age (75). Burgess Meredith is better used in this one in his role as Lemmon's naughty old pop. **1/2 out of **** Cute sequel that works; Fun story of two older men who never quite outgrew boyhood, and the ladies they love. What a treat to see two master actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, working with silly material and enjoying every minute of it. The lady loves, Ann Margret and the ever-sexy and dazzling Sophia Loren, do equally well with a lightweight, sometimes over-the-top script. The principals are aided by a uniformly fine supporting cast, including Burgess Meredith as the Lemmon character's outrageously lecherous dad, and Ann Morgan Guilbert as Sophia's feisty mama. The older players' interaction is a delight. My only quibble with this film is the fact that Meredith's character dies without getting married like everyone else. Why? I wondered whether Meredith had perhaps expired during filming, but, according to Wikipedia, the actor lived a whole two years following this movie's release! The original film, \"Grumpy Old Men,\" takes place during a picturesque Minnesota winter, with snow used to charming effect. The follow-up capitalizes on a Midwestern summer. Like apples and oranges, both productions satisfy. A vibrant sequel that's still underwhelming; I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They seem to work perfectly together, and with a better script, this movie could be gold. We are taken back to Minnesota to re-visit the old grumps who now have to plan a wedding for their very plain and very boring children. There's a reason Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah have never had substantial film careers- they're very uninteresting actors. But I digress. If \"Grumpy Old Men\" built up it's laughs, \"Grumpier Old Men\" topples them down. The best moments of both films are when Lemmon and Matthau trade vicious insults at one another, and also play pranks on each other. But when this is taken away, we're suffering every old cliché in the book, including Walter's tiresome 'Wholey Moley' line which is used so much, it could be taken into context for a Shot Party (take a shot every time Matthau 'Wholey Moley''s himself). The other problem with this series is the fact that gorgeous women fall for these two farts. Roger Ebert made a very valid point in his review for this film- first Ann-Margaret moves into the neighborhood and marries Jack Lemmon. Now the even more gorgeous Sophia Loren has set her sights on the incredibly unattractive Matthau. And why? For concepts in the plot. There's no reason a woman as beautiful and intelligent as Loren would fall for the dull and disgusting figure Matthau is. I know this is a comedy, but come on now! All in all this sequel is peppier and a little more fun then the original, but both movies suffer from overblown dramatic passages that are not needed. We want to see the old guys go at it, not Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah. I laughed a lot at this movie- mostly at the incredibly underrated Bergis Meredith as the foul-mouthed Grandpa. Since all three main actors have passed, we'll never see them again. At least Margaret and Loren are still alive and kicking. I'd love to see their movie: \"Grumpy Old Widows\". As Good As The Original; Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\". I don't agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love \"Buddy Buddy\" and \"The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile. after you have seen the first there is no point seeing this one; After the fun of watching Lemmon and Matthau act like kids for less than 2 hours (i.e. from the first movie) I was satisfied, but then due to the success of the first movie the producers decided to give it another twirl, this time the story had the two starting off as friends thanks to the incidents that happened in the ending of the first film, but then some really really idiotic stupid reason, they were at it again. The movie was not funny as it was like a replay of the first, same pranks, similar plot and screenplay made this movie a waste of time. After getting a mate for John, they (the producers) decided to get a mate for Max, with nothing to write home about but a lame script that just showed no finesse or true plan, just the producers hoping to bank on the success of the previous movie. The main disappointment in the movie for me was Sophia Loren; her acting was just too weak for me to understand that she is a star. Everybody else in the movie even Burgess Meredith (who had Alzheimer's disease and this was his last motion picture appearance) was impressive, at least that I can give them. The movie is directed this time by Howard Deutch, who later worked with the duo in 1998 for Odd Couple II, Deutch other movies also have not been well received like Getting Even with Dad (1994) and The Whole Ten Yards (2004), which are basically the reason why I will not bother seeing My Best Friend's Girl. The movie plot carries on 6 months after the incidents of the first, where both John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) were getting prepared for the wedding of their children. Then a new arrival in town a beautiful lady by the name of Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) came in to change things by turning the towns bait shop to a restaurant. John and Max join forces to try and run the new lady out of town, but the issues between John and Max's children marriage plan caused both to reignite their feud as both refused to believe that their child was at fault. Only the ladies are alive till today (February 2013), as both Lemmon and Matthau died like half a decade after this movie release. Grumpier Old Men was a box office success in its own part, but a huge critical disappointment, as the movie cost 10 million dollars less than its predecessor and made like a million more in the box office. After you have seen the first there is basically no point why you should bother seeing this one, because it will stand in my mind as one movie I credit as a waste of time and talent. www.lagsreviews.com Good Laughs; Grumpier Old Men (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to Grumpy Old Men have Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau returning with more fights and foul language. This time out Lemmon is still happily married but Matthau is on the move and takes a special interest in an Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved to town. I think the most remarkable thing about this film is how well Loren looked. Even at 61 she's still a head turner and her comic timing isn't too bad either. I'm sure this film was only made because the first one made money but it doesn't really matter as no one should take this too serious as it's just a silly comedy meant to make you laugh. There are plenty of nice laughs here but I don't think it's as good as the original. This certainly isn't in the league as The Odd Couple but we do get a pretty good throwback to that film here as there's a scene where Lemmon has to spend the night with Matthau but can't put up with his dirty house. Ann-Margret returns but is pretty much wasted as is Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak. The perverted Burgess Meredith is back and steals the scene every time he's in it. Both Matthau and Lemmon are naturally very good and they easily slip back into their roles. It's priceless watching the two men work together even when the material isn't as strong as one would hope. Lemmon gets a special notice here due to a very touching scene with Meredith. Another problem is the direction, which has one of those \"made for TV\" feels to it. In the end this film could have and should have been a lot better but the cast make it worth watching. Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT 7 out of 10 OLDER, HORNIER AND STILL FRUSTRATED IN MINNESOTA;  `Grumpier Old Men' is a film that is a sequel to `Grumpy Old Men.' Reprising their original roles are Jack Lemmon as John Gustafson, Walter Matthau as Max Goldman, Ann Margaret as Ariel, Burgess Meredith as John's father, Kevin Pollock and Darryl Hannah as the children of Max and John. They are still next-door neighbors, only now the feud has subsided. Their children are living across the street in Ariel's house.  The marriage of their children is on the horizon. The setting for this film is summer and fall in Minnesota.  Fishing is still the main sport where `Catfish Hunter' is still the elusive prize.  The bait shop on the lake has been closed since Chuck passed away.  It is now under new management.  John and Max are anxiously waiting the reopening.  To their surprise, it is not being reopened as a bait shop, but a ristorante (restaurant).  Here enters Sophia Loren as the new proprietress Maria Sophia Calotti Ragetti.  Ann Guilbert who plays her mother joins her.  When Max and John find out the new plans for their favorite bait shop, they set out to undermine her plans for a grand opening.  A series of misunderstandings set off a domino effect that touches everyone's lives.  New loves are found and an old feud is rekindled. All of the same emotions that were in the previous film are in this film. There is laughter, sadness, anger and happiness.  Catfish Hunter makes his film debut, which, in essence, puts a `face' with a name.  His film appearance pays credence to the fact that he is a `real' fish and not just a myth.   The acting in this film is superb both by human and non-human.  Still having a good ol' time!; I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men back to back, so I could see both instead of my normal rent one sequel at a time ordeal. I just finished Grumpier Old Men this morning and was expecting a modest sequel, but it turned into a great sequel, pretty much to the point where I enjoyed Grumpier Old Men to Grumpy Old Men. Despite the fact that they use some old jokes, this was a fun plot and I thought the guys have gotten even funnier, including John's father, he's a little dirty, but so much fun to laugh at. John and Max are now best friends again and couldn't be happier with each other, their son and daughter are about to get hitched, and they are overwhelming with the wedding plans. Max is starting to get lonely though, since Chuck has passed on, the bait shop is given to two older Italian women, one lady, Maria, starts a little feud with Max wanting to turn the bait shop into a restaurant. But their anger turns into a hidden passion and they end up falling head over heals for each other, but Maria has some hidden skeletons in her closet. Grumpier Old Men is proof that you are never too old to fall in love or have your heart broken again. It was so sweet seeing Max fall in love with Maria, I loved their passion for each other, it was so fun to watch. John's father and Maria's mother were just so awesome and funny, they had such great chemistry! I would highly recommend Grumpier Old Men, it's a great comedy that once again touches your heart and tickles your funny bone. 8/10 funny funny; I, too, found the film very funny and until reading about it here couldn't remember who played the other woman with Burgess Meredith at the end of the film, the scene that made the whole film complete.  Without giving away what happened at the end of the film, the other woman was that gorgeous elder lady of many great films - Sophia Loren.  What a delicious surprise!  Good also for any old grumpy man! Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter &amp; Jack's previous films together. It was this film &amp; the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max &amp; John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. A sequel that's equal to the original comedy; The first go round was such a hit, that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau got together for this sequel to the 1993 smash hit, \"Grumpy Old Men.\" And \"Grumpier Old Men\" is every bit as good as the first film. It has some new characters and the scene changes from winter to summer, then winter and spring. Most reviewers don't talk about the surprise of the wedding in the first film. And I won't do that for that film or this one. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) team up for a time in the movie to plan the wedding of their daughter and son, Melanie and Jacob (played by Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak). And, later, to try to thwart the conversion of their bait shop into an Italian restaurant. Sophia Loren is the added ingredient for much humor as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti. She's a cousin of \"Spaghetti\" Ragetti, whom John and Max know. Her mother is in the picture, Mama Ragetti, played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. And, grandpa Gustafson is back, with Burgess Meredith now a couple years older. He tells son, John, as they sit by the lake drinking beer, that he sometimes thinks God has forgotten about him. The hijinks and capers in this film include some hilarious pranks the two friendly enemies pull on the Ragettis. As with the original film, this one supposedly takes place in Wabasha, Minnesota. While it is a real town on the Mississippi River border with Wisconsin, the filming for this and the earlier movie was done in a number of places around that area of southeastern Minnesota. So, anyone going to Wabasha won't find the fishing lake, the town overlook or some other scenes shown in these films. With the 10 films they made together  especially the nine comedies, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have delighted audiences for decades. May they outlive Catfish Hunter and continue amuse people for decades to come. Loren is still hot; Grumpy old men was an OK comedy with a nice performance by Ann-Margret, but otherwise forgettable. This film, on the other hand, has some real comic touches that actually also have something to say about the aging process - and life really doesn't end until it ends. But first the bad news: Daryl Hannah. I've liked her in other films, but she is so flat in this, she's a distraction. She doesn't have the feel for these characters, not even her own, and so doesn't quite fit. She's not even credible as the mother of the young girl who is so important in her relationship to great=grand-dad Burgess Meredith. There must have been some plot device they could have come up with to leave her out of the picture altogether; oh, well. Now the really good news: Sophia Loren. I admit I have always had a crush on her since I saw Houseboat as a kid; and when I saw the shower scene in Arabesque, i couldn't sleep for a week. Her performance here is splendid (romantic comedy is one of her strengths, after all), but the really really good news is that she was past sixty when she made this film, and she looks hot enough to burn a young man's fingers! Really - if I'd been Walter Matthau in that bar scene, I'd have gone out with a heart-attack right there - and smiling. With an adequate script, and such superb actors, Deutsch wisely lets the formula roll on without interference. Consequently, whatever the short-comings there's plenty to remember fondly from this film. Oh, and don't miss the blooper-reel that runs under the final credits - Matthau and Meredith are having a grand old time. Oh, and Sophia Loren is still hot. not much fun; Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still combative while maintaining their truce. John is married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) now and his father (Burgess Meredith) is still spry. Everybody is chasing after the big fish Catfish Hunter. Meanwhile, their children Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are planning to get married. Newcomer Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in Wabasha to buy the bait shop and turn it into an Italian restaurant. It's a continuation that's missing much of the fun. It is contrived. It's great to see these great actors working together but that's all I got out of it. I found very few laughs. Who would have ever guessed that it's the same place?; For the most part, \"Grumpier Old Men\" is pretty silly. Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still at each other's throats when Italian immigrant Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in town and throws everything into flux. What actually struck me most about the movie was how different the town looked in this one from the original. Obviously, it was a different time of year, but maybe the different look was meant to show how everything might be changing in the town. Other than that, Ann-Margret returns as Ariel, and she's still as free-spirited and vivacious as she was in the original. Burgess Meredith - in his final role - is still the grandfather who can exercise absolute authority over the youngsters, although he now has the hots for Maria's mother (Ann Morgan Guilbert, aka Millie on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\"). Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah also reprise their roles from the original...ah, and there's that fish. All in all, a fairly interesting movie. Not any kind of masterpiece, but it showed that Lemmon and Matthau still had it. Snoozing sequel with the leads in need of some No-Doz; Woeful, disappointing sequel to 1993's hit \"Grumpy Old Men\" is more retread than follow-up. The two crotchety neighbors--Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--bicker over their children (who will soon be making the sparring oldsters in-laws!) and, of course, who has the better fishing skills. They stop trading insults long enough for Matthau to begin irritating a new woman in town, a fiery Italian who has just opened her own restaurant. Sitcom humor with a sometimes-raunchy twist that is no longer fresh. Almost worth-seeing for Sophia Loren's funny, lively performance, but everyone else looks a little sleepy. Ann-Margret (who married Lemmon's character at the end of the original) must've dropped in for a day and a half to complete her work. As the youthful couple, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah are also under-used. ** from **** A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life &amp; Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau &amp; Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman &amp; John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a 7.4 out of 10 As equally funny as the original, but with an Italian flair!!!!; This sequel to Grumpy Old Men is as funny as the original. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and the rest of the cast from the original movie reprise their roles. John and Max are still feuding, but the tension between them has softened. There are, however, some changes: Ariel and John are married and there's a new girl in town named Maria Ragetti. She's moved to Wabasha to open up an Italian restaurant at the former Chuck's Bait place. When the boys discover what Maria's intentions are, they hatch a scheme to ruin the grand opening of the restaurant and try to keep Chuck's business going, even though the inventory of the former business has been cleared out and the interior remodeled to look like an Italian restaurant. Max and Sophia meet, but there's a disagreement about what the place should be. Maria goes to the neighborhood bar to try and reason with Max, but to no avail. It seems as though Max and John have trouble saying goodbye to what is no longer there. The humor between Lemmon and Matthau's characters is still spiced up and is still able to put viewers in stitches. Then, Max and Maria get married, and the restaurant starts selling bait, as well. Great movie, great cast, great fun!!</td>\n",

       "      <td>An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Feel Good Movie; The acting in this film is phenomenal, especially on the part of Angela Bassett who always does an amazing job (see What's Love Got To Do With It). The inter-cuts work well where they are placed, much like all of the other shots, and keep the films pace and the viewer interested. I've read other user comments and I find their opinions to be completely biased and unwarranted. If you're watching this film looking for profound insight to life you will be disappointed. This film is an adaptation of Terry McMillan's critically acclaimed novel FOR BLACK FEMALES. Waiting to Exhale explores the lives of four female friends. Each woman makes mistakes and has to deal with those consequences. But it is through being there for one another that they overcome these problems and others. For me, most of the negative user comments are from people who the film was not made for, that are only analyzing the film from the story. There is more to a film than it's narrative and when base your full opinion on that alone you are missing out. Plus, for me, it's just flat-out annoying when people who are completely not the target audience bash a film. Note: this is not to say that art cannot breach color, age or sex barriers. But be let's be realistic for a moment. If say, a heterosexual, black, 21 year old female studying Art was asking you for a good movie suggestion for a Friday night...Would you suggest The Dukes Of Hazard? I think not. Not unless you were joking. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Excellent for the broken heart...; Perhaps the reason they call this movie a chick flick, is because that's exactly who it's aimed at. Women. I don't see this as a man bashing movie, but more as a \"how do you deal?\" type of movie. It covers every situation: The unworthy co-worker, The drug-addict boyfriend, the gay husband, the cheating husband, the married man, the New Years fling, the sweet attractive neighbor, the teenage son....but most importantly, it show how women react and deal with the lies, the cheating, and the friendships between both men AND women...and how to survive from that. Any woman who has ever gone through a relationship can relate to this movie, regardless of race, situation, or age. You will want to scream, cry and laugh throughout the whole movie, and I can guarantee that every woman has got a little Angela Bassett in her, especially when she rips through her ex-husbands belongings. Two thumbs up...A definite must-see for any woman with a wounded heart. Don't Exhale Just Yet; I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It's not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others, it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However, the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria -- even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger, Holly Hunter, Alfre Woodard and others. Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight, insecure no-nonsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight, but she was the only one who found it (and deserved it). She was the only one who didn't sleep around, wasn't a man basher, set a good example for her son, and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face -- look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things, her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent, good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie. Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package --- beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life - she could now start her catering business, she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end. Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book, you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men. Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same -- Whitney Houston being well groomed, pretending to be well spoken and classy, and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise (although she might have been too young). The character had to tell us she was smart -- in a phone conversation with her mother she said \"I'm smart, I'm a good person and I work hard.\" Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills, doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end. This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn't \"tell this story\" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were. Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue? Extra in Movie; I was actually an extra in this movie and had a quite a fun time hanging out w/the cast/crew. I had an opportunity to be at several of the locations for days of filming and it was a lot of work. You don't realize what a day of filming entitles until you actually do it and I was just an extra. I was more interested in the process of the film making than being on camera so it was a great opportunity. I even got \"spoiled\" and met a lot of the cast and drove around in the SUV's that are for the main cast...fun stuff! I think over all the movie was to enjoy for fun. I think the basis of the friendships were the most important aspect of the film. That through all the craziness of men in their lives they were still there for one another. This film does Terry McMillan's writing no justice; This movie had great potential had it landed in the right directors hands (as seen with How Stella got Her Groove Back).  Many rough cuts, sloppy editing, and terrible lighting at times to name a few.  Casting was excellent with the exception of Whitney Houston who has the tendency to over-chew her scenes.  Though much of the book was not adapted to the film the strength and love amongst four friends was apparent.  It was the one thing that was not lost or left on the cutting room floor.  Good movie, better book. Waiting to Exhale (the movie) ***** (5 stars) Waiting to Exhale (the novel) ********** (ten stars) A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops &amp; horrible movies. My favorite movie ever !; I'm so surprised by the comments i read here. Since i saw that movie maybe 10 years ago now, it's one of my favorite movie ever along with boomerang.Maybe it's because i was fairly young when i watched those movies.. but i find them extremely good. I watched the movie before i read the book and it may be the reason why i loved the movie so much. Sure Whitney's acting could have been better but she managed to do a pretty decent job overall. As for the soundtrack it's a pure bliss for RnB lovers and i would say a classic now. The image of Black men in the movie is very negative but in a sens it pushed to be the exact opposite so it kinda shaped my vision and my life, and \"deepend\" my love of black women. Some parts of the movie are just so classic like the break up between Robin and troy on the balcony and the soundtrack at that moment was some kind of a symphony.. anyways great great movie .. enjoy Double Standard; So I finally got around to watching \"Waiting to Exhale\" on Encore the other night and I don't understand why this became a hit. (Note: spoilers ahead) As far as I can tell, the basic premise of this film is that all men are insensitive, callous and unfeeling; especially towards women. Okay, well and good. That is the storyline? Fine. Men suck, got it. But there is a huge double standard here; two of the women are dating married men and clearly, we are meant to be sympathetic about their plight as they whine and cry about not having \"their\" man with them at night in bed. How about this? STOP DATING MARRIED MEN! Maybe that's your problem in the first place. Now, on the flip side, Angela Basset's character is abandoned by her husband for another woman. Yet, if you pay attention, even this character is not completely innocent. When her husband informs her he is leaving, the things she says makes it clear she's known about his lover(s) for years but ignored his infidelities. Why? Obviously, because he's so wealthy. She liked all the \"stuff\" a little too much to have confronted him about it. Again, she's made her bed here, not as completely as the two who are actively cheating, but still. She spends the rest of the movie being so angry that he left her you never really grow to like her. Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer; he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar. With their clothes on, which apparently means it's oh-so-platonic and sweet. Then he writes her a letter months later, thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off, he'll contact her again. Did anyone else think this was more than a little sleazy? I would hope if I were dying of breast cancer that my husband wasn't out sleeping around (and I do mean just sleeping) with other women. Sweet, platonic, whatever; I think it's pretty horrible. Bottom line; the characters you're supposed to connect to are unlikable and the ones you're supposed to hate are just pathetic. Not very enjoyable. However, I did give it three stars for the music, which didn't suck too badly and the clothes and style. It's a nice little snapshot of how things looked in '95. And the print wasn't very faded. That's about it, though. Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life. Please. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation. A real disaster!; This movie is awful! The caracters are shallow and almost ridiculous, especially Lela Rochon. It's a very, very, very bad soap opera. I was watching this movie with my wife and we were laughing almost all the time. It is much too long, with no rhythm with absolutely no emotions. It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one cliché after another. Skip it, it's a waste of time! A One-Sided Celebration of African American Feminism; Directed by Forest Whitaker and adapted from a smash best selling novel by Terry McMillan, WAITING TO EXHALE is a glossy, but one-sided look at the relationship between four strong black women and the various men in their lives. The film is one-sided because the screenplay presents most of the male characters as sexist, manipulative pigs without a redeeming characteristic in sight, but the sensitive direction and outstanding performances keep the rather lopsided story watchable. Whitney Houston made an impressive film debut as Savannah, an ambitious television executive caught in a dead-end affair with a married man (Dennis Haysbert). Angela Basset does Oscar-worthy work as Bernadine, a woman who has spent her life being the best wife and mother she knows how to be, who has her world rocked when her wealthy husband (Michael Beach) calmly announces one night before a formal dinner party that he's in love with someone else and wants a divorce. The scene where Bernadine gathers all her husband's stuff and makes a bonfire out of it in her driveway is one of the film's highlights. Lela Rochon plays Robin, a not-too-bright doormat who finds herself pregnant by a man she wants nothing to do with. Loretta Devine is fun as Gloria, a hairdresser who is divorced from her husband, who it turns out was gay, and is struggling to raise her son (Donald Faison) and tries to begin a relationship with a new neighbor (Gregory Hines). If you can accept the fact that in the world of these four women, all men are pigs, then this film can be very entertaining but the top-notch performances by the cast cannot be overlooked. FAbuLOuS; Simply fabulous. I thought it was a great movie. I was completely empowered! It made me want to start my exes car on fire. Embrace your independence  watch this movie. (is great to watch with the scorned over glasses of wine and bon bons) It'll make you laugh, cry, get mad, and then plot getting even. I can waste a lot of your time telling you to see it, defending it from what others say about it, or just generally talking it up. But haven't you always wanted to see Angela Basset throw a fit? How bout cut her hair off? And who wouldn't want to watch Whitney act with humility. This is by far my favorite movie with Whitney - second, The Bodyguard - third, The Preachers Wife. Frustrating...; That's the word I'd use to describe the film, an adaptation of Terry McMillan's 1992 best-seller. It's not great, it's not bad, but it's frustrating to watch, and the fact that I'm of the male persuasion undoubtedly had something to do with it. Now, let me be the first to say that I did enjoy seeing a group of strong black women portrayed onscreen. To say that Hollywood has been exceedingly lax in this regard is an understatement. But it would've been nice if their collective talents hadn't been squandered on this disgustingly anti-male tirade. Especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine, who otherwise shine in everything their names are attached to. Good, solid movies about sisterhood are probably needed now more than ever, but not at the cost of shortchanging the good, upright, decent brothers out there, whom this movie largely forgets about (with some notable exceptions -- Gregory Hines, for example.) And the frustration doesn't end there. Both Savannah and Robin manage to find themselves involved with the most shady characters (a married man and a dope fiend, respectively), yet they complain about the lack of good men out there. I suppose it would be silly to question just where they've been looking, even though it might hold the answer. The sad thing is that there are fellas out there who have little to no regard for women (\"the scum of the f__king earth\", to quote Savannah), and women who fall for fellas like that for the most silly, shallow reasons. If it wasn't for Bassett, Devine, and Babyface's score, this movie would barely be watchable. As it is, it's a moderately entertaining diversion, albeit a frustrating one. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE HARD TRUTH) looked VERY beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts REALLY made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. I give this one 2 out of 10. Pathetic; This film is simply about a bunch of women who pick men who's behaviors they claim to hate &amp; then spend the rest of their time complaining about them. It seems that this view is held by many women &amp; possibly accounts in some measure to the number of women who consider their relationships with men to be unsatisfying. Decent; Those of you who ranted and raved about how horrible this film was really tickle my funny bone. I love to see miserable people hate a movie just because...well, they have nothing to better to do. Not saying this was the best movie I've ever seen. But I agree with others who say that Bassett and Levine are the ones to save this film from drowning with all the other horrible movies. I love Angela Bassett, I'm a huge fan of hers. The scene which depicts the morning after her husband leaves her for his secretary, which would've otherwise been too cliché for my taste had it not been for the way Bernie (Bassett) burned up that BMW! I mean that was classic. Sorry if any of you testosterone-fueled men out there will accuse me of man hating, but I love that scene and will watch it over and over again. Three cheers for Angie. And Devine's character, Gloria seems sort of weak and unable to stand up to even her teenage son, but I love how she bends a little and confesses how she feels to the late Gregory Hines' character. You'll notice Devine's Gloria and Bassett's Bernie are slightly juxtaposed but their chemistry is excellent. If you haven't seen it, check it out, if not for anything but the performance of these two gifted actors. Whitney ruined the great potential; Angela Basset was good as expected, but Whitney has no Range as an actress. The screenplay also neglected to portray, on film, the greatness of this novel.  Instead of promoting sisterhood, they emphasized the canine-qualities of men.  Read the book; rent Soul Food instead! Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this 1995 film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Hilarious in Parts; 1995 was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in 1995, the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection great touching story; While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life's mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great. WAITING TO EXHALE : Waiting To Go Somewhere, But Sadly It Never Does...; WAITING TO EXHALE Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. \"Waiting To Exhale\", Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book, had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it's star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene. \"Waiting To Exhale\" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone. It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn't know the word \"feelings\" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change. For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they've experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don't seem to learn squat. It's like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. \"Waiting To Exhale\" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose. ... D ... I wanna move to Arizona; I thought It was a great movie, although it is a lot of sleeping with other women husband that are taken, we all have to be honest, this goes on a lot in reality. it's not right, but it happens.... Overall I really enjoy the movie because it took me way back to 1995, the movie was great. great times, although I was just 11 when it came out, I remember all the hype over this movie from my mom n my aunts.... One factor that I've never notice before was the setting... It makes me wanna pack up my family an move to peaceful Arizona.. Great Movie. r.i.p. Whitney Houston I cannot believe it took me all this time to see this movie all the way through... Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... not bad; this movie and its story are quite good on the whole..........Ms Bassett is the leading and the best actress,for sure.I get her character.she's beautiful and I guess she's blown people away with her beauty and the EASE WITH WHICH SHE FASCINATES.Ms HOUSTON IS NOT TO NEGLECT NEITHER.She looks natural in this one.And despite her little experience as far as her actress career is concerned,she is good even though her story is a bit common .Loretta is divine!Anyways,this motion picture is merely good.There's nothing amazing.And it don't stand out from all the other movies.the only thing that makes me stick to the screen is the complicity and the crude humor on men of the four ladies! A bit too soapy but deserves respect for being a positive film for black women; Vannah is travelling to see her friend Bernie while leaving behind all her old live to start anew.  Bernie has just been left by her husband of 13 years for a white woman.  Robin wants to be loved and happy but always makes the wrong choices.  Glo has an estranged husband and the only man in her life is her teenage son.  The four get together through their struggles in love and live as they try to put it all together again. This is very much a woman's film and, as a man, it's easy for me to criticise it for being a weepy or for being a bit of a woman love in, so I won't.  The plot is pure soap opera, the lives and loves of our 4 women, however it is still involving as the four stories all have strengths as well as weaknesses.  The mix of comedy and sentiment is a bit too much 20:80 and at times the sentiment gets too much, but the sassy characters keep the interest. The soapy sentiment isn't helped by a poor soundtrack and poor use there of. In itself I like some of the love ballad r'n'b stuff  but here it felt like it was all over every scene.  This really bogs it down. Also a down side is the whole man hating thing  only a few come off looking good.  I thought the director being a man would help redress the balance but it seemed to have no effect. Why  can someone tell me  was Houston chosen to lead this talented black cast?  Was it because she could do a cut price soundtrack?  She's a poor actress and he spoiled her scenes  she needs to stay in TVM's.  Bassett however is powerful as ever and really steals every single scene she's in.  Devine adds comedy and sauce while Rochon is perfect as the vulnerable beauty going about love the wrong way.  The male cast is great too  there are so many well known faces in this with only two criticisms of them  1  everytime I see Haysbert now all I can think of is his 24 character.  And 2  Wesley Snipes' character just don't convince me at all. Overall to criticise this for being girly or sentimental is to miss the point.  It is actually good to see a film with so many good roles for black actresses.  It's a bit too soapy for my taste but it is funny and involving with a commanding Bassett.  Only Huston, a soppy soundtrack and constant man caricatures spoil it. The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Sticky; There was nothing in the movie that made me excited. The message did not come through,  if there was one. Perhaps it is to convey the idea that men are useless,  or that relations are complicated because women make it complicated. If a comedy,  I did not laugh.  If a drama,  I did not find it dramatic. It was like drinking a cup of coffee presented to you with way too much sugar. Good movie, Better book; This wasn't a bad movie. The acting was great (although Whitney Houston still seems mediocre). Some of the scenes were powerful and funny. However, unlike the book which also deals with the sisterhood of Black women, the movie becomes a long \"Men are pigs\" tirade that gets weary after a while. Plus it's sometimes hard to root for the characters. For instance, considering all the one-night stands Savannah has, it's hard to see why she's questioning her ability to find a good man. Overall, Waiting to Exhale, is basically a sorely-needed bonding movie for African-American women that, while a little biased, is good escapist fun. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about 15 or 16 and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker. 6 of 10 stars. This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Great female flick of the '90s!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track 6: This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! A 3 is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. Hot Soundtrack, Terrible Character Development; Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end.  It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.  However, much of this is wasted on poor character development.  Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover.  What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies.  While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all.  For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script.  Clearly the answer is that it isn't.  Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with.  Why the director didn't see this, I don't know. Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface. 4/10 Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. in response to your response; I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a 10, i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol \"Father 2\" : Born again.; Okay,now the sequel \"Father Of The Bride 2\",which was surprisingly better than expected. Like anyone who sees a sequel,you expect almost a carbon copy of the first. It does start similar to the first movie,with George sitting in a chair addressing us,the audience. It also does an unfortunate repeat of the fight between Annie &amp; Bryan,again like the first movie,I saw it coming. The baby shower party is not played big,like the first after wedding party but I laughed when actual storks carrying little bundles showed up. I was kind of \"iffy\" on the sub-plot of George selling the house,having to leave in ten days and then blowing a bundle to get it back again. I'm not questioning the probability (we know in reality that'd be impossible),I just found it kind of unnecessary. I did however like his dyed hair and new look,that was hilarious and he should have kept it until the end of the movie. Some may say the idea of a mother &amp; daughter being pregnant at the same time,is impossible. Yet,somehow it works here. It's not just the obvious next step for Annie but for George and his wife too,who thought having babies was way behind them. I love Steve Martin's warped expression when Bryan calls him a \"Grandfather\"! I liked that a woman having a baby in her 40's was taken very seriously,since it's a fact that women who have babies later in life have a more difficult time. It makes for a good piece of drama in a film that's otherwise a family comedy. The comedy is helped once again by the presence of Martin Short and I like that he becomes more involved with the family. Especially helping George out the front door on his back. This after giving him sleeping pills for rest. Once the babies are born and Bryan &amp; Annie head to Boston for a new life,the film gets a very touching ending with George and his new baby girl. 8 out of 10 for the expected repeat of ideas,otherwise a very well made sequel. (END) A (Rare) Good Sequel; The first \"Father of the Bride\" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin's great comedic \"Dad\" character with the emotions of marrying off his \"only\" (to that point!) daughter. However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor. Thankfully, \"Father of the Bride II\" does not fall into this trap. With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather. Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton). Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women! Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments. Whereas the first film captured George's equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George's identity crisis. With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family. Overall, this film is just as good as the original. The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare. Let's just say that if a \"Grandfather of the Bride\" were in the works, I would be first in line. I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. Fantastic; Both the first movie and this sequel are fantastic. I loved the first movie, so I thought I would give the second one a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised!! The acting from all the characters is amazing, from Steve Martin to Diane Keaton to Kimberly Williams-Paisley. 16 years after its release this movie is still a gem. When I'm feeling down or just need a go-to comedy for a night in, these two movies are the best. For those who say that a 40-something woman is too old to have a baby--that's just not true. Do your research. I bet more people have been in that situation than you think. Anyway, this is a feel-good movie for some great laughs and a few happy tears! Average comedy sequel; There's been better, and there's been worse. \"Father of the Bride Part II\" falls right in between when it comes to sequels of comedies. The plot was easily predictable and the movie didn't have as many Steve Martin funny moments as the original. There were some good moments that made me laugh though, most being scenes with Martin Short. It did seem like sort of a stretch, though that all of the sudden \"Frank\" was an interior designer as well as a wedding/baby shower coordinator. I guess they just needed a way to keep him in the movie longer. I was hoping for a lot more when I rented this. My advice: stick to the original. Very Warm and Funny.; This movie is a very warm and funny family film. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the Sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny. The only thing I didn't like was Eugene Levy's character, I found that his part was just put there to extend the movie a bit. I also didn't like how they used him in the second one when he was clearly the one who auditioned to be the wedding singer in the first one. All in all this is a great family film where many will enjoy and watch together. Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! Not as good as the first, but still great fun.; In the sequel to the brilliant Father Of The Bride, Nina Banks and her daughter Annie are both pregnant and George Banks, being his usual nervous self has to learn to get used to the idea that he's going to be a father again AND a grandfather. The whole cast including, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams and Martin Short are all back here giving good performances. Even though Father Of The Bride Part II is not as good as the first Father Of The Bride, this is still a great movie which is enjoyable and fun all the way through and that's why I'm going to give this good sequel a 10/10.  Good, so long as you don't try to think too much; It was a fun movie, but it had no particular substance. I mostly watched it because I'd seen the first one. And because it was free on my cable. Or at least, I wasn't paying only to see it. Now, I have done that before and been pleasantly surprised, but this just wasn't one of those movies. Most of what was in this movie has been done already in the first film, and then it was in a much better way. Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, I'm just glad that I got to watch it free. Sure, Steve Martin's always fun to watch, particularly when he's acting dopey for whatever reason, but that didn't make it a great film. Just mediocre. Still, it's fun for a laugh. Funny Sequel; Geogre Banks is getting used to life without his precious daughter Anne. Now he is thinking about all the free time he will have when his son is out of the house.That`s when Anne announces that she is going to have a baby.Geogre is shocked but he becomes even more shocked when he finds out his wife is going to have baby as well.Now he has to deal Franck helping out with the two pregnant women.Can Geogre ever get a break? This is my second favorite movie.My first is Father of the bride part I.This is a good movie.See it it is a great sequel.It is almost as good as the first one. Steve Martin steals the screen. Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. As I understand it, there were accusations of anti-Arab stereotyping?; \"Father of the Bride II\" may seem to some people like a lesser Steve Martin movie, with him as the patriarch from the previous movie now having to deal with his daughter's and wife's pregnancies. Unpretentiously silly. But one interesting thing is that apparently, some Arab groups claimed that the movie was making anti-Arab stereotypes, as a Middle Eastern man buys their house with plans to demolish it. I wouldn't have interpreted that as anti-Arab; I mean, it's not like they're portraying him as a terrorist. Oh well, life goes on. The movie's a nice, goofy way to pass time. I really liked the scene where they bring Steve Martin into the hospital (that would've sure been an embarrassment!). Also starring Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, B.D. Wong and Eugene Levy. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. good, but a mistake; this movie rocks. but there is one thing weird. okay, so in the beginning Annie says, \"i have lived here since i was 5!\" and then later right when they are selling the house and playing basketball Annie and George(her dad) and her dad says \"i remember the first time we played out here, you were 4.\" wait...so was she 4 or 5 when they moved in??????????? other than that this movie makes me laugh, cry(because i laugh so much), and..........uh.....what was that other thing people say when they say that? i don't really remember. i just love how Steve martin always is so cheap. I am forced to say more so i will say i love that this movie is always on HBO! And i realized something, Steve martin has had white hair like forever! Entertaining, but the premise has been worn thin -- it's sweet, but unnecessary.; The original \"Father of the Bride\" with Spencer Tracey is a really good comedy, the remake starring Steve Martin is a good sweet-natured, amiable enough comedy - and I don't really think a sequel was necessary at all. I mean the whole premise is basically the same - before George Banks (Martin) had to grasp the reality of his daughter being married, and now he has to come to grips with the fact that she's having a baby. A nice twist on this is that his wife (played by Diane Keaton) is ALSO pregnant, but nevertheless it's still (basically) the same as the first film in one form or another. Thankfully it doesn't seem like a total cash-in (like so many sequels of this sort do) because it has a certain charm (as did the first film) and is still remarkably entertaining, all considered. But you can tell it was made solely because of the success of the first film - even Martin Short is back with another extended cameo as Franz the wedding manager. Of course you may be wondering why he's involved with a pregnancy, since his business is weddings. Here's a hint: more $$$ for the studio. Martin is basically doing the same thing he did in the first film - the weary upper-class guy who feels overwhelmed by the state of things. Diane Keaton is still very sweet and likable as his wife. The rest of the cast (including Macaulay's little brother Kieran Culkin) range from OK to good. Martin Short, however, is yet again a stand-out and is very funny - he wasn't necessary for the plot but he is funny and a good addition to the movie regardless. Overall I'd say this is one of those sequels that didn't need to be made, but could have been a lot worse. It's sweet, it's got some good lite-comedy moments, and in general it's just an enjoyable family movie that isn't trying to be anything other than simple entertainment -- which it is. Good, but first one was better; This film is good but you have to suspend disbelief quite a few times. All the performances are fine, with Steve Martin a scream again, and Diane Keaton glowing from start to finish (she has a lot more to do here than in FOTB1). The best scenes are: George trying to get buff in the gym, asking which famous men he's younger than, pointing to his wedding ring at the lady in the car next to him, and seeing all the misbehaving children out the window in his car while his wife sees all the happy kids and their parents out her window. And of course, when George holds his child and grandchild outside the delivery room. My favorite line: \"Now going to the movies will be economical: one child, two seniors, thanks!\" Good; This is well worth seeing. Everything goes perfectly. Ain't no such thing as too much Steve Martin, baby. Here Martin carries weak material, but it's a positive movie that shows the joy a new child brings. You will laugh, cry and cheer. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Some of the dialog is a bit lost on US audiences, but still some hilarious lines. The music is amazing throughout. Also the scenery is incredible. I saw the cast had a lot of great comedians, so I thought there would at least be a few laughs. Instead, I was surprised to see a very touching movie, absolutely great script. I give it 7 out of 10. What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the 1951 sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of 50. This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! The Best Movie of All Time; let me tell you.. anyone who does not like the movie is just a little close minded.. i read comments that thought the movie was too unrealistic but thats what makes it so great! i mean look at other movies such as lord of the rings or star wars neither or them contain true reality.. this is why its a movie. Anyway, i loved Steve martin in this movie. he does a magnificent job of playing the character for an over protective dramatic father. he was the best actor. who could have played the part of Nina as well as Diane Keaton. she makes the part of the mom annoyingly overwhelming mother, which is exactly what the point of us as the audience to think of her. martin short is the best of all \"fra'nk's\". the way he seeks George banks's approval is perfect. and lastly Kimberly Williams is the gorgeous daughter we are all expecting her to be.. i watch this movie every night before bed and i can recite every word to this movie. because of father of the bride II i have dreamed to meet Steve martin.. \"hes my hero!!\" hopefully you fall in love with it too. and dream to be pregnant with your mother as did Annie banks. My comments are going to be very positive.; Hi! I think that Father of the Bride Part 2 was a great film and very hilarious. I think that the mother and daughter could have been pregnant at the same time!  It was a great movie and I recommend it to all people who want a warm-your-heart comedy! It's a great film! Thanks! Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the 1951 movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the 1950 classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the 4 year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com I really found this film quite annoying; My basic opinion of this movie is that it is a crappy American feel good comedy. It is simply about a man who is going through another mid-life crisis as his daughter, who was married in the first movie, has a baby in this one. The catch is that his wife is also pregnant and with the irony really dripping, both of them have their babies within minutes of each other. As such the kid's auntie is exactly the same age as him (it won't happen to me, though it is possible). When I watch this movie I think to myself, this guy really doesn't have problems. There are people out there that have much more serious problems than he does. He admits to having a beautiful wife who loves him, owns his own home (or did), has a great job and great kids - and he thinks he has problems. Maybe the whole comedy is in the fact that he is worrying about absolutely nothing, but seriously, when I watch this movie, I simply shake my head and think that the guy is a loser. I really don't think it is all that funny. In fact, the guy has much more serious problems. He seems to be spending an awful lot of money, and is going to find himself in a huge amount of debt, and he doesn't seem to ever be at work. My question is not only where he gets his money, but where he gets the collateral for all of the purchases he is making. He buys back his house for an extra $100,000 on top of what he sold it for, and really, how can he seriously afford it. Okay, it wasn't all that bad. As a movie is was made well, and I did chuckle a few times. But in reality, this guy is a serious loser because he has more than anybody could possibly ask for, and he is worried about growing old. Hell, we all grow old, but he has experience more than what a lot of us have already had. Instead of worrying about growing old, the twit should look back on his life and be thankful for the blessings that God has already given him as opposed to forgetting all of that and winging about his age. like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $15k bonus to move out in 10 days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $100k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. Father of the Bride II; Likable, but not as impressive a follow up to the 1991 hit with Martin now dealing with his daughter being pregnant...And, oh yeah...his wife is pregnant again too. Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie. Touching even in its weak state.; Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, and kimberly Williams Paisley return in Father of the Bride Part 2. The film as a sequel was slightly disappointing, but on the whole, likeable. George and Nina Banks are in for the surprise of their lives when they find themselves middleaged and expecting their third child.  The timing is impeccable as Annie Banks-MAckenzie also realizes that she is expecting. Thus Steve MArtin embarks on a nine month journey that will consist of him building a new room for the baby, watching his daughter become a woman and overdosing on sleeping pills.  Honestly, the film made me laugh hysterically and i shed a few tears at the bittersweet ending. 3 and 1/2 stars out of five. not bad for a sequel; as sequels go,this is film isn't too bad.i didn't think ti was quite as good as the first one,but it's not a bad effort.i didn't find it as funny,and some of Steve Martin's histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me.really,this one doesn't quite have the same sincerity as the first.through much of this movie,i was all too aware i was watching a movie,whereas with firs tone,i was drawn in,and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting.having said that,there are some bright spots.for,one,this movie is just as touching as the first.and Eugene levy has a great cameo.and there is still some fun to be had.even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above,i still think Father of the Bride II is a 7/10 George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in 1995. It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. 2.5 out of 5 stars. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. I loved it, but one thing bothered me...; I enjoyed this movie: Diane Keaton is my favourite actress, Steve Martin always makes me laugh and Martin Short is great, but I felt really sorry for Keaton having to pretend to be pregnant. She didn't seem to be enjoying it and when the Banks were at the hospital, she actually looked rather bored, because whenever she spoke from the moment George protested about the doctor's name, she almost made it sound like she was in a maths lesson. Apart from that, it was great! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching Martin, Keaton or Short in a movie or who likes to laugh. 9/10 because of the little problem, but it was great. I loved it. Better than the original; This one is definitely better than the original, funnier, smoother pace, and in some places, better acting! Plus Martin Short has more screen time. Great! This is a great movie for anyone who like good clean comedy. Awesome! Five out of Five Moose Stars! Father of the Bride Part II; The first film was the remake of the original version starring Spencer Tracy and Dame Elizabeth Taylor, and it became very popular, so naturally they felt like a sequel was needed to continue the story. Basically George Banks (Golden Globe nominated Steve Martin) is getting used to the fact that his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) has become the bride now wife and got married to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), and more surprisingly a mother when she reveals she is pregnant. With this revelation comes out George has a small midlife crisis, and he tries to recapture his youth, including dying his hair, but he does eventually settle somewhat and get used to the idea that he will be a grandfather. But then he is shocked to find out he will be a father again as well when his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) reveals that she is also pregnant, and it may appear that both her and Annie's baby will be born on the same day. With these things happening, and the house having leaks and termites there is the opportunity to change things by selling the house to Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy), but he changes his mind later. When George manages to get the house back, despite a higher price, he gets the help of camp wedding planner/coordinator, now interior designer, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) to make the baby rooms and get things ready for the arrival of children. There are a couple of false alarms from Annie where she thinks the baby is coming, but eventually it comes to the real thing, and they rush to hospital, and of course Nina goes in to labour as well. In the end George is very happy to be holding both his new baby son and his new baby granddaughter is his arms, before his daughter and her husband move away to their own new home. Also starring Kieran Culkin as Matty Banks, B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein, Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie and Jane Adams as Dr. Megan Eisenberg. I can see what the critics mean by giving it two out of five stars in certain places, it certainly isn't as funny as the original film, it concentrates more on the sentimental material, but that's not a bad thing for this comedy drama. Okay! No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. AWESOME!; This movie is great!  I think it's one of the best movies ever made!  I love both Father of the Bride I and II!  I think that it is cute how they have the mother and daughter pregnant at the same time!  I hope that they come out with a Father of the Bride Part III, that would be awesome! :-) Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video Worthy second installment.; Mild SPOILERS are contained in the following comments. However, I believe everyone knows the story and how it turns out. The fun of the movie is seeing the actors, especially Martin. Steve Martin is back as George Banks, having just lost his daughter and basketball partner (Kimberly Williams as Annie ) to marriage, and now she is back home with her husband and a big announcement. She is pregnant. Of course everyone is happy, and the joy is doubled when Nina Banks (Diane Keaton as Annie's mom) finds out she is pregnant too. Poor George doesn't know if he can handle all this. After all, he is about to be a grandfather, he's not prepared to be a new father also. Martin Short is back as Franck Eggelhoffer, the unintelligible wedding planner. All ends well as both mom and daughter deliver their babies at the same time, in separate hospital rooms, so George has to go back and forth. The movie ends a few months later, and as Annie and her new baby are leaving, she gives dad a miniature basketball, a reminder to George that he can raise another basketball partner. Father of the Bride Part II; The 1991 Steve Martin comedy proved out to be popular enough to earn a sequel, much like the original Father of the Bride of 1950. All of the main cast of the first film returns in a story where the eponymous father George Banks (Martin) has gotten over the stressful wedding of his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) and her fiancé Bryan (George Newbern). However, when she breaks the big news about her pregnancy to the family, the grandpa-to-be becomes anxious about getting older and starts proving his youthfulness in various ways, such as selling the family's beloved house to a greedy real estate developer Habib (Eugene Levy). Life has more in store for George and his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) though, as it soon turns out that Annie's is not the only pregnancy in the family. Again, the humour is best when it relies on Steve Martin's comical talent and charisma instead of craziness and exaggeration. Unfortunately, adhering to the rule of always making sequels bigger and louder, the writers have given more screen time to the unbelievably annoying wedding planner Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) whose noisy and flamboyant scenes are certainly the weakest parts of the whole movie. The fussy bumbling caused by the impending childbirths at the end is also rather annoying and unimaginative. I think the movie works best during the more subtle scenes, such as Martin making uncomfortable faces while hiding his nervousness or arguing about the baby's surname with the overjoyed family during a dinner. Besides the run-of-the-mill jokes, the movie also shamelessly wallows in impenetrable sentimentalism of the newborns' adorability. Especially the music is so unbelievably schmaltzy that it was really getting on my nerves while watching; can't the filmmakers just trust their material's appeal without burying it under a sweety-tweety sugar mountain? Nevertheless, despite the predictability of the plot and the not-so-hilarious jokes, George Banks is a very likable character and Steve Martin is at home in the role, so those who enjoyed the first movie will probably like this one too  the basic building blocks of the story have not been changed at all. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. This is my favorite movie; ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is my favorite movie.  I think it is funny, sweet, and truly touches the heart.  In the sequel to the previous, Father of the Bride, George Banks (Steve Martin) is finally getting over the fact that his beloved daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams)has gotten married.  But then she shocks him with the news that she is pregnant.  Everyone else is thrilled, but George is not.  He believes that he is too young to be a grandfather.  He tries to become young, but doesn't succeed.  Then, both he and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton) are shocked to find out that Nina is also pregnant.  George now thinks he is too old to be a father.  They have one other child other then Annie, Matty (Kieren Culkin.)  Through the chaotic turns of pregnancy, George learns to except the fact that his daughter has grown up and moved on, even though it is hard.  They also have to deal with Fronk (Martin Short,) the goofy wedding coordinator from the first movie, who is now designing the new baby's room.  They then discover that Annie has been given the opportunity to design a museaum in Boston, far away from their own, San Marino, California.  George now realizes that he will miss his daughter more then ever, but he learns to get along.  In the end, he enjoys being a grandfather to baby George, and a father again, to Megan, named after the doctor who delievered her.  In this funny and heartwarming sequel, everyone puts out fantastic performences once again.  Even though I very much enjoy Father of the Bride, I enjoy this much more. And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW2, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. Loved it!!; I thought the sequel to the first Father of the Bride just showed what a great chemistry Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, George Newbern, and Kieran Culkin, along with all the other supporting actors have together. I would actually love to see a Father of the Bride Part III and I usually hate more and more sequels. I really do enjoy this sequel and I think it is better than the first one. I would reccommend any and everyone seeing this movie (but not without seeing the first one). Not bad...but could have been better; The first time I saw Father of the Bride 2 I really liked it.  I still enjoy watching some parts of it but I thought some realistic parts in the movie were not necessary.  First of all, the mother and daughter pregnant together.  This could happen but probably when the mother is not older than 40.  Nina had to be at least 47.  Is it likely that the mother would be pregnant at that age? I don't think so.  Secondly, I could not understand why George and Nina wanted the baby to have two last names.  Children always go by their father's last name and I thought Brian's father made a good observation when he said that George and Nina already had Matt to carry on the Banks name.  So why they thought the baby should have two last names is beyond me.  In conclusion, Father of the Bride 2 is still cute and fun to watch in some parts but I thought the first one was much better Heartwarming &amp; Hilarious; Steve Martin does it again in this touching and funny sequel to 1991's Father Of The Bride the rest of the cast returns in a new story dealing with the joys of parenthood. I loved Father Of The Bride II not only because it was funny, mostly it was due to the comic antics of a man dealing with two pregnancies at once. He's a great comedian as well as an on screen father, my favorite scene is when both babies arrive at the same time. A year has passed since George Banks (Martin) watched his only daughter Annie (Williams) get married and has accepted her transformation from daughter to wife. She comes home with her husband Brian (Newbern) to announce the wonderful news to her parents, brother Matty (Culkin) and in-laws that she's pregnant. Everyone is thrilled and excited except for George who thinks he's too young to be a grandpa, from then on he tries to act young by dying his hair and exercising. But things are about to get a little crazy when his loving wife Nina (Keaton)discovers she's pregnant too now George must deal with the impending arrival of both his grandchild and his own child. Thrown into the chaos is Franck Eggelhoffer (Short) the wedding coordinator who helps to design a room for the new addition to the Banks family. This movie is not only sweet but it's charming entertainment for fans of all ages. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. 5/10 A really likable comedy.; I enjoyed this film. I found that it was easy to relate to Steve Martin's character George Banks as a parent. The relationship between him and his daughter Annie, played by Kimberly Williams, was an honest father daughter relationship. I recommend this one for parents in general and empty nesters in particular. The idea of a mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time is plausible and amusing. A Well-Done Sequel!; A sequel to immensely likable Father of the Bride, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is A Well-Done Sequel! Its enjoyable as well as emotional! 'Father of the Bride Part II' Synopsis: George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. 'Father of the Bride Part II' is worthy sequel of a wonderful prequel. The characters still appeal, the humor works &amp; the emotional moments are heartfelt as well. Nancy Meyers &amp; Charles Shyer's Screenplay is genuinely well-done. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography &amp; Editing are fair. Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains. On the whole, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is a satisfying sequel. Some of Martin's best work!; First, this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2. If run back to back, they run like one beautiful story. This production is great from start to finish. Everything about it is wonderful, including the story, the acting performances and the direction. This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor. His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances. He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man. This movie is no exception. His performance is comedic, yet startlingly genuine. Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's. I love this movie. I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character; with how he feels, and what he's going through. This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum, and I love it. It's less about family, and more about life's curves; the every-day things that make us crazy, happy, sad, and ultimately stronger. It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think, consider, ponder the events which have led us to where we are now. Combined, they rate 8.6/10 from... the Fiend :. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late '40's)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... daughter gets married; In the sequel to Father of the Bride we have the daughter getting married and moving away from home, this presents a big dilemma to the father played of course by Steve Martin. Maybe not quite as funny as the first one,, or as good,, but definitely above average,, it's always a pleasure watching Steve Martin work at his craft. The movie is basically about how the family,, especially the parents deal with their young daughter growing up,, getting married, and eventually moving away from the nest.. the cameo from Eugene Levy is just wonderful,, as a real estate agent who is trying to sell the very home where our main character lives.. all in all a very family friendly movie,, that I would recommend. Not as good as the first, but good family fun; This movie is as thin as you can get. Its' emotions are easily played. There are no surprises. It is very predictable. And I say...so what? What is wrong with that? This is an American Dream movie. Everything goes perfectly and everyone is as happy as can be. Why should it be a complicated character study? It deals with the birth of babies. There's no complex feelings that need to be dealt with in this situation. A life is being created. A family is being blessed. A baby's birth is a time for love and hope. This movie has both in spades. It's a very positive movie that shows the joy a new baby brings. Every parent-to-be should watch it. A child's birth is an emotional event with no equal. This movie knows it and milks it for all its' worth. My only complaint is it should have been called Parents of the Bride. Way too much time is spent with the relationship between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. There should have been more attention paid to Kimberly Williams. Not only were the scenes between her and Martin the best scenes in this and the original, but Kimberly Williams is the most beautiful actress to come out of Hollywood in many years. Forget all the blond, silicone filled, bimbos that every teenage boy raves about. Ms. Williams is a natural beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****. Like Cliches?; ...That weren't even funny the first time? I've seen a lot of films with Steve Martin in them, and they all made me laugh.  Until this one. Part one is worth a look..it may make you laugh a couple of times (I think I laughed once).  But I recommend avoiding this one all together. Deja Vu; I found this sequel to be both charming and entertaining. What I learned tonight is that this movie is actually a remake of the 1951 movie \"Father's Little Dividend\", which in turn was the sequel to the original \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and with the same great cast: Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Bennett, et al.  They both share the same broad comedy and story line (only one pregnancy in the earlier version though), and in their own ways are equally entertaining.  Old or new incarnations, however, be sure to see parts one and two in sequence. Not exactly the most innovative of films, but still great fun!; This is an excellent, funny, warming film. Although a lot of the \"same kind of thing\" was done in the first movie, it's still entertaining. Steve Martin's character was good, although at times his behaviour is quite pathetic and Martin Short is again entertaining. (Particularly his pronunciation of the word 'pregnant).' Although it's highly predictable and not the most intellectually stimulating of films it is still well worth watching and the vast majority of people would enjoy this film. Not bad, but inferior to the first; I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the first movie. It was not without sentiment and it was hardly original, but it was still beautifully filmed, well acted, charming and funny. This sequel is not as good as the first I agree, but I still quite enjoyed it. The story is predictable, and there are some so-so parts in the script. Eugene Levy, who I do like by the way, is okay here but his character felt somewhat unnecessary and felt like he was there as an additional character and to give the film a longer length. And I also would have liked to have seen more of Kimberley Williams, she is so beautiful and quite a good actress, but I actually do agree that a little too much time is spent between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. However, it is beautifully filmed, has a nice soundtrack, decent pacing and good direction. And the acting is fine too, Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are still very likable, and while as I've said I would have liked to have seen more of her Kimberley Williams was lovely. And I loved Martin Short here too, he was one of the main merits of the first film, so to see him in his wonderfully fluffy turn again was a very nice surprise. Overall, not bad at all, could have been better, but I liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox A so so sequel; 'Father of the bride' was a good film and probably didn't need a sequel. But this is Hollywood, everything needs a sequel. While it is clear that a lot of effort has gone into making this sequel work, the central idea stretches credibility and every idea the writer had seems to have been thrown at the wall in a desperate attempt to get laughs. There are moments that remind you of the heart and humour that the preceding film had, but it's a load of nothing really. I went into this film dubious about how good it could be, and I didn't finish watching it any more convinced that the original needed a sequel. Pretty much just a rehash of the first; As this movie started, it reminded me a lot of the first. Various scenes were reenacted, only a little wackier, sort of like it was trying to be a shade more funny than the first; I guess that is the usual stuff for this type of sequels, but I think it failed at that. Apart from that, the movie pretty much succeeds in being a good sequel to the first. The story is also somewhat reminiscent of the first one. All the same actors return as well, and they are pretty much the same, just a shade more wacky. The story is also told by Steve Martins character, George Banks, like in the first. Pretty much everything in the movie is a takeoff of the first; this doesn't make it bad though, if you liked the first, liked the characters, you'll want to see this too, if nothing else, to see the characters again. It is about as funny and as sentimental as the first was, and as enjoyable. Fans of the first one, or of Steve Martin will most likely enjoy at least some part of it, as this is the typical for both the first movie and Steve Martin. 7/10 Better than the first one!; I love Steve Martin, but I was disappointed by the first movie, so I wasn't expecting as much from this one.  But to my surprise, this one was even better! It's constantly funny, just like one should expect from Steve Martin; it's not preoccupied with corny emotion, like the first movie was. It's Steve Martin in his best performance since \"My Blue Heaven.\" Sometimes sequels can be surprisingly good.  This one is better.  It has all the comedic elements that were stagnant in the first movie.  It's everything the first movie should have been, and more!</td>\n",

While the animation is groundbreaking to say the least, it doesn't mean that it has a story to back it up.  I for one love cartoon movies, but this left a sour taste in  my mouth.  Maybe it's because in what is supposed to be a kids' movie, we see one character trying to \"off\" another character, out of pure jealousy.  The other toys were just annoying as the chorus, as they, like the leads, had a total lack of any real character.  There were some bad attempts at humor that didn't even win a giggle out of me or my family. Skip it and see Shrek or Ice Age.  Better stories to balance the animation. An unmissable film; From our first sight of Woody until his happy face disappears off of the screen the makers of this film keep audiences worldwide glued to the screen with eager anticipation. The films unlikely scenario where talking toys battle to save a fellow toys life is amazingly gripping and a \"must see\" which will keep the whole family (yes even the teenageers) amused. The more mature audience will recognise the \"spoofy\"side to the movie. This is most noticeable when plastic soldiers (who mimic the actors in \"Who saves wins\") jump off  bannisters with miniature parachutes and talk to each through baby monitering systems.!!! In conclusion, TOY STORY is one of the most thought out films in the industry as props and scenerycan not just be found lying around and everything had to be individually designed, crafted and computerised To Infinity and Beyond!; It was May of 1991, and Disney were on the brink of the Animation Renaissance which would bring about a treasure-trove of beautifully drawn and designed 2D films. Only a few months later would the first and very elegant Beauty and The Beast be released. But behind the scenes, they negotiated a deal with a small animation studio named Pixar, previously only animating shorts to demonstrate the capabilities of their computers. John Lasseter would serve as director after being fired from Disney as he pitched the revolutionary idea of the first ever fully computer animated full length feature film. And so Toy Story was born. It was a long and complicated production process full of worries about budget, and the infamous Black Friday reveal which prompted a production shut-down and a full script revamp. It's sequel would later nearly undergo a disaster of similar scale. But after an arduous process Toy Story became a ground breaking film in animation history and set the first benchmark for 3D animation. Toy Story is a beautifully rendered film for its time and eye poppingly gorgeous. Pixar's revolutionary animation process created a living breathing world with every tiny detail lovingly crafted - blades of grass, hairs on head, scuffs on floorboards. The character movement is smooth and seamless, the use of light and shadow realistic. Being Pixar's first ever feature film and under close scrutiny from Disney executives and given a small budget, short cuts like ponytails and short hair were used, and the textures of the background and minor characters are less visually impressive, but Tory Story still holds up remarkably well decades later. It's all wrapped in a stirring score by Randy Newman which easily accompanies the film's movement; lifting for Buzz's first take-off, eerily tip-toeing at the Spaceport Arcade. The main song You've Got a Friend in Me is heartfelt at the start of the film but even more-so at the end, Newman duetting with Lyle Lovett to symbolise the new partnership of Buzz and Woody. The story is a simple but universal one, with an original twist. What happens when toys are alive, and furthermore, what happens when they are replaced by newer, cooler models? The titular characters of Buzz and Woody are stunningly brought to life through fantastic character design and voice-acting. Woody is your classic Western cowboy with a pull string that spouts recorded catchphrases while Buzz Lightyear is a futuristic Space Ranger who has pop-out wings and a laser. Who can compete with that? Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide a great deal of emotion and character through their respective portrayals; in particular Woody's charm and leadership is a thin veneer for his insecurity and ego which is displayed when Andy gets a newer toy. Terry Gilliam singles out a great shot at the height of Buzz's personality as a Space Ranger, where he discover he is actually just a toy, and where the camera zooms out and the big bravado he was only a moment earlier is now a tiny figure. But apart from them you have a whole cast of iconic characters each with their quirks, personalities and traits; Mr Potato Head, Re the dinosaur, Slinky Dog, Hamm the piggy bank, Bo Peep, the plastic toy soldiers...We get the sense that these toys have been in the Andy household forever, and have formed a tight knit family and well-oiled hierarchy. the sequel 4 years later gives them additional screen-time which comes with more laughs (including the addition of Mr Potato Head's wife). Toy Story set the first benchmark for computer animation and heralded a period of critical and box office success for Pixar. The 2 sequels are also crafted with as much detail and care as the first, but nothing can match the first gasps of wonder and amazement at the movement and freedom of the 3D world when it first hit cinemas in 1995. An affectionate love letter to toys and film; This was Pixar's first feature-length film, the first full-length computer-animated feature film and the first film in the Toy Story series. There will be spoilers ahead: I could just say that this is a phenomenal film, a ground-breaking film and a must watch if you love film in general and/or animation in particular and leave it at that, but this comment would be rather thin if I did so, so I'll do a bit more here. I don't really need to discuss the plot, because, chances are, if you're reading this, you've probably seen this already. I'll do a brief sketch: this concerns a boy named Andy and his toys. Lifeless when humans are around, the toys come to life when none are in the room. Woody is the leader of the toys, but his place is threatened by a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. Andy and family are preparing to move. Through a series of mishaps, Woody and Buzz wind up being lost and must make their way back before the family leaves or be separated from Andy forever. After a series of adventures, they make it back and get on board before the family is gone. That's a simple story. The parts of the film are each so excellently crafted that it takes a simple story and creates gold. The animation still holds up, even after 20 years, which is an eternity in computer animation. The script is marvelous and the writers clearly show that they possess a love for both toys and film. The toys showing up in here are a mix of new (Woody and Buzz) and classic (Mr. Potatohead, Etch-a-Sketch and green army soldiers). There are gags referencing films as diverse as Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Wizard of Oz. Pixar also references the various shorts they'd made up to that point and TV shows like Star Trek and The Simpsons. The voice casting is spot on. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen nailed their parts. Don Rickles and Jim Varney were inspired casting choices and John Ratzenberger began an association with Pixar which continues today. The score and songs by Randy Newman are perfect, particularly the song, \"You've Got a Friend In Me\", which goes to the heart of the film. It's just an exceptional film. The attention to detail is incredible. Even minor characters turn out to have a significant influence on things, like the mutant toys in Sid's bedroom (Sid and his dog Scud are the villains here, Sid being a rather twisted kid next door). The look of everything is astonishing, though it has aged in 20 years. This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray is is well worth getting. Most highly recommended. The first of it's kind.; Toy story is the first Pixar animated film. Toy story amazed everyone on earth back in 1995 and still does to this day. That amazes us and so does Pixar. Bringing us some of the best films of our time. Nowadays we have Up, Ratatouille, Wall E, Finding Nemo. The list goes on. But we should remember the first one. Toy story stars Tim Allen and Tom Hanks as Toys. Hanks plays Woody, a cowboy toy who is the most popular from his owner Andy. That all changes when Andy buys a toy called Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen) who is an astronaut. Woody becomes awfully jealous and tries everything in his power to get rid of Buzz. There are other plot points that I would rather not go into. Toy story creeps me out a little. The thing about it that creeps me out is the villain named Sid. Sid is this toy murderer who lives next door to Andy and the toy gang. There is a part in the end when all of the toys retaliate. That part scares me every time. Watching these destroyed toys retaliate. I never thought something like that could creep me out. I guess I get creeped too easily. The first Toy story is a work of art. It's got great visuals and will creep you out. Kind of like Robert Zemeckis' A Christmas carol, which is another work of art I think. As I have said in many reviews, Toy story is a film that you'll never forget. I haven't. My memory is crap. Toy story:****/**** The first one will be remembered the most; The movie isn't just the first one in the Toy Story series, but also the first movie Pixar ever created and they didn't waste any time showing us what they could do. This movie shows what being creative is all about. The soul ingredient of the story is simply what happens when your toys are left alone and the benefits (and downfalls) of being a toy. But what amazes me the most is the emotional connection that it gives to anyone at any age and what keeps it together is the friendship between toys, even though they are only toys, the movie easily grasps the emotions of 2 people turned into best friends. Of course sometime in the future another animated movie will have the same success or more than Toy Story and may even beat it. But Toy Story will always be remembered as the first, and never will be forgotten. Best Toy Story Movie; This movie is funny, hilarious, humorous1 It makes the whole wide world wanna laugh! This movie is so funny, you'd laugh your butt off! I liked it how Sid scared his sister but messing up her toys. I wish I can do what he does to the Animal Crossing players! They make me sick because they suck more than Justin Bieber. Also, it's funny how Woody murdered Buzz! Also Bo Peep reminds me of Princess Peach from the Super Mario series. She should have appeared in the other Toy Story movies. I can't believe they screwed up on Toy Story 3, one of the worst Toy Story movies ever! I hope they don't ever screw up Toy Story 4, which comes out next year. Wonderful animated feature...; TOY STORY is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. It goes along with TOY STORY 2, TARZAN, A BUG'S LIFE, THE LION KING and CHICKEN RUN as some of my favorite animated features. Tom Hank s voices Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll owned by a boy named Andy who is the most-played toy until a space ranger, Buzz (Tim Allen) comes along and Woody is not good friends with them. But one day later, a mean toy-hating man who owns a collection of mutant toys and tries to threaten Buzz, and it is up to Woody to save Buzz with the help of the mutants before it's too late to escape to Andy's new house. The sequel is better than the original, but TOY STORY is a good movie. **** What Makes a Toy a Toy?; Marvellously inventive, brilliantly rendered, perfectly paced, adorably characterized CGI gem with a sinister edge to its witty and intelligent storyline. The voice cast is a pleasure to behold and the toy figures are instantly likable. The alternation between action-packed moments, laugh-out-loud gags and scenes of emotional, downright existential crises offers a deeper viewing experience anyone could've hoped for. Despite two well-made sequels, this one's still the best installment of the much-loved franchise. 8 out of 10 freak toys Another Childhood Favorite!!!; I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since. It has a great storyline. Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, and many more. On Andy's Birthday, he receives a Buzz Lightyear action hero, and Woody becomes jealous because he isn't Andy's favorite anymore. When Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, his friends want nothing to do with him. On the way to Pizza Planet, Buzz confronts him in the family van, and knocks him outside and the family drive off without them. They go through a lot trying to get back to Andy before they move. When they end up in Sid's room, the kid who tortures toys, Woody and Buzz must work together in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TOY STORY!!! A pioneer; You may or may not like \"Toy Story\", but there's something that's perfectly clear: it changed for good the animation cinema. Pixar were pioneers not only in the world of 3D animation but also in offering products that might entertain children and adults. I do prefer movies such as \"Antz\" or \"Shrek\", but I think \"Toy story\" is so funny as well. Anyway, we can't avoid the \"Disney touch\" and all those awful songs... So, after \"Toy story\" came other movies that were much better, but this was the first one and it has a relevant position in the history of cinema. *My rate: 6/10 Really Sweet Movie!; Whether you're a fan of animated Disney movies or not, this movie is brilliant! It's great for family time movies or great for the everyday average Disney fan. The characters are put together very well. After I saw it, it made me actually think about throwing out old toys. I've been a fan of this movie ever since I was born(it was really big then) and I still watch it from time to time. I would definitely recommend this to anybody. Great fun for anyone; Toy Story is definitely a film that a kid should watch before they are a teen. Its adventure and great sense of humour is appealing to adult audiences as well, and the atmosphere is brilliant. This really is a Toy Story. The plot is indeed quite simple, and it would have to be for a classic family. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks)is a toy 'sheriff' doll, owned by a young boy called Andy. Woodys Toy life couldn't as Andy loves him a lot, but as Andy's birthday party arises tension fills the bedroom with each toy living in fear of being replaced. Everything goes well till the last birthday present is opened.. enter Buzz Lightyear! I would be criminal to tell you the rest of the story, but as far as humour and adventure are concerned, this film impresses in both categories. The toys different personalities really contrast and make you laugh, from the smart-chat of Mr. Potatoe head, to Slinky who is Woodys best toy friend. Its so easy to follow this film - the plot and characters are easy to watch the computer graphics are top notch. Compared to modern day CGI kids films, this stands out purely because of its innocence - a simple story, theirs no techno-babble, and its really fun. This truly is the film of the Nineties! The best film for big adults...; It's too bad the first user comment was that this is the best film for small children.  It's not just for kids!  My husband and I were 35 and childless when we first saw this.  We took a chance and purchased it before we saw it. After viewing it for the first time, we immediately watched it again.  It was if we had been on a really fun ride, and had to get back in line again. And fun is the operative word.  What a fun movie.  It's what I look for in a movie - something that takes you away from the cares of the world for a little while and makes you feel good.  Kind of like a drug without adverse after-affects. A catalyst in the field of computer animation; This was the first feature film that was done entirely by computers, and Pixar couldn't have done a better job. Not only is this movie hilarious, touching, and well plotted, but it lead the way for every other computer animated movie, and really set the bar high. If this movie had completely bombed there would no more, or at least not as many, CGI films and we would still be seeing drawn animation. Not to mention that the absolute perfect voice talents were cast to make such a memorable movie for kids and adults and teens and preteens and seniors and new borns or anybody else who eyes and hears or either or. This movie can not me avoided and is a cultural landmark that has opened the door for a completely new genre of movie making. My favorite film as a kid and remains a classic today; As a kid, I remember watching the first two Toy Story films frequently and collecting all the characters from the movie. I found out that it was the very first computer-animated film about two years ago and assumed that's why the movie is still so popular. Woody and Buzz are what made the film what it was then and today and were my favorite characters. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is where Woody and Buzz are launched in the air from the rocket and Buzz frees himself to fly into Andy's toy box. The film remains a classic and always will be to me. I also cannot wait for the third movie to come out June 18, 2010 because I'll be the first in line. Toy Story is the greatest Disney movie ever in my opinion! Looking forward to Toy Story 3 in two years!; There is absolutely no question about it, Disney/Pixar's 1995 hit film, Toy Story, is their absolutely best film in my opinion. Pixar, the visual effects studio based in Northern California, was best known for making short films with three dimensional technology, including some Oscar winning shorts. In 1992 a script called Toy Story was completed and Pixar decided to take on the challenge of creating the world's first fully computer animated motion picture. In 1995, that script came to life, and the rest is history. Not only was Toy Story a gigantic hit for Disney and Pixar, it started series of films that continues to amaze and bewilder children and adults of all ages. The animation was state of the art, and continues to look amazing to this day. The characters, Woody, and Buzz Lightyear, to the humor were all amazing. Pixar won a special Oscar for making the first computer animated film, and it led to many more films of it's type to this day. Pixar, don't make us wait, please give millions of children around the world what we desperately need, more adventures of Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Here's to many more Toy Story films in the future, including the upcoming Toy Story 3 coming in three years, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen returning as Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Why the trailer, why?; I remember seeing all the trailers for this movie and thinking, \"Uggh, how stupid.  Why do they make movies like this?\"  This was when I was in my macho mood.  Ya know, I've outgrown all this animated c%^p.  That was my attitude, so, of course, I avoided this movie for 4 years.  Just last year, Pokemon kinda broke me out of my \"macho mode\" and brought me back to those simple pleasures.  Taught me not to hide the child in me.  So, my mom says we're taking care of my little cousin and wants to know if there's a movie out that we could see.  I mentioned Toy Story 2 (he and I already saw Pokemon, the most underrated movie of '99), but hadn't seen the first one.  So, I drove over to his house to watch Toy Story.  Man, what I was missing.  This is a terrific movie, but not because of the great animation.  The animation is cool, but like I've said, don't be that superficial that you judge the movies completely on animation.  It's the characters that matter, and this one had great characters.  Something that everyone must see. The Best Kids Movie of the 90's; Despite being the first full-length computer-animated movie, the movie's strengths are its plot and characterization.  The technology is not thrust in your face and simply serves to support a truly excellent animated film. A classic. Cool A MUST see; I saw this movie when i was 5 years old a long time ago and I was so obsessed with Buzz Lightyear! I had toys of buzz Lightyear and carried them around anywhere i went.I saw this movie yesterday again and it was fabulous! plain fabulous. The story was amazing and the characters were well made! Nice job Pixar, You done it again! Tom Hanks did well doing a voice of Woody and same with Tim Allen with Buzz. I didn't really like Wall.E i almost fell asleep but this movie kept me awake the whole time with excitement! I recommend this movie to anyone no matter what age you are because this movie Just Beautiful! An fantastic awesome 10/10 very good songs; this has some of my favourite songs ever to be used for an animated film: Strange Things and You've Got a Friend in Need. the songs makes this now dated(!) film more original than Toy Story 2. The animation is fantastic and cutting-edge at the time. Also, it's only 6 years old now, the animation is still as impressive as it was back all those year ago. What else can I say. But this is 1990s equivalent to Snow White and the 7 dwarfs and,indeed, a lot better! Absolutely Love Toy Story!; Toy Story is an incredibly creative, fun film with a touching, heartfelt story. It is an awesome family film. The characters were brilliantly personified as they worked their way through their amazing adventures. The brilliant creativity of the characters and background layout is evident throughout the entire film; the background layout and lighting is fantastic. Each character has it's own vivid personality that was expressed with such unique individualism, additionally each character makes the viewer care for them. The story's continuity is definitely balanced with the awesome visual effects. The movie keeps the viewers' attention throughout it's entirety, with the twists, turns and suspenseful predicaments. The film also lends fun filled moments with many jokes/funny lines and expressions from the characters, while simultaneously allowing the viewers' hearts to reach out to the characters as they are tangled in many of the zany situations they encounter.

It's a very cute movie, mainly for kids, but it has a few chuckles thrown in for adults. The human characters in the movie didn't seem very realistic; their happy-go-lucky, suburban lifestyle just made them very flat and barely likable, especially if you grew up in a family unable to afford multiple toys. The voice actors were delightful, and their moods were directed very well, even for the plastic Army-men who don't show much emotion. The \"cannibal toys\" were very imaginative and creepy, so they served their purpose well. I thought the idea of the claw machine that housed the little green aliens was cute, how \"The Claw\" was their Messiah of sorts. The coloring in the film was vivid and incorporated some awesome day-glow tones that I had forgotten about over time. The ultimate reason to watch the movie is to witness Pixar's astounding use of 3D imagery, especially when they incorporate real-life effects onto the screen (i.e. The magnifying lens over Woody's face). There were some aspects of the film I didn't care for. The movie is only 77 minutes long without the prefaced, short 3D movie before it, making the story suffer and seem a little lacking. I found the music to be over-the-top schmaltzy and generic, but it is primarily for kids and the Disney crowd, so I guess it belongs here. Again, the character of Andy isn't very likable, other than the fact that he owns a lot of older toys that we made have seen commercials of as a kid. The story wasn't very mind-blowing, but from the vantage point of a toy on the run, it is imaginative enough. It's the typical Indiana Jones setting where the main characters always find a way to turn their two-steps forward into one-step back. The ending with the falling through the sunroof was very convenient and could've easily been the start of another obstacle they needed to face, for example. In the end, I like the movie for its presentation, but as a film, I was not blown away with originality or anything by its story. The messages that it sends about jealousy, envy, depression, fear, and questions about one's worthiness to another are the primary focuses throughout the movie, but it ends up just being another nicely tied-up package in the end, which is Disney for you. 5 stars. Created a decade ago, but still stunning; I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago. The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their \"leader\" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other... When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10. very funny; a great movie to watch with your children. this is a movie the whole family will enjoy. we watch this movie over and over. our thirteen year old likes it as much as my three year old, i like it just as much as they do. Tears....; Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library. \"I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films.\"; Toy Story  5/5 stars Children play with toys. It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc\n",
       " But what if toys were real? What if they could talk? Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, 'Toy Story,' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks). Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy's birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one? I'll give you a hint: 'Cheers'). But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid's house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy's house safely. 'Toy Story' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in 'Toy Story,' filling our minds with endless possibilities. What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn't just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar managed to preach to us 'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film 'Toy Story.' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real? What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities? An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you've got yourself one of the best films ever. Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll's expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good. The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy). The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing. I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had. Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made  something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.' 'Toy Story' 1 & 2 are both on my 'favorite films' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would 'Monsters Inc.' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar's upcoming film 'Finding Nemo,' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films  not sequels  by 2005), they should definitely try to make a 'Toy Story 3.' I'll be first in line for it, anyway. Cute Family Movie; Toy Story is a great movie for children and adults. Children will enjoy it simply because it is a cartoon. They will find it exciting because it shows toys coming to life which is something every child pretends with their toys. It's a good movie for children because it teaches them about jealousy, friendship, and teamwork. Adults will appreciate the animation and the accuracy of the details in the toys. Most of the toys used in this film were ones most people had as children. Such as, Mr. Potato head, the slinky dog, etch-a-sketch, and the army men. The theme of Toy Story is friendship. The movies theme song was titled \"You've Got a Friend in Me\". The friendship in this movie is about overlooking insecurities and finding a true friend in someone that you think would be your biggest enemy. A 2001 movie called Monsters Inc. is directed around this same theme. A little girl named Boo should be afraid of the monsters as much as the monsters are afraid of her but they form a friendship that overcomes their differences. Toy Story is about the lives of toys owned by a boy named Andy. Andy is having a birthday and he gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear. Andy's toys worry about him getting new toys because they are afraid they will get lost or donated. With the arrival of Buzz, Woody fills that Andy will like Buzz better. He tries to lose Buzz but instead he accidentally knocks him out of a window. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were brilliantly matched for being the voices of Woody and Buzz Lightyear. The personalities of the actors and characters seemed to be a perfect fit. The other toys in the movie, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky dog (Jim Varney), Pig named Ham(John Ratzenberger), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), and Bo Peep(Annie Potts), feel like Woody did this on purpose because he was jealous of the attention Buzz was getting from Andy. In order to make things right Woody realizes he needs to get Buzz back. Woody and Buzz both wind up separated from Andy and this is where their adventure begins. From this point on they work together to get back to Andy's before his family moves. Along the way Buzz realizes that he is not a space ranger but a toy. Woody tries to help Buzz understand that he is not just a toy and that he is very important to children. Woody convinces Buzz that they must get back to Andy. At the conclusion of the movie, Buzz and Woody are helping each other make it on the moving truck. They finally make it next to Andy who is excited to see both of them. Toy Story is about the friendship that is formed between Woody and Buzz. Once Woody was able to get passed his insecurities he realized that Andy could have two favorite toys. The motif of friendship is displayed throughout the movie by the relationships between Woody and Andy, Woody and all the other toys, and between Woody and Buzz. They also form a friendship with the strange toys at Sid's house. This movie is a true example of friendship. A Monumental Achievement in the Cinema; \"Toy Story\" is a real sight to behold because it is the first feature-length, computer-animated film.  Once you get passed the amazing visual effects, you see a really great film that works because of interesting characters and a second-to-none screenplay.  Even the roughest of critics would have trouble finding problems with this winner.  5 stars out of 5. Revolutionary. A fierce work of genius.; I don't necessarily like G-rated movies, but I make this one an exception. This movie is just great (it was the biggest moneymaker of 1995, and rightly so). I think that \"Toy Story\" appeals to kids and adults alike 'cause it's so funny, fast, and exhilarating. No one had done anything like this before; it was such a huge earthquake in the movie industry. It was also the world's first completely CG-animated movie. I can especially identify with Rex 'cause we're both nervous at times (except it's not from an inferiority complex), and we both like video games. This is easily one of my most favorite movies. \"An instant classic for all ages\". Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie; I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about. Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys. The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys. Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film. What a movie; Wow, I remember back in 1995 when I first saw this movie back in 1995. I think it was the movie being the farthest away that I could remember in theaters, and I saw it like two or three times. At first, I thought it was something about these toys trying to get to another group of toys, and they were a big group themselves. I couldn't believe how amazing the plot was. After I saw that movie it was like I couldn't get enough of Toy Story stuff. The characters were cool as well, and they just all seemed to be in the right places at the right time, like Mr. Potato Head, especially. And I had waited for years for a Toy Story 2 to come out, and after four years of waiting, it finally happened! And it was an excellent sequel! The extra fun in this movie, spotting the other toys that make cameos. It was kind of a simple plot that just worked, what with the rivalry between Woody and Buzz competing for Andy's favorite toy and the wisecracks of that pig, and Rex. I even got my own TS toys and such. It was truly a memorable movie. 10/10. Nice work, Disney and Pixar! Classic Pixar! This is what future Pixar films should be like!; Remember the original Pixar movies? Remember when Pixar didn't have stereotypical surfers and rappers? It was when the characters were fun and familiar. They didn't waste out time with farting jokes, but instead had smart jokes that weren't overdone. (even if they were more geared towards adults.) Luckily, we still have one good, classic Pixar movie; Toy Story. Peter Doctor knows how to make a fun and enjoyable family movie. Woody, is the \"top toy\" of Andy's bedroom. He leads meeting and events, and is one of the most popular toys there. But, then, Andy has a birthday party. Everybody is worried about getting replaced by a toy, but Woody assures them that there is nothing to be worried about. Funny, how he ends up getting replaced by Buzz Lightyear-the new popular toy. Ironic, huh? So, he gets jealous and tries to kill Buzz, by setting up a trap and pushing him out the window. Then, the other toys find out, and think \"Let's kill Woody!\" Wow, the irony in it all! The only way the toys will forgive him, is if he brings Buzz back. So, Woody and Buzz meet up at \"Pizza Palace.\" After exploring a bit, they get caught by Sid-the sick and twisted kid next door. But, what makes this movie so good? Toy Story isn't your average kids' film. It seems to have a message in it all. Two unlikely friends, Buzz and Woody hate each other at first. Then, they slowly learn trust each other, and stick together through thick and thin. Toy Story is perhaps one of those \"feel good\" movies. It's fun, and doesn't try to be anything it's not. Toy Story is an enjoyable, fun, and all-around excellent film. Be sure to put it on your \"To Watch\" list. 10/10 1995: Oh my God, is this real? 2016: Oh my God, what am I looking at?; Toy Story, as the first completely CGI animated movie, is still timeless in plenty of ways and is enjoyed by anyone who can say they like animation. I am one of them. The animation is of course crude by today's standards, but it was made in a way that makes it seem like 1995 wasn't that long ago. As dated as it looks, we can still appreciate it for being more than just a test of what computers could render. As for complaints, the jokes could have been funnier and the story could have less instances of convenience, like how Buzz and Woody enter the Pizza Planet Truck and come across a nice, high pile of pizza boxes to hide behind. There were also some errors in the anatomy of some toys, like RC. I won't take points off for the animation because hey, it was 1995 and Pixar had up to that point only been making shorts for 11 years, so it isn't something to grouch over (even though there were some superficial glitches like disappearing lights between scenes). All I can say is, see it soon and brace for a higher intrigue of the early history of CGI. Instant Classic; Every company has that one movie that puts them on the map. That is what Toy Story did for Pixar. Toy Story is a cartoon about a little boy's toy collection that is alive when the little boy is not around. His name is Andy and he loves his toys, and they love him back. Woody is a cowboy and is Andy's favorite toy. The toys always get worried every Christmas and birthday because they fear they will be replaced by a bigger and better toy. The story starts off with Andy's birthday party and all of the toys are on edge. It turns out that a new toy by the name of Buzz Lightyear challenges Woody as the favorite toy. Buzz comes along, steals a little bit of the spotlight and Woody gets incredibly jealous. Eventually Woody and Buzz get lost and must find their way home and back to Andy before he and his family move away forever. Let's start with the toys. I loved these toys. Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Little Bow Peep, Woody, Buzz, Slink, Ham, and even Etch-a-Sketch are the main toys and each are lovable and different. Rex is hilarious because he is ironic. He is a dinosaur but he is a wimp, and he is my favorite of the toys. I remember watching as a little kid and I was always excited to see Rex on screen. Each character has their individual role. There are also toys every kid can relate with and that make the movie special. For example, the barrel of monkeys, the small soldiers, the etch-a-sketch, and Mr. Potato Head are toys every kid used to play with. The smaller toys aren't really relevant for long but when they are seen in the beginning and end of the movie their impact is huge. One of the major themes in the story is jealousy and the relationship between Woody and Buzz. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the favorite toy. Woody is a cowboy with a pull string that says some catch phrases. The other toys look up to him, he is a hero, and Andy loved him with all his heart. Andy dresses up like a cowboy, has Woody posters, and is obsessed with this toy. Woody embraces the love; it defines him, gives him confidence, and confirms that he is the leader. Then Buzz Lightyear comes into the picture with his better quality of a toy. He doesn't have a pull string, but a button Andy presses to have a better sound quality voice box will speak catch phrases. He is made of plastic, which is more durable and he has wings pop out which can simulate flight. Woody becomes incredibly jealous of Buzz and fights for Andy's love. He eventually knocks him out the window. Toy Story may be a kid's movie but it has an interesting and entertaining premise, especially with its characterization. Woody and Buzz both develop into better and stronger characters. Woody goes from a pompous, jealous, selfish, toy, into a respectable and lovable character. He and Buzz become best friends and inseparable, a little cliché, but it's a movie for families so it's perfect. When Buzz first appeared he thought he was a real \"space ranger.\" He was convinced that he was not a toy, he could really fly, and he had a dangerous \"laser\" which was really a blinking light bulb. He develops and he eventually accepts the fact that he is a toy but he is a \"cool toy.\" He is \"Andy's toy.\" Woody admits his jealousy to Buzz and that becomes a turning point in their relationship. We have our villain in the movie, Sid. This kid is just evil. He is a spoiled kid who \"terrorizes toys, just for fun.\" One scene we the toys in Andy's room watch him as he straps firecrackers to a Commander Carl and it explodes. First of all, what kind of nine or ten year old kid plays with explosives? If he isn't nine or ten, what is he doing playing with kid toys? He may tear them apart and put different parts on them, making them scary and horrific for children to even see on screen, that just doesn't make sense. His character fits for a children's movie but in reality a kid like this would never exist in real life. Sid is really my only problem with the movie, but still a character needed for the film. Overall, Toy Story is a classic and put Pixar on the map and was the beginning of a highly successful company. It came out in the 1995 and families everywhere fell in love, including me. It is a movie that can be watched again and again no matter what age. It is a movie kids will show their children when they are older. Teenagers lined up to see Toy Story 3 years later because it meant so much to them back when they were little. Toy Story and its characters left a rare imprint on the hearts of people all over the world. Without a doubt, Toy Story gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and goes down as one of my personal all time favorite animation movies. Review; Disney and Pixar team up to create Disney's first full-length computer animated cinematic masterpiece, Toy story. Made in 1995, Toy Story was a marking point in movie history not only for its computer animation, but also having a timeless story full of witty characters and adventures. Toy Story is set in a suburban like neighborhood following an ensemble group of toys. Toys have human like abilities and personalities, but are forced to hide them from their human companions for the sake of being a toy. The main group of toys include a cowboy action figure, a piggy bank, a plastic dinosaur, a Mr. Potato Head as well as many more, all of whom live under their owner, Andy. The movie opens with Andy's birthday, which means receiving new toys to accompany old ones. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, is Andy's favorite action figure and also the group's leader. Woody and his fellow toy friends are somewhat threatened but also enthralled by this event. After a short time of announcing what Andy received, the toys are relieved to find that Andy did not receive any new toys. They were in for a surprise. Little did they know that there was a surprise toy on Andy's bed. It was the newest and coolest toy on the market, Buzz Light-year, a space orientated action figure voiced by Tim Allen who turns out to be Andy's next favorite toy. The strange thing about Buzz is that he believes that he is an actual space alien fighter. The toys try to convince Buzz that he is a mere toy only to be favored by Andy. Since Buzz believes he is actually a space fighter this leads into leaving the house and begin his journey to outer space. This ultimately pursues Woody to go and save his rival while getting tied up in a wacky adventure. There is a reason why this film acquired nineteen awards and ten nominations. Both adults and children will be entertained with the concept of living toys. The plot of the movie is really where it shines. There isn't one point in Toy Story where the plot gets boring or dragged out. People at Disney's Pixar developed the characters so well that it makes you understand how characters behave. Also, with a movie with so many diverse characters the audience is bound to find someone relate to. The only downside about seeing this movie is its length. It is around eighty minutes but it seems like the movie is about two hours, but that doesn't mean it isn't a full price movie because it is absolutely worth your time. Toy Story is definitely recommended to all families and especially kids. As for everyone else as an audience, I would recommend the movie if you would like to revisit your child hood or if you just want to see a beautifully animated movie. Whoever the audience may be, Toy Story will put a smile on your face. Toy Story is a classic beyond all means. It has stunning visuals, a crazy plot, deep character development, and most importantly it brings people back to a time when nothing mattered except toys. The most inspiring aspect of the movie is the moral of friendship. It really teaches people that they can't get anywhere in life without companionship. Toy Story also really captured the thought of \"what if toys were alive\" and executed it in a witty way. This movie will definitely be playing on family TV screens till \"Infinity and Beyond\"! Great fun for everyone; I just watched this movie for the first time since I was 12 (I'm 24 now). A lot of times when I view films I liked as a child, my perspective as an adult changes, by either noticing how little effort was put into certain films, or just that storyline/quality isn't there. Toy Story does not do this. As the first fully CG film, the detail I must say is fantastic and quite smooth. There is subtle adult humor in there that no child will be able to pick up, which makes this a great family flick, since both adults and children can enjoy it. The plot is original and quite interesting. And too anybody who ever lost a \"Toy\" as a child, sometimes you may wonder, if they got up on their own and walked away. It's sad that now and days, family films/kids films don't focus as much on story and dilogue like they used too and things just become a jumbled mess or completely juvenile. This film has quality story, dilogue and voice acting. And unlike a lot of other Disney movies which portray violence and some direct indendendo, this takes a lighter comedic side and it's a refreshing change from some films prior to it and even things made till this day. With that it also displays human emotions (Exaggerated of course for what they toys are feeling) But none the less, displays the essence of feeling replaced, or trying to be something you want to be,without having the means to do so. I highly reccemmend this to anybody who hasn't seen it yet. If you're and adult, don't be turned off by the CG animation. It's not by any means like a cartoon. The best film for small children....; My toddler has been watching this film for about 3 months, and I'm not sick of it and neither is she. It doesn't scare her, and it's teaching her about imagination, friendship, and kindness. All the performances are top notch, and the script is phenomenal. Any movie that has \"Wind the Frog!\" as a line , has to be a classic. The virtual world that has been created is remarkable in itself, but is equally partnered with a wonderful script. The song's compliment and impart in-depth character and plot points and Woody's personal journey is a lesson for all. I never really thought this was the best movie...; Toy Story is a good movie. It has good characters and a decent story. But is it really worth the hype? Yes, it's the first fully computer animated movie ever made and that's very impressive. For that reason alone, it will stand out in history. But I certainly never really thought it was the brilliant classic everyone else thought it was. Its animation is great but the story suffers from major pacing issues. There are entire moments of the movie right in the middle that bore me every time and don't stop boring me until I get to the film's climax, when it picks up again. A lot of trimming should have been done in the middle. Toy Story is good but its sequels are a lot better. So is it bad? No. But it's not brilliant. If this were 2-D, I doubt it would receive this high praise. Best Pixar movie to date!; Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (\"I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout\"). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox. this movie is awesome!the humor never bores!; i remember when this movie came out in 1995. i was seven at the time. i have loved it since day 1. actors such as tom hanks and tim allen bring sparkle to the show. they are both hillarious as woody and buzz. this movie is directed at both kids and adults. the humor never goes flat and it is never cheesy or corny. if you are a fan of tom hanks and tim allen or you just want a good laugh, than you shoud definitely watch this movie. you will not regret it. ********** out of **********. Loved It 10 Stars! Great Disney Movie!; Im 14 Years Old And I Saw Toy Story When I Was 10 Years Old I Loved It And I Still Do Today! Toy Story Is About Buzz And Woody And The Rest Of The Toy Gang Trying To Save Buzz From The Evil Sid! Very Good Movie! With The Voices Of Tim Allan (Home Inprovment) Tom Hanks (Forest Gump) And Don Rickles (Classc Tv Star) And Jim Varney (Ernest) -Jeremy One of the very best animation movies; TOY STORY stands on totally own feet! Having the sequel released after this, the TOY STORY became quickly a high status animation movie. In this first movie we get to know Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Potato Head and all the others, and I tell you; it's so jolly good entertainment! Seeing things from a toys perspective, is really fascinating and really cool, having stairs as a huge mountain and a aggressive dog is the Devil itself! TOY STORY starts off very wity, and although the movie gets darker and more exciting, it always has this extremely charming and wity undertone. I laughed jolly loud, and it is such a pro made movie that it's already a classic. STARS; 5/5 I seen a movie quite like this one; I saw this movie was I was about 10 years old and I was captivated. This film was awesome. I watch it over and over again with my younger siblings and I enjoy it just as much as them. It's a great story and every time I watch it, it brings out the the kid in me. Tom Hanks was amazing as Woody. Tom Hanks is one of my heroes and he never seizes to amaze me. He really brings Woody to life and he fits the role perfectly. Toy Story has a really good, solid story line and amazing visuals, especially for 1995. Toy Story 2 was almost as amazing as this movie, but nothing's as good as the original. I heard that they're making a Toy Story 3 set to be released in 2008. I'm hoping the theater is packed, with different generations, appreciating how Toy Story is not a only a stunning film, but also an example of the best kind of art there is. An absolutely awesome motion picture. 100/10 Exciting; Toy story is a 1995 American computer-animated adventure buddy comedy film produced by Pixar Animetion Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures, directed by John Lasseter at his directorial debut. Toy story was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first theatrical film produced by Pixar. In the film, toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present. A group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy, are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother and his sister are preparing to move the following week. The toy's leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Woody organized the other toys. Andy gets an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear as a birthday present. He believes that he is an actual space ranger. What happen to Andy's toys next? The characters have individuality. The picture on the screen is colorful, so I think the film is very cute. I am excited because I think about what happen next and what Andy's toy do next. I love the film's view of the world. Everyone enjoys the film, regardless of age or sex. I want you to watch the film. Pixar's first full length movie.; This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back 10 years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies. Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only 7 when I first watched it in theaters). The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like \"Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc.\" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him. Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a \"Buzz Lightyear\" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys. Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more. I give it an 8/10 perfect movie for the whole family to watch. Four Dimensional Toybox; I see that my previous comment on this film was deleted. This is the thing that started it all: Pixar. Somewhat photorealistic modeling. Deep, deep attention to story dynamics. An animated feature not so polished since \"Snow White.\" Something worthy. Something that led to the reinvention of Disney. Its an iconic turning point, like \"Citizen Kane,\" \"2001,\" \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" Greenaway's \"Tempest.\" (and others) Many things after change. So it should be seen on its historical basis alone. Here already you can see that Pixar decides to combine goals. They want the movie to be just as good as the best non- animated movie. There is the well-documented attention to refining and refining the story dynamics so that the narrative spine simply works. That took years. What I mean by combined goals is that they also realized that they were presenting something relatively new in their three D modeling capability. So they wanted to have that new cinematic vocabulary enhance the narrative dynamics and vice versa. It is subtle here, not fully developed until \"Nemo.\" But its plain to see when pointed out: the camera simply moves in ways that a real one does not. There are a broader set of intimate and distanced observer perspectives. These are not overused, lest you notice them, but you can see that out tolerance and viewing skill has slowly evolved from this to the later Pixar projects. (At this writing, that is \"Wall-E.\") The business about family and desired roles are not \"the point\" as some would say, but strategies to explore this deeper narrative power. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching. Great Animation, Great Characters; This movie probably was the best kids' movie I've ever seen in my life. Its animation was superb and Tim Allen was very funny as the voice of Buzz Lightyear, an action figure who really thinks he is the space hero he's supposed to be. The rest of the characters also had great things to say. \"That's not flying, that's falling with style!\" was an unforgettable line. It was a great movie.; This was, and still is, a great movie. It was amazing how the toys sort of live a double life, behaving like humans when no one's looking. I loved how all the toys are like a big family, with Woody being like a leader. As for Buzz Lightyear, I thought he was going to be really tall, but it turns out, he's shorter than he appeared. It was hilarious how Buzz believed he was a \"space ranger\". Also, Woody and Buzz sort of reminded me of Tawni and Sonny from the show Sonny With a Chance when they first met. Both Buzz and Sonny were \"the new kid\" who got accepted by almost everyone, and both Woody and Tawni were the only one who didn't accept the \"new kid\" and got jealous (but eventually learned to accept the \"new kid\"). So now, when I watch this movie, I think of the first episode of Sonny With a Chance. Best of the pixar movies; I am a big fan of all of Pixars movies and have seen all of them at the cinema, however for me this stands head and shoulders above the rest (including this years brilliant WallE). I watched it again recently and despite my age was pissing myself with laughter. This is mainly down to the characters who are so fresh. The banter between woody and Buzz is terrific (\"YOU ARE A TOY!!!\") and the other characters are also brilliant, especially ,for me, the bitter, angry and cynical Mr potato head , who lends a slightly darker more adult edge to this film compared to the Pixar movies to come ,as well as Sid his dog and the mutilated toys he has created. It is after all the only pixar movie rated parental guidance, i think which lets the emotions of the characters be more human in the shape of jealousy, pride and competitiveness. The central ideas of toys being alive when you cant see them is probably their best idea to date just in sheer amount of imagination and the amount of opportunity and possibility it creates (their is after all a sequel) and does kind of become a template for later. This definitely provided a lifeline for Disney who had seriously passed its golden age, and were starting to lose their reputation of quality and connection with its younger and older audience. With Lasseter moving to head of creative output at Disney, hopefully he will put them back on track also. (By the way I noticed a lack of any fathers in it, I don't know if thats meant to be read into) Fantastically Enjoyable Classic; Toy Story is about an old cowboy doll's jealousy toward a new spaceman toy, and the trouble it gets them into. The movie is a joy to watch, with a witty script jam-packed with hilarious gags and funny lines, wrapped up in an engaging, adventure-type plot. It's filled with appealing characters, voiced by an extraordinary cast. Tom Hanks as the cowboy and Tim Allen as the spaceman fit their roles perfectly, backed up by the amusing support of R. Lee Ermy, Jim Varney, and John Ratzenberger. The story does rely too much on coincidences (getting picked up by the next-door neighbor) and stereotypes (surfer-talking, reckless teenage pizza delivery guy), though. Contains: A Mild Comic Fight, Some Scary Images Toys come to life in this entertaining computer-animated film from Pixar...; It's only now, fifteen years after its release, that I decided to give TOY STORY a look on my large flat screen TV. I've never been a fan of computer animation per se, but this charming story has heart and wit and enough entertainment value for both young and old. The toy characters are both appealing and very funny in ways that anyone can appreciate, thanks to a clever script. Woody the Cowboy and Buzz Lightyear compete for the affections of a small boy, Andy, whose playroom is loaded with toys that come alive whenever anyone leaves the bedroom. Out of this fresh idea, the plot bounces along with supreme confidence as it races forward putting all of them in constant danger from their ever changing environment, especially when they leave the confines of Andy's home. Technically, the film is a marvel--everything simulated through computer wizardry, all of it invented with taste for artistry evident in every frame of the film--the kind of artistry that the Walt Disney studio demonstrated during the heyday of their cartoon wizardry. The brilliant colors look even more amazing in the good print of the film that aired on cable tonight. Well worth watching for pure family entertainment, a rarity nowadays. Pixar First Feature is an Instant Classic; Pixar's long line of success began in 1993 with TOY STORY, the first in a series of highly successful CG family films. Pixar had the formula nailed from the start, creating a fun kid's film with a powerful story capable of entertaining adults. In the film, we're introduced to the world of Andy's room when no one's around and the toys come to life. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is a classic cowboy doll complete with a pull-string vocal box and reigns as young Andy's favorite toy. For his birthday, Andy receives a flashy new Buzz Lightyear action figure (voiced by Tim Allen) and Woody must cope with the fact that he may have been bumped from the top position. A botched attempt at lodging Buzz behind Andy's desk throws Buzz out into the real world and Woody must bring him back to regain the trust of the other toys. The fun of this kid's film lies in the characters. Allen is hilarious as Buzz and his inability to grasp that he's merely a child's toy and not an actual space ranger, spending half the film trying to return to Star Command; Hanks is a bit neurotic and totally high strung as Woody in his role as the toy-in-charge (going so far as to hold meetings on plastic erosion and establishing a buddy-system for moving day). The room is loaded with great supporting characters in the form of classic playthings from everyone's childhoods: a Slinky dog, a Mr. Potato Head, a piggy bank\n",
       "each with their own unique personalities. These characters are each fun enough to deserve their own movie and we're lucky to have been given the TOY STORY sequels to return to this world. I really enjoy the film overall (as do just about everyone I know who's seen it) and there is little to complain about. It's amazing to see how well the animation stands up after so many years. You can see that the computer graphics aren't as smooth as modern CG, but it's still near seamless. Pixar's first film is a classic I was happy to introduce to my daughter. Cynical and disturbing; This is one film that left me with a very sour aftertaste.  Yes, it's animated with character and vigour, and there are some fine -- if over the top -- voice performances.  However, there are some very disturbing aspects to the film.  The first is that it's like nothing so much as watching a 90 minute advert.  Even if merchandising hadn't been released to support the film, all the supporting cast could already by bought in your local toy shop.  I'm sure I wasn't the only viewer who found this more than a little suspect. Possible spoiler: The second, perhaps larger, point against the film lies in the characterisation of the two boys, Andy and Sid.  Andy is the \"good\" boy. He plays safely and passively with his toys, they don't do anything toys wouldn't do.  Sid, the \"bad\" boy is more creative.  He adapts toys to fit his own vision, he's an innovator, a creator.  It's this very creativity of his that is portrayed as a bad thing.  Sid isn't the ideal target audience for this film: he wouldn't be satisfied with row after row of identical shop-bought toys, he would much rather make his own.  I guess this review is being written for all the Sids out there, who are demonised and vilified by this ultra-corporate nightmare of a film. Wonderful Film One of Pixar's Best; I love animated Disney films, although I must say I usually prefer the original classic hand drawn Disney films, at some point we have to accept change, and what better way to accept this change with a wonderful superb film. (I mean common they booked Toy Story 4 already). Toy's come to life when their owner is asleep, and its all about the battle for who is the best and most popular toy. Whenever Christmas or the little boy's birthday come around the toys get nervous that they will be abandoned or replaced. When a new toy arrives they are determined to hate him and ignore him, but they end up becoming friends. It was a privilege witnessing this film-making achievement.; Pixar started with a big bang: Toy Story. I loved this film as a kid and all the more as an adult. Every moment in this film is memorable, great or small. Don't tell me you don't remember parts like Andy's playtime with Mr. Potatohead as the villain, that mosquito on Buzz's visor, Pizza Planet, or at least one of the twisted toys. The way the story is put together is simple yet clever. The characters are lovable and are all equally important to the story. I may not have realized back then that I was seeing the first cgi animated feature film but I am somewhat glad I didn't know about that. Having to enjoy the film sincerely is way better than that. It's still a privilege seeing this on it's original date. The Largest Part Of My Childhood Put On Screen.; With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. \"Toy Story\" was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises & confidence. How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history. I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling & technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals & entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks & Tim Allen, and almost immediately think \"Toy Story\". As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then. Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, \"Toy Story\" is that proof. 10/10. Great Fun For Kids And Adults Alike; Toy Story is one of those rare animated movies, designed for children, that adults can enjoy. Plot In A Paragraph: Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) is 8 year old Andy's favourite toy, however his world falls apart when Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) figure for his birthday and he has to play second fiddle to the new space ranger. I loved this movie. Over the years I have watched it with both my kids and nieces and nephews and they have all enjoyed it. Watching it now, it has lost none of its charm. Tom Hanks is superb as Woody, Tim Allen (who I'm not a fan of) is delightful as the deluded Buzz Lightyear who is not aware he is an action figure, but for me the stand out voice was John Ratzenberger as Pork Chop the Piggy Bank. simply a timeless classic; this movie is one of the best, if not the best animated movie i have ever seen. i have seen this feel so many times, and yet every time i see it is has the same magic as when i first saw it. i would strongly recommend this film to anyone that has a shred of taste. suitable for adults and children alike. there is nothing this film doesn't have. hilarious and sweet. the voice actors finish this movie off, and it will stay on your mind for a very long time. i have seen all of the pixar movies i can think of, and by far this stands out as the best. how anyone doesn't like this movie i don't know. such a simple story, that we all dreamt up when we were young, is captured in an incredible fashion. this movie simply would not work as well if it was normal cartoon. followed up by an equally good movie, it is easy to say that you will never see another movie that captures your childhood as well as this does the plot is simple, and never feels to simple or complicated. there is never a second where there is confusion, or there is not something that the audience will like. attention is captured and maintained. Technically impressive with great script and sharp wit; Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence. Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula. The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads. Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors.  Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz.  Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults. Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things! 4th best film of all time!; This is the first movie I ever saw. I grew up with this film and loved ever since I was little. A few movies surpass it, but every other film iv'e ever seen is inferior. This is one of the big ones. It takes a lot to live up to this film. Its one of the most popular films, if not the most popular film of all time! Tom Hanks and Tim Allen head the lead voice cast. A cowboy doll named Woody, whose been the favorite of his owner, Andy since he first got him, is in for it when he's replaced by the latest and hottest new toy, Buzz Lightyear, (Tim Allen). A few accidents here and there get them stranded in the middle of nowhere, causing them to team up to get back home. If the story isn't enough to pull you in, (which it should be anyway) then the beautiful animation, the brilliant voices, and the funny jokes will be more than enough. Of course, iv'e seen the movie so many times, I know about each scene and each fact of the movie by heart. Even after all these times watching it, I still manage to laugh at it a little. Everybody whose anybody has seen, or at least heard of this film. I don't know a single person who hasn't seen this. All I can say left is that its one of the greatest and touching films of all time. Except for a few other films, nothing passes this film! An Instant Classic!; After a few short films and no major recognition-in 1991, Pixar set out to start the ball rolling for computer-animated entertainment and in 1995 unleashed not just a mere film but a work of art. An instant classic when first released...Toy Story went on to earn nearly $400 million worldwide and capture the hearts of children and adults alike with its unforgettable characters, magical musical score, hilarious script and the classic quote \"To infinity and beyond\". Woody (Tom Hanks) is an old-fashioned pull - string cowboy doll living a life of luxury as the favourite toy of a young boy named Andy. Surrounded by a colourful cast of characters - such as the cynical Mr. Potato Head, the wisecracking Piggy bank Hamm and Woody's brown-nosing second-in-command Slinky Dog - Woody seems something of a king. However, when a new toy arrives on the scene-a high tech spaceman action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Woody suddenly loses his popularity. But this toy comes with a surreal extra feature - he thinks he's the real Buzz Lightyear!! In the effort of removing Buzz as Andy's favourite toy-both toys are swept out of their home, and into the outside world where they unite reluctantly in friendship for an adventure home. The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in 1937 lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Pixar begins; I recently went to see the double feature which included \"Toy Story\" and \"Toy Story 2\" and I don't know if it's the nostalgia kicking in but it was still quite fun. I mean it wasn't good as when I first saw it when it came out when I was in elementary school, but it was still pretty entertaining and brought back some memories. The animation was amazing, and phenomenal when it first came out and still holds up today. The voice actors even did a great job, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did a great job with there performance in portraying Woody and Buzz Lightyear. It was a exciting adventure, although the plot was simple it was effective and entertaining.The story is about toys coming to life, but keeping themselves secret by acting like they aren't alive. But the toys coexist with humans peacefully, except the toys in Andy's room get worried on birthdays and Christmases of being replaced. Thus when Andy's favorite toy get replaced by a new favorite toy, the conflict starts from there when the older toy that was Andy's favorite tries to hide the new toy, but ends up hitting it out the window. Although this day and age, kid's who are about Andy' age probably won't play with the types of toys portrayed in the movie, and the magic was sort of lost from when I saw it when I was in elementary. This movie is still ahead of it's time, by a large margin. 8.5/10 An amazing family film; Toy Story is a timeless classic. Probably the most genuine, innocent, simplistic yet powerful attempt to create a children film which appeals both adults and kids alike. It is the story of how two rival 'living' toys - a old western cowboy toy (Woody) and action figure of a space commander (Buzz Lightyear) become best friends under some dangerous circumstances. There are bunch of numerals toys like Mr. Potato, a Barbie, a magnifying toy, a truck, alien toys and many more. The film is crafted so well that within some few minutes of the film, you are intrigued to it. It is a fascinating film, with amazing characterization. The toys are so believable that you feel close to them. You feel cherished when Allan and his company make a spoiled brat kid Sid (who loves blowing up toys) realize how important is to save toys which bring back the memories of childhood. I must say the script is effortless and very well written. Music by Randy Newman is also great. One striking thing in this film are its sound effects and CGI which are considered ground-breaking for a 1995 film. Overall, the film is highly recommended. Not only for children, but for everyone who love cherishing the childhood memories - the lovely Toys. fantastic; Toy Story i think is a fantastic animated movie to watch. This movie was rated as a PG (Parental Guildence) This movie was made in 1995. This is fantastic to watch, i got to tell ya. It is an amazing animated movie. I give this movie 10 out of 10. As Good as It Gets!; What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It's a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can't really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the \"humanity\" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute. The movie that changed all animations that were to come; Even though there were other animation classics such as Lion King, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, no other animation movie, prior to this, had being a 3D Computer Animated Film making this one of the most ground-breaking films of all time. This movie is also unique in every sense. Even though the movie is targeted for children and is the movie that every single child watches during their child hood, its so good that even adults absolutely love it. The film follows the tale of Andy's toys who are, unknown to all humans, actually alive. During the movie, as Buzz, Andy's new toy comes, Sheriff Woody becomes jealous of Buzz as he becomes Andy's new favorite and attempts to put an end to it but Buzz gets his revenge. However, the two get captured by Sid, the evil kid next door that enjoys torturing toys and must try their best to escape. To be fair, this movie is one of the shortest films I've ever seen but also one of the most enjoyable. The voice acting for the film is just masterful. Tom Hanks voice acting of Woody is just brilliant and Tim Allen as Buzz was brilliant. The voice acting just added further strength to every aspect of the film. The animations for a 1995 film, being the first 3D animated film, is just visually amazing! Though it may not stand out against recent visual animations, this movie is just a joy to watch, even after 18 years! One thing that is incredibly cool is that they don't explain how exactly the toys ever were alive and its great to see such thing left anonymous. I also found the characters extremely entertaining and the way that Buzz and Woody become friends during the film is just well made! Also, having your main characters toys and in fact making a movie entirely based on toys can be some pain and something which people just laugh at but in this film, we as an audience are emotionally connected to these plastic toys! Its because, despite being toys, the director portrays these as human like things which makes it extremely interesting to us. The dialogue in the film is great and as a result it constantly made me laugh. I loved that little kid as a villain. I thought he was fascinating and I'm glad that very little time is spent about Andy. Despite being made for children all adults are sure to have a blast with this film. In fact, I don't see why nobody has yet to see this film. In case you haven't, be sure to remember that this film changed all animation films to come and that this is surely one of Pixar's ever most finest films! Simply, the best animated film of them all.; Disney used to be good, wholesome family entertainment that was not only clean but fun. Now, most everything they put out is outdated postmodern trash that portrays all children as geniuses able to rule the world and all parents as evil minions trying to keep their children from having fun. Thank God for Pixar coming to existence. Starting with Toy Story in 1995, they made a great family film that appeals to adult humor as well as children. They haven't failed since. They can do no wrong it seems, and I pray it continues that way. Of all their great films, this is undoubtedly in my mind the best of them all. It is also arguably better than any animated film Disney ever did, including the classics of the 1940s and 50s. The premise is so clever and daring in that it could go wrong in so many ways. It never does, though, and in a mere 82 minutes, it covers more information than many other 2 hour films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have become iconic in their roles as Woody and Buzz. The animation and dialogue is so good it is as if they are really on screen arguing with one another. The supporting characters are also very good and funny. With animation, perhaps the most important aspect is the voice characters. Pixar has done a great job of not always going with a star to do the voices, but rather simply going with the one that fits the character best. Overall, Toy Story is superb film-making with a great script, wonderful voices and animation that still impresses despite all the technological improvements. Thank you, Pixar. I am truly grateful to you for saving animated films. one of the best movies of 1995; toy story is another successful Disney 90s flick of the 90s followed by A goofy movie The lion king and inspector gadget 1 and the other 90s Disney movies this one is so outstanding its about toys that come to life when their owner is not looking and are feared about getting replaced if you can remember Johnson and friends the kids TV series where toys come to life and feared that they are going to be replace but that has nothing to do with this very successful movie I love this movie to bits its good fun and great for kids and adults too if you have toys in your room you night think they are alive trust me you can think of it so if you love Disney movies like A goofy movie Herbie the love bug The lion king or other very successful Disney movies from the 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s or the early 2000s then you will love this one its great to have for your Disney DVD or VHS sets. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 because people really love it. Brilliant, Simply Brilliant Film; Sometimes, just Sometimes, A Disney film is released and is made into a classic. Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, Bambi are just a few of the classics. But My all time fave Disney films are the ones made by Pixar. Toy Story, is my third favourite Disney Film. The story revolves around a toy cowboy called Woody (Tom Hanks, who does an excellent job)who is owned by Andy, a 4 year old boy. On Andy's birthday, he recieves a Buzz Lightyear action figure (Tim Allen, who does an unforgettable job as Buzz). Buzz slowly becomes Andy's favourite, leaving Woody Jealous, he schemes to purposely lose Buzz, but his plan backfires, leaving him and Buzz away from home. I won't reveal much else, but the Idea is so clever, well.. It's hard not to. This is an excellent film, 10/10 Rubbish movie, so many plot holes...; I don't understand why this film is so highly rated. The film has so many plot holes in it I actually lost count. Now before I start this review, I'm not going to say toys talking is a plot hole, the idea of them talking is interesting but it opens up so many other questions that the movie never really explains. Also, don't argue, \"it's a kids movie\", films need to make sense in order to work whether they're for kids or not. This film is so bad and here is why. Even if you like this film, you have to agree with some of the points I'm making here: Buzz thinks he's a space ranger. If that is the case then why does he allow Andy to play with him? Does he not think why is this giant kid picking me up and throwing me around? Buzz however makes no attempt to communicate with Andy. Surely Buzz would try and talk to him? This doesn't make sense given that Buzz doesn't believe he's a toy. Also when Woody hits a button that release Buzz's helmet and he gasps for air, you're telling me Andy never pushed that button? He's owned the toy for weeks yet hadn't pressed all the buttons? Rubbish. The end scene is one of the worst scenes for me. It's broad daylight and two toys are running down a street. Where are all the pedestrians on the street? How are they able to open the back of the moving van truck? Surely the driver would notice doesn't he check his rear view mirrors, or surely a button or signal would come up revealing that a door was open at the back of his truck? Wow any thief could steal from this useless driver. Also when Woody and Buzz fly down from the sky and land in Andy's car. Andy's car is directly in front of the truck driver, how could he possibly not see this??? The most hilarious scene though is when Woody is moving around in the middle of the road and a person in a car honks at him. Woody then ducks in front of the car as it drives over him. 1) Why would you sound your car horn if there was a toy in the road? 2) The driver therefore saw Woody as he sounded his horn. 3) He must have seen Woody moving about and be thrown from the moving van. Does this driver know toys are alive or something? Is it only kids who are unaware? I just don't understand. It's never fully explained. Continuing this point: when the toys all surround Woody and prepare to attack him after he knocks Buzz out the window, we hear Andy from outside shouting. This allows them to return into position. What if he hadn't have shouted though? He would have walked in and seen them. This is why this idea of toys coming to life could never work! No kid would always shout when they enter their room and most kids leave their doors open yet Andy never does - allowing the toys to move around and communicate. Once you take these plot holes into account, the conclusion is that the film sucks and is a really poor movie. Honestly how could anyone like it? An interesting idea that just falls flat. And also the final question that is never addressed is: Why can't toys reveal they're alive to humans??? It's never explained and I don't get why. Poor film 1 star. Awful. Classic Tale Full of Imagination; Toy Story (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) A kid's toy room is split after his former favorite toy Woody (Tom Hanks) gets replaced with the newest sensation Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). The gunslinger Woody can't except the fact that he's no longer the kid's favorite so he and Buzz end up outside of the house and must try and find a way back. The Pixar form of animation has become the standard today so I'm sure many people watching these films forget how groundbreaking this movie was when it was first released. I was only fifteen at the time but giving it a second viewing after all these years just reminds me at why this thing became a hit. Not only is the animation beautiful and extremely life like but we also got a terrific screenplay that certainly brings these characters to life and really makes them something special. The idea of a film being centered on toys that come to life when no one is looking is something so simple yet so genius that you can't help but wonder why it took someone so long to do a film. The screenplay is without question one of the best ever written for an animation movie as all of the characters, from Woody and Buzz to Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) are perfectly brought to life. The child-like nature of the story has so much energy that you can't help but smile at each journey that the toys find themselves on. The amount of imagination in the screenplay is what makes it so special because it really does seem like something a kid would come up with while playing alone in his room with the toys. Everyone can remember what it was like being a kid and playing with these toys and bringing them to life in our minds so to see that played out on the screen is certainly something special. The film has terrific laughs but also a nice message. The voice work is terrific with Hanks and Allen clearly leading the way but that Southern draw of Varney is special as well. TOY STORY was ground breaking when originally released and it comes as no shock that the film hasn't lost any of its impact. The screenplay with its great characters and story is guaranteed to be enjoyed for decades to come. Not just for children!; This is an awesome movie, and it's not just for kids! When I read this in the memorable quotes: Mr. Potato Head: How come you don't have a laser, Woody? Woody: It's not a laser! It's a little light that blinks! Hamm: What's wrong with him? Mr. Potato Head: Laser envy. I knew that this movie wasn't completely aimed at small children. But there were a few things that bothered me. How Andy plays with his toys so nicely, and Sid just takes apart toys and puts them together with other different parts. Isn't that a sign of creativity? Otherwise, this movie was great! Overall this movie gets a 9/10!!!  \n",
       "1  5 + 5 : « addictive and fun as a real game » (tv); I saw a little bit long ago and it seemed dull then. This time, i start another play right from the start and i found it still dull : the young boy appears a bit dumb, his wealthy family not better \n",
       " And then, first comes teen Dunst and i'm really surprised how good she acted (as she never convinced me as Peter's girlfriend). Next, Robin gets in the movie getting out the game and the magic operates : i really like the way past, present and future merge, how the game expands to the big mansion into town. If the special effects looks very tired, the story is original, full of surprises and proves that a humble cast can do as fine as a multiple billion dollars one ! Robin proved one more time he was a never grown-up kid with a beautiful soul with kids and the key to childish fun ! So i had a great time with this small movie as it gives me all i ask to cinema : to find a way to leave (cautiously) my world behind !! Probably worth checking out, even today; There is a lot to like in this movie. The concept was intriguing. Robin Williams plays a basic Robin Williams character, i.e. a man-child. I never would have recognized Kirsten Dunst or Laura Bell Bradley as children without the cast list, but they both performed well. David Alan Grier did befuddlement just as well back then as he does now. Bebe Neuwirth and Bonnie Hunt did nicely, and looked very nice as well. The pace got a bit frenetic for me, though I understand that this was deliberate. The CGI animals looked fine in the distance but up close, not so much. I know we are spoiled by the unlimited effects in films today, but some of these, like the lion, looked terrible. I saw in the credits that they had Industrial Light & Magic, so I doubt it could have been done any better at the time. And some of the things in the ending did not seem to totally follow from the body of the film. It's probably worth checking out though, even today. Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Almost 20 years on and it's still entertaining kids of all ages; Jumanji was on TV today, and my 8 year old son had liked him in \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and I remembered it being fun, so with sweets and crisps we sat down to watch it. Orphans Judy (A young Kristen Dunst, who had started in \"An Interview With A Vampire\" the previous year, but still a few years away from Spiderman fame) and Peter move in to a mansion with their Aunt (Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers) where the find a board game called Jumanji. When they start playing, they free Alan Parish (Robin Williams) who was trapped in the game when he was a child. Robin Williams is always fun to watch and he was very popular at the time, due to movies like \"Aladdin\" and \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and Kristen Dunst was a real talent as a young actress, none of the annoying traits of usual child actors. Of the supporting cast David Alan Grier is fun as a hapless Police Officer, as is Jonathan Hyde in duel roles as a hunter and young Alan's Dad. Defo worth checking out if you have kids, and more than enjoyable even if you don't. Some of the special effects have dated badly, but are still OK, most of the humour is spot on too. My son got a big kick out if it and really enjoyed it. And I thought for a 19 year old special effects laden kids movie it had held up pretty well. review for jumanji.; This 1995 film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game 26 years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are 8+ as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than 8 and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark wild CGI destruction gets repetitive; In 1869, two boys bury a mysterious dangerous wooden chest. In 1969 Brantford, New Hampshire, young Alan Parrish gets picked on by bullies. He finds the box in a local construction site. He opens the chest to find a board game Jumanji. His father is sending him to boarding school. He is about to run away when his best friend Sarah Whittle comes by. They play the game and Alan is pulled into the board game. Twenty six years later, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) buys the rundown mansion planning to open a bed-and-breakfast. She brings her niece Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter (Bradley Pierce) who lost their parents in a car accident. The kids find the board game in the attic and start playing it. Alan (Robin Williams) is released. They track down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) to finish the game and bring all the released apparitions to an end. Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) was a friend who worked at Alan's shoe factory and is now a cop. The game brings out big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) who looks like Alan's father Sam. The basic idea of a board game that comes alive is one with great possibilities. I wish that it is more than just a series of crazy CGI destruction. I wish that the players needed to use their brain power to solve clues. The constant escaping from one thing to the next gets a little bit repetitive. They start piling on top of one another. Williams is not quite as lovable as expected. Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier are kind of fun. There is an uncontrolled quality to this children's movie. once it gets going it's pretty darn fun; i have t say,this movie started out pretty slow,and i thought it was gonna be a dud.i'm glad i kept watching.it turned into a pretty good movie.if you're into action and adventure,you'll certainly find it in abundance here.there are some great action sequences,providing scads of excitement.but there are also a lot of very funny moments,and there's even a hint or 2 of romance.there are some fantastic creatures here.the only downside i can think of is the visual effects.i found them kinda cheesy,and sometimes they didn't quite look real.the creatures sometimes looked a bit wonky,but other times were pretty realistic.but that's a small downside,since the movie is so much fun.Robin Williams is the featured performer here,but i thought Bonnie Hunt was terrific.Bebe Neuwirth was very good as well.but David Alan Grier was a riot.Kirsten Dunst was good too.overall, this is a good movie for both kids and adults.for me,Jumani is a 7/10 Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. Watchable Effects-laden family entertainer, though a bit predictable; This is a watchable family entertainer with some genuine scares. The plot appears complicated but is actually fairly simple. Hordes of wild animals appear and people flee. This happens again and again like clockwork throughout the film making it predictable after a while. On the plus side, Robin Williams is in manic form, and the Special Effects are agreeable though dated. Kirsten Dunst is very appealing in one of her earlier films. This is generally a pleasant watch, but on the whole, I prefer the newer film Zathura, which is also based on a board game. Overall 6/10 Still great to this day.; \"Jumanji\" is still fun to watch, it's an original story and has great performances, directing and dialogue. The film score composed by James Horner is fantastic. The special effects are damn good for it's day. There's no need for a sequel/reboot/remake or whatever the hell it is, it's cheapened this 90s classic. If they want to be respectful then leave this movie alone, stop trying to recreate something that won't work! Almost Thoroughly Enjoyable; If I had been 10 or 12 when this movie came out it would probably be my favorite.  As I was 34, my first reaction was that there was too much screaming. But there's much here for an imaginative youngster (or oldster) to enjoy.  The script is generally witty, and except for the screaming, parents will not be bored watching it -- and if they squint their minds eyes enough to remember what they enjoyed before puberty, they'll get a nostalgic rush. This is everything family entertainment should be.  And though it does involve the supernatural, it is presented in a negative light and none of the characters relish being part of it. Dated, but fun adventure for kids and adults alike; When Steven Spielberg launched 'Jurassic Park' in the summer of 1993, it broke major grounds in the visual effects department leaving everyone with their jaw dropping at the splendid computer-generated imagery of the dinosaurs. The success of the Spielberg brought birth to a new image of computer-generated effects as well special effects to the feast the eyes of viewers everywhere. This fantasy adventure based on the Award-winning children's book Jumanji by Chris Van Allsburg invites audiences for fun adventure in the jungle with computer-generated animals that hit a mark in the state-of-the-art territory at the time of its release, but unlike the superior Jurassic Park sadly look dated and unauthentic by comparison. That is certainly not to say however, that the fun of the magical fantasy excursion and the charm of the highly popular Robin Williams no longer remains. Set in 1995, the film follows a young boy named Peter Shepard (played by Bradley Pierce) and his sister Judy (played by Kirsten Dunst) who discover a mysterious game in the attic of the home 12-year old Alan Parrish (played by Adam-Hann Byrd) disappeared in twenty-six years ago. Upon rolling the dice, Peter and Judy unexpectedly release a thirty-something year old Alan (played by Robin Williams) who reveals to have disappeared into the game. Witnessing the magical powers of the game, Alan, Peter, and Judy team up along with Alan's old friend Sarah (played by Bonnie Hunt) to survive against the horde of jungle animals that threaten to destroy the town until someone finished the game. Lions, elephants, rhinos, monkeys, monsoons, carnivorous plants; all menacing obstacles our characters must overcome as the titular board game send their world in a mysterious jungle-like realm. It is a wild ride brought to life by the a smart execution by director Joe Johnston who knows the magic of Chris Van Allsburg's source material, and translation from book-to-screen by a screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh and Greg Taylor. But the question is \"has it aged well\". In terms of visual effects, the answer is sadly no as the computer generated imagery of the wild animals that release from the board game unfortunately fail to come to life as believable and striking as they did back in 1995. While the film's use of animatronics used on the some of the animals such as the lion have aged well in a way that can send shivers down your in the scene when the hairy creature threatens our young heroes, most of the effects look awfully dated and show evidence of a blockbuster flick released in the mid-1990s. Despite the lack of authenticity perpetrated by these subpar effects, the film luckily manages to stay fun and charming, especially by the comedic charm of Robin Williams who swarms in the movie with livelihood and humility as well as the rest of the cast including Bradley Pierce, Kirsten Dunst, and Bonnie Hunt. As the story progresses, viewers are in for a fair amount of dark, eerie elements including the death of the children's parents, Alan's broken relationship with his father, and the overall chaos that erupts from the game; all of which are enough to leave young children shivering. But with the fun-filled action uprooted in the adventure of the characters, there is still plenty for the family to enjoy. Jumanji may show its age in terms of the effects department, but is still a fun-filled adventure full of laughs, heart, and suspense to keep both kids and adults alike captivated from start to finish. Yes, it is disappointing that it fails to reach the roots of Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park; but that doesn't stop this fantasy adventure of being a friendly, fantasy spectacle. not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late 1960s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. Jumanji! From Book to Film; As a child in 1995, this was one of the greatest adventure films for a kid in my generation. The book from where it came, was good, but the filmmakers made the adaptation pretty darn amazing. The fact that Robin Williams starred made the film better, as Robin was a huge draw to family films of that era. Who ever knew that Jumanji would have a cult following or that it would spawn an actual board game (nothing comes to life), and eventually a sequel in 2017. Too bad Robin isn't here to enjoy or be a part of the sequel. Bonnie Hunt also starred alongside Robin in this film as Sarah, but she's not quite as memorable. Sorry! David Alan Grier also co-starred as Carl the police officer, his acting was somewhat more memorable. One of the most memorable acting performances of the film was Jonathan Hyde as Sam Parrish (Alan's dad) and his dual role as Van Pelt (the hunter from Jumanji). In the end, it was a great film, probably felt more now by some since the passing of Robin Williams. But those of us who've loved the film since the beginning know he made the film what it was. Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Pretty cute, zany adventure.; Let me start this by saying that Robin Was the main draw to this work, although the story is pretty innovative, only having been done a time or two previously. Zany. That's the principal description of this work, between Williams's near-manic performance and the fast-paced action, the busy screenplay, and the frantic sound effects. It was fun and entertaining, if nothing else. Features some monsters and over-sized creatures, so may not be suitable for all ages. It rates a 5.4/10 from... the Fiend :. Wish they had more Jumanji history; My only real complaint with Jumanji is where did this game come from? Who created it? I really wish they could have discovered more about the game's past, it's history. Then it would have made a little more sense. But I'm not saying I didn't like it. On the contrary, I do enjoy it very much, I think it's a cool buried treasure. The characters, the story, the effects all perfect. The cast does a great job in this movie and the concept of a strange magical board game works. I wish there was more monster animals. But the man eating plant and the giant spiders is enough to put it on my page. Robin Williams does great in this first monster movie, wish he do more. But that's just me. Anyway, in conclusion ladies and jelly spoons. This is an assume movie and you can do much worse then Jumanji. 8 STARS. Imaginative (spoiler); This is probably one of the most imaginative movies I have seen in a while. I mean, it has an entire back story, as we can see in the beginning, when those two kids are trying to get rid of the game. Then it goes to 1969, when Alan finds the game, he and Sarah start playing, and he gets sucked into Jumanji. Then, throughout the rest of the movie, Alan comes out of the jungle and he, Sarah, Judy, and Peter continue playing the game and unleashing all these dangerous animals (and Van Pelt) and the monsoon and killer plants into the city. And at the end, those kids in Japan find the game. Very well thought out. Certainly worth a look. An excellent family entertainment achievement, with the keyword family, not just kids.; The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children's book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die! Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter  I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families. Outrageous fun; When young Alan Parish and his childhood friend, Sarah play a board game that Alan found buried near his fathers business, Alan is sucked into the game and left to grow up alone in the jungle. That is until two young children, Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) join the game and release him 26 years later. Every turn in the game becomes a living nightmare that endangers the lives of everyone involved, and the only way to stop it is finish the game. Alan (Robin Williams) and Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) will have to play some more if there lives are return to normality. The concept of the movie is truly original and it successfully delivers on its potential, with an excellent cast and funny script, this adventure is both hilarious and action packed, with some cool special effects thrown in. Great family entertainment 8/10 Very enjoyable fantasy adventure.; Jumanji starts in 1969 in New Hampshire in New England where a young boy named Alan Parish (Adam Hann-Byrdd) & his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) starts playing a strange board game called Jumaji that Alan found buried in the ground earlier, Jumanji turns out to be magical & Alan is sucked into the board game while Sarah runs off. Twenty six years later & it's 1995 & Alan's old house has been empty for years until now, until young brother & sister Judy (Kirsten Dunst) & Peter (Bradley Pierce) move in with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), the two youngsters find the Jumanji game & start playing it themselves as all manner of creatures & climate events begin to appear as does Alan (Robin Williams) who has spent the last twenty six years trapped inside Jumanji & is now an adult. The only way to reverse the effects of Jumanji is to finish the game so with a now adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) the four players must battle whatever Jumanji throw's at them including Lions, Monsoon's, giant Spider's & a stampede... Girected by former special effects man Joe Johnston this oddball fantasy adventure is actually pretty good but there are one or two things that ultimately drag it down to merely a very good film rather than a great film in my opinion. Based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsberg the film is apparently quite different & the two main character's here Alan & Sarah don't even appear in the book, Jumanji is a hard film to categorise as it mixes various ideas & themes like a bad childhood, finding redemption, standing up to your fears, fantasy, sci-fi, horror & comedy. At 100 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace, once it gets going the situation just keeps getting worse & worse as all the chaos & mayhem escalates beyond anyone's control with all sorts of animals running around & the theme of facing your fears is an ever present one. I am not sure there is another film quite like Jumanji & to find something so original & different in a mainstream film is unusual but the CGI effects scenes, the lack of character depth, the refusal to do anything with the plot other than destroy a house & an ultra happy ending which goes on forever that gives every character in the film the best most happy ending is pure Hollywood that was not needed & a slightly darker ending in keeping with the slightly darker tone of the film overall would have been much better. To be honest apart from great set-pieces & the basic concept there's really not that much to Jumanji at all, it's rather shallow & it's attempts at depth are pure heavy handed Hollywood cliché but it's fun & very entertaining while it lasts, just a shame about the last ten minutes really. Jumanji was made just as the CGI computer graphic revolution was taking off back in the mid 90's but the effects do hold up rather well actually, from huge plants to an impressive stampede of Rhino's & Elephant's through a house to a huge Lion with the mischievous Monkey's probably the only real weak effect. As a fairly light hearted fantasy adventure with some darker overtones there's a few amusing moments including a bemused policeman who's car is slowly & systematically trashed & as a whole the film delights in needless destruction & mayhem which is no bad thing. There are some laughs & a few scares as well & I could definitely see Jumanji appealing to both older & younger audiences. With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 this had a very healthy amount spent on it with most going towards the effects I would have thought. Filmed in New Hampshire & British Columbia in Canada. Despite being known as a manic performer Robin Williams is pretty restrained here & his brand of psychical comedy isn't used much, Kirsten Dunst is one of the few child stars to go on & have a successful adult career while the acting generally is pretty good. Jumanji is a unique fantasy adventure that I think would appeal to both children & adults, my only real problem is the sweeter than sweet happier than happy ending which is pure sentimental Hollywood at it's worst. With an ending more in keeping with the rest of the film Jumanji might have got a seven from but as it is it gets a six, good but not great. Followed by Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005) which was shot under the title Jumanji 2. An original plot poorly executed; I was really disappointed with Jumanji. I had heard about the concept and was looking forward to it. It is mean a mean spirited slap stick comedy with no redeeming social value. First of all, you have Robin Williams....I love Williams, when he is kept on a short leash by the director. Left to his own devices he tends to go off the deep end a bit. Then you add the lame script and an over-done score, you get a movie that misses. I gave this movie a 4 because it was an original concept, it had some great cinematography and it had a few really cool special effects. I would love to see this movie remade by a different director a better script writer. Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Unique; I am trying to find my words in order to perfectly describe Robin, but i just realized that it's impossible to do it. Words are not enough to describe such a man... I've seen a lot of people in my life, all kind of people, but i never saw someone having so much warmth and kindness in just a small smile like Robin. That's something which makes you to love him unconditionally. The way he acted in the movies was so original that it can not be compared with anyone else in the history of cinema. He's smile made us all better people a little bit, which means he changed the world in he's own way. He will be always with us, and within us. Let's make him immortal !!! The best of Allsburgh's film adaptations.; Author Chris Van Allburgh has had three film adaptations. His most recent was Zathura, which I didn't like. Before that, The Polar Express was released and re-released. I don't know why because I did't like it that much either. But ten years before Zathura was his first film adaptation, Jumanji. The only one I liked. The only one that critics disliked. Jumanji, for some reason, was a film that I really liked. I'll admit some of it was a bit weird, but I really liked it. I liked it because of Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, two great actors. People don't give Williams enough credit and the same with Hunt. But I love both of them. I also think the film has great visuals and it's a triumph with entertainment. I can understand why critics would call it weird, but I really liked it. You may disagree with me. But there's something about Jumanji that I really liked but I can't think of what exactly it is. Though some parts are kind of odd, Jumanji grabs my attention and I'm recommending it. The Plot: When two kids find a magical board game, they release tons of animals and a person who once played the game when he was younger. This game is like no other.; Roll doubles and look out.  Elaborate special effects highlight this tale about two kids who release an imprisoned player trapped for decades in a supernatural board game. Story line is quite stupid, but this is so much fun to watch. Robin Williams does his thing. A young Kirsten Dunst is charming in this preview of her future talents. Rounding out this mish-mash of a cast are: Bebe Neuwirth, David Alan Grier, Bradley Pierce, Bonnie Hunt and Jonathan Hyde in a dual role. Special effects and sight gags are redeeming. A dark, mysterious, and entertaining childhood favorite of mine; Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good. The end is near!; 'The end is near' was my best thought after an hour of Jumanji. The end of the movie that is. Despite a lot of good reviews of people I hardly know, this film is a first-class let-down. It is the somanieth movie in which Robin Williams comic qualities are abused. The story is about a game, Jumanji, that has come to life. After every move something terrible happens; a stampede or a giant spider attack. The game has to be finished to stop all terrible things happening. Of course Williams' comic talent and the special effects try to safe the movie but everything is overdone. By memory, I recall that the makers promised great special effects; they had used the same effects as Jurassic Park! Yes, they did, but they obviously only got the demo version of the package. Also, poor Kirsten Dunst, having the role of a nice young girl, is transformed is such a prig that all her good intentions fall into nothing. All in all, if you have to choose between watching this movie and cleaning up the house, please clean up your house starting with trashing the video of this movie. This is family entertainment; When two children play a board game a man trapped inside appears and tries to help them finish the game as jungle elements from the game trouble the environment. Shown every Christmas, re-released countless times and still Jumanji never loses its touch with its viewers. This breathtaking imagination of a board game coming to life is as wonderfully exuberant as toys coming to life in Pixar's first film. The concept of a game coming to life is made even more exciting by encoding prospects of deadly animals such as lions, mysterious mosquitoes and violent talented monkeys. Everything is thought of and what a treat we have in our hands. There is now a new definition of family entertainment, known as Pixar. Since releasing Toy Story after this was released they have been dominating the box office with wonderful family tales about sentimental robots, cooking rats and racing cars. And to rewind the clock back 14 years this picture is to be hailed as the beginning of the end. A truly new concept with very little explanation required and a marvellous array of hormonal characters with breathtaking action and enough humour to make you smile, this was and still is marvellous. Family entertainment now either involves a boy with a wand, Harry something, or sitting in your living room watching Simon Cowell make fun of ordinary folk. The reprisal if you want to call it that of non-animated picture was in 2005 where Jon Favreau attempted a step up from this picture, by using the same concept of a board game coming to life and applied it with a sci-fi edge, set in space. Whilst there were moments of good action it boiled down to being a repetitive ideology of this 1995 classic with not enough quick wit and mistimed action sequences with an egregious sentimental intention of brotherly love. This has none of that. There are no overly soppy sentimental parts as the required drama is justified early on. The action continues consistently with first initial deadly elements before the stakes are raised. Van Pelt adds a sharp intake of breath threw his evidently evil hunter, which actually is never properly explained, but that is the point. Nothing is explained, events just happen and we can sit back and enjoy the fun spilling out from every angle. Johnston is the man in the know as the adventure flows with exquisite timing. The scene with the house flood is a perfect example whilst the monkey motorbike stage shows his ability to do comedy. This truly is a remarkable film and is worth watching again and again for its wondrous story, its lovable collection of characters and easy sharp mind. This is family entertainment! good original family movie; Joe Johnston's Jumanji is very good family movie that is well paced. The movie is the story of a mysterious game that involves it's players more than the normal board game. The movie begins with a young boy, Alan Parrish, finding the abandoned game. He talks the girl he has a crush on, Sarah Whittle, into playing with him. Once the game starts, chaos ensues. Robin Williams carries this movie, giving it life. The other actors do okay with the bare dialogue. Joe Johnston uses the experiences on the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies to craft a fantasy world that is believable. Though not outstanding in any way, Jumanji is a fun movie that should delight children with its action and fantasy. 6 out of 10 stars. Very cute, feel good movie; I gave Jumanji 7 out 10, which is a pretty good rating from me. 10 are epics like Gone With The Wind & Lawrence of Arabia, 9 are classics and 8 the near great. 7, like Jumanji, are just good, clean fun; not Oscar worthy movies, but movies worth watching. Robin Williams delivers a fairly straight performance for him, but it works, it is good acting. Kirsten Dunst, does a great job as his love interest and former playmate. Other roles by David Alan Grier, Bonnie Hunt, Jonathan Hyde and Bebe Neuwirth fill out the cast nicely along with the child actors who play Peter & Judy and the young Alan & Sarah. Jumangi was one of the better, more successful films to come out of TriStar. One of my favourite films ever; This film is great, it is definitely a family film (little kids might get scared when there are *SPOILER* guns shooting or when the giant spiders have surrounded the actors,or when a crocodile attacks the man but apart from that it isn't too scary), but it is one of those films everyone has got to see. I first watched this film when it first came onto TV (they now repeat it every year), and I have been captivated by the imaginative story every single time I've seen it. The basic storyline is that two kids find an old board game, but when they start playing, the madness begins- stampeding animals and more! This is a story about friendship, love, sticking together and much, much more. If you haven't seen this film already WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!! Below average action adventure; I knew Jumanji was never going to burst with intelligence or be driven by great performances, and yet despite this I was quite looking forward to it as a holiday blockbuster. Well to put it in simple terms that was a mistake. The films plot stands a chance of being the most convoluted of the year with so many back stories it only ever annoys. It starts of with a young boy called Alan Parish who gets sucked into a board game, at this point I should have left as it only gets more idiotic. After this incident we flash forward twenty years to find two new children have found the game. They unleash Alan who is now grown up and played by an irritating Robin Williams. Along with him an assortment of Jungle beasties are unleashed into their quiet neighbourhood. The kids and Alan must complete the game to restore everything but with every throw of the dice more horrors await. The film resembles an ameturish pantomine in every respect a part from the visual effects. Director Joe Johnston also responsible for the mediocre Honey I shrunk the Kids should have treated the audience like adults, then the film might have gone somewere. However as the movie doesn't treat us like adults and depends totally on its special effects I think its safe to say its a failure. The performances particularly from the children and Robin Williams are predictable and annoying. Jumanji might entertain under 7's or those with IQ's under 50 but for the rest of us it simply is a heavily flawed and rather rubbish piece of cinema Early CGI Makes the Monkeys Look Fake! Otherwise It's Amazing!; An enchanted board game breaks into the real world and the only way out of it is to finish the game! The monkeys look \"washed-out\" and so do some of the wild zoo animals; which is why most of the rest of the EFX are mechanical or use backdrops and mattes. Otherwise a very strong 10 would be my vote, as the casting works and the plot shows lots of imagination and flair. With a \"sly wink\" to \"Peter Pan\", Alan's father plays both his dad and Van Pelt the Hunter. My two favorite scenes are when the house gets folded in half and eaten by the monstrous plant, and when everything swirls backwards into the gameboard. I also love it when the house goes \"wild\" and turns into a swamp complete with nasty alligators. I do not like the scene where the little boy turns into a monkey with a tail. Young children may find it disturbing like the donkey transformation in \"Pinocchio\". \"Jumanji\" is suspenseful and scary but no one actually dies in the film. Therefore, it's much more enjoyable when viewed again. The only one who seemed to hate it was Roger Ebert, but it's only too scary for pre-schoolers. Most \"users\" love it! What \"scares\" me the most in this film: the bats, insects, spiders, alligators, and The Hunter. The sequel will not have the charisma of the late and great Robin Williams. I still miss him. He was a comic genius. If there was a market for it, I would like it to be re-imagined with better graphics like the old \"Star Trek TOS\" reissue.  So you'll help us?; Robin Williams is incredible as Alan in this outstanding adventure movie. The supporting cast is phenomenal. The costumes are conservative. One of the good films in the genre, Jumanji will dare the viewer to play the game. 7 out of 10. 18 years of being a \"favourite\"; I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and \"Jumanji\" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie & it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life. Jumanji; I think that kids would like this movie better then grownups. I loved this movie but my mom thinks the plot is to low. The movie is based on the book Jumanji and is a lot more deeper then the book. My bother thought that the movie was corny and the special effects were so bad they were funny but what does he know? OK maybe the effects were bad but whatever. I mean the movie was made along time ago so give them a break. I thought the movie was really good and the acting was great. Its the kind of movie that if you like it you watch it again and again and again. When I was sick I saw it 4 times and I still thought it was good. All and all I would give this movie a 9. I think that kids would like to see it. The Disney movie that could have been; Hunt and Williams play the parts of shellshocked-delayed stress syndrome surviviors quite well. The story is entertaining and engrossing, with both elements of light and darkness. The effects-well, they DO look a bit unreal-and perhaps that is for the best-it adds a sense of unreality to the story -after all, these things come from a board-game universe! Even Van Pelt looks a bit CGI...and Bebe Nuewerth is a sweetie. Decent family entertainment; On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children. Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it. In the jungle you must wait....; In the jungle you must wait, until the dice reads five or eight. So professes a mysterious board game possessed by dark magic to young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd), a boy with no clue just how far an innocent roll of the dice can take you. From the first ominous drumbeat the game utters, until the last fading tones it plays the film out with, Jumanji is a giddy rush of pure adventure, with a refreshingly dark and primal side to its mayhem. Alan disappears from the 1950's and we fast forward 25 years later. Young orphans Peter and Judy (Kirsten Dunst & Bradley Pierce) are moving into his old family home, so fate (and those damn creepy drums) would have them find the Jumanji in the attic, and continue the game Alan started with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) over a decade ago. Suddenly every jungle creature, meteorological phenomenon and 90's CGI monster erupts from the game into their little town, causing a mess that goes beyond the word havoc. This includes a near feral middle aged Alan, now played by Robin Williams. Together with a most reluctant Sarah, the quartet try to stop the destruction, play the game, but mostly just survive this onslaught. Psychotic monkeys, mutant mosquitoes, an elephant stampede, monsoons, giant spiders (fucking shudder) and crocodiles are but a few of the wonders awaiting them. My favourite has to be murderous Victorian game hunter Van Pelt, played mightily by stage actor Jonathan Hyde, with a pith helmet and an epic mustache that would make Kurt Russell chortle. Hyde does excellent double duty as both the deranged hunter and Alan's stern but loving father, a tough contrast he handles like a champ. I admire the film's willingness to go creepy and dark, despite being geared towards kids. The danger feels real, the game has an eerie mysticism to it, a life of it's own that gives you goosebumps. Not often do family orientated films have a shred of real fear in them anymore, so let's count our blessings with this one, still holding strong today. The special effects are dated in places (those monkeys, man) and wonderful in others (that hardwood floor quicksand tho), but you have to cut them some slack, it being 1996 after all. Williams and Hunt have snarky banter that barely hides their love for each other, and it's one of my favourite on screen pairings he ever had with a gal. He makes Alan resourceful, kind and just a little bit crazy, but the guy did spend years alone in a treacherous jungle straight out of your nightmares, so that can be expected. Amidst the chaos you can look out for Patricia Clarkson, a deadpan Bebe Neurith and David Alan Grier as well. There's a lot of stuff crammed into the film, but never does it feel bloated or crippled by it's own weight, flowing nicely and taking time where it can to develop character and give it's human cast just as much to do as all the crazy jungle stuff. I'm surprised I never saw any of this go down as a kid, because parts of it were filmed blocks from my neighborhood, and CGI was scant back then, so much of it would have physically been there, large and loud. Maybe I did, and have since forgotten. I definitely haven't forgotten any of the film, though, and allow for repeated viewings whenever I have the time. It's one of the best, most thrilling adventure stories of its time and ages well as each year passes. Cue the drums. An enjoyable board game, so an enjoyable movie!; This is one of the movies that I really enjoy, even if I do not like comedy and fantasy that much, by the way I don't like Robin Williams either, he thinks he's a funny person, but he isn't, some of his movies like `Jack', `Good Will Hunting', and some others are quite bad. Most of his movies leave too much to be desired. He's just annoying, because it seems to me that he thinks that everybody who sees him will laugh at the ridiculous things he does, he enjoys making fun of the human body, women, men, etc. I dislike it enormously; however I must say that I really enjoyed this movie even though he was starring and the visual effects were obviously computerized. I was impressed by the originality of Jumanji. It's such an innovative, interesting and enjoyable movie. I liked it because the plot is extremely original, creative and gripping. Who on earth would be able to think of a game like Jumanji? An imaginative game in which journeys, action, fantasy, and perhaps a little bit of terror surpass all things. I like this movie because it teaches us to enjoy everyday to its fullest, we see that Alan Parker was a frustrated kid at the beginning of the movie, but after staying in the jungle until the dice read 5 or 8, he realized how worthy his life was. Also it teaches us to respect others, for instance we see the little boy who began to turn into a wolf after cheating on the game was crying and Alan who was a grown-up person then yelled at him, and made him feel bad, but after that he was sorry since he remembered the way his father yelled at him, so this is a valuable lesson, since it shows that parents must be patient and loving to their family, but sometimes love can be hazardous to them. `Jumanji' is a nice movie for all ages; it's a very risky, but enjoyable game, in which your life is at stake. The board game (Jumanji) was good looking, it was really mysterious and interesting, whoever saw it would love to play it. Overall the movie was a very good one, I enjoyed every minute and especially Kristin Dunst's performance who also played in \"Spiderman\", I also enjoyed Mr. Williams's performance, I'm glad he at last did something worth it. Anyway it was an enjoyable movie, but I'd have loved this if it had been more dramatic, terrifying, sad, etc. 8/10 Not board; Watched this on TV where it was aired as a tribute to the late Robin Williams. It's an enjoyable family-entertainment fantasy adventure with Williams playing a grown man who as a boy was sucked into a mysterious, dark board game called Jumanji, freed years later by a couple of young children who happen upon the game when they move into Williams's character by this time run-down house. Along with Williams also fully-grown girl friend of the time Kirsten Dunst, the four of them brave everything the game throws at them to finish it and free Williams to return to his old life. And does the game throw everything at them! Crazy monkeys, a roaring lion, a jungle which comes to life, hordes of stampeding elephants zebras and rhinos and one very persistent big game hunter. A veritable special effects fest, while the plot amounts to no more than awaiting the outcome of the next roll of the dice on the board, it all makes for good clean exciting fun and who amongst us as never enjoyed playing a board game as a child. The back stories about Williams being bullied as a child, having a fractious relationship with his dad and his adult wooing of Dunst are lightly drawn but all of course resolved happily ever after by the end. Williams is fine after he makes his delayed first appearance, portraying yet again a child trapped in a man's body just as he did in a line going back through Peter Pan in \"Hook\", \"Popeye\" all the way to his breakout part in \"Mork and Mindy\". Dunst offers good support and the kids aren't too gauche and sentimental either. Nice to see \"Cheers\" Bebe Neuwirth get a decent part too. I wouldn't call it Robin Williams defining role but as an update on the old children's matinée features, this was an entertaining feature made the better by Williams engaging performance. R.I.P. to him. Brings back a lot of memories. Still a good ride.; My Take: A terrific special effects-laden adventure. JUMANJI is among those films I strongly remember from my childhood. Along with JURASSIC PARK and its sequel, JUMANJI is among those films I enjoy watching multiple times just to see creatures wreck havoc on a crowded street, monsters crawl in from the dark and other bits of special effects extravaganza. I strongly remember the elephants and rhinos stampeding around the crowded streets, a giant man-eating flower with vine-like tentacles, those messy (and weakly done CGI) monkeys with antics borrowed from GREMLINS, the crocodile and the shot of the house breaking apart. What I didn't remember was how faulty the dramatic interludes were. Which is exactly the point. JUMANJI is a wildly entertaining special effects extravaganza that works much better that way. Director Joe Johnston, who revived old-fashioned pulp adventures with THE ROCKETEER and later made JURASSIC PARK III so much better than it might have been, is such an accomplished action director. JUMANJI is a terrific and highly entertaining, if sometimes perilous, family adventure, though it does make several rest stops for back-stories and a bit of drama which sacrifices the pacing. The movie opens with two kids in 1969 with two kids curiously playing the titular game board which eventually unleashes African bats in the fireplace and sucking in little Alan Parrish (then played by Adam Hann-Byrd) inside the game. Forward 26 years later, someone else has bought the old Parrish mansion and the two new kids (Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce) dig up the old board game in the dusty old attic and give the dice a little role, and all hell breaks loose in town. With a little help from an older Alan Parrish (now played by Robin Williams) and his now older best friend Sarah (delightfully played by Bonnie Hunt), they try to finish what they started, unleashing more special effects behemoth after another. That's just about the \"plot\" of JUMANJI, yet I can go on forever with its visual treats. While the CGI doesn't live up to today standards (not to mention the totally unconvincing CGI monkeys!), but some of them in particular (including the terrific sequences where elephants and rhinos rampage around town and inside the mansion living room) still are eye candy. And, courtesy of director Johnston, there are still well-orchestrated moments of excitement. Stars Hunt and co-star David Alan Grier as a cop having a bad day provide the laughs. Despite some dull moments, which have a very major thing to do with its weak writing department, JUMANJI is still an amiable piece of entertainment. Still worth a look, but you might have the options of fast-forwarding to the really good parts. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5. Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... All sorts of things; As a child Williams is \"captured\" by bizarre jungle survival board game.  He emerges 26 years later when the game is next played by two orphans.  Williams and Hunt give it their best and a young Dunst is effective, while the movie itself is alternately poignant, absurd, mildly if broadly humorous, and very uncomfortable.  If you've bought into the premise and can follow it through the finale is very satisfying. The graphics were superb; This movie was a real hit in our family. The action was intense all the way through. You didn't know what to expect. It was so good I ended up buying it on tape. I recommend anyone reading this should do the same. Think of it as Night At The Museum meets a board game; Jumanji is based off a cartoon TV series that was made into a film in 1995 and stars funnyman Robin Williams who plays a man called Alan Parrish who as a kid played a board game called Jumanji which was been buried since 1869 with his friend Sarah(Bonnie Hunt)in the year 1969.But when Alan plays the game he gets sucked into it as his friend Sarah watched in horror as each time the player plays the game consequences occur and the only way to finish the game is to play the whole thing. Fast forward 26 years later in 1995 and two young children played by Kirsten Dunst (from the Spider-Man franchise)and Bradley Pierce who's parents died along time ago are now living with their aunt as their aunt bought Alan's old house.But when the two kids stumble across the board game as they hear the drums playing in the background in the attic,its up to them to try and finish off where the player left off and free Alan who helps them finish the game with his friend Sarah. But will they finish the game. Overall this film is really good until the very end which was sorta confusing for me. If you seen it you know what it is but it involves time travelling back to 1969 and then back to 1995 again. But still if you are a fan of Fantasy movies,Robin Williams and if you love something to keep you entertained on a lazy Sunday afternoon Jumanji is worth checking out. A lovely little film; This four year-old film, I would highly recommend for anyone out there in fantasy-land. Nice special effects, a very good idea behind the plot and Robin Williams all ensure a thoroughly enjoyable experience if you like action-comedies without the ubiquitous \"Good vs. Bad\" show-down. Jumanji is very different and well worth seeing. I look forward to the upcoming Jumanji 2 next year;  the cast for Jumanji 2 probably needs to include Gerard Depardieu instead of Robin Williams!!!! :-) A little adventurous... and childish.; Jumanji is a great idea.  The movie has great potential and could have turned out excellent and a true action classic. However, some aspects of the movie prevent that.  For example, the monkeys in the kitchen and abroad hardly look like monkeys.  They look like warped, evil, demonic beings with fur and tails that were only made to cause mischief.  Well, sure, you might say that's what the game meant to do, but come on... I think they should have used real monkeys here. Certain parts of the dialogue are a little corny and make one feel as though we're watching \"Spy Kids\", which can sometimes really ruin the feel that they're in a life-or-death situation. The acting was great (some parts it was not), and as usual, Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst put on an above-average performance. The action and crashes and other sequences are a contradiction, in a way.  Here we have fake-looking monkeys, but superbly crafted action. The music, composed by James Horner, is quite dull and does not help get you into the spirit of the movie.  A lower-than-average job on his part. Overall, this movie is really good.  I would suggest watching it if you can get past some annoying areas of the movie. My Childhood; This movie made my childhood. I love Robin Williams movies, Jumanji introduced him to me. Jumanji is a movie that everyone should watch. Robin Williams will again make you appreciate living as he always does in his movies. The movie contains full of fantasy objects. The writer has a really great imagination. I will make my children to watch this movie after all years that pass. While watching this movie as a kid, I was scared, excited and happy. It makes you to feel every kind of feeling. This indicates that the movie has done a good job. I again recommend to everyone. Jumanji appeals for all ages. I am pretty sure I will watch the movie again when I get old with the same emotions when I watched it in the first time. Action and adventure for the kids, and Robin Williams for the adults; Find a comfortable chair, lay out the board, grab the dice, and get ready to play.  But remember:  once you start this game, you can't stop.  If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must. \"Jumanji\" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  The basic premise stays the same:  a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure.  When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things.  Only finishing the game will make it all go away. In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added.  Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself.  He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing.  The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams!  Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter. Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles.  He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt.  The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the \"This is MY baby\" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike. Parrish House's Plans; Hi there! I would really appreciate if you can help me with this. I really love that movie, cause of the old Parrish House. I am planning to build my own house by the end of this year and the model that I have in mind is Jumanji's Parrish House. Of course, watching the movie any architect could design the exterior facade, but it has been really hard to find the floor pans. Does anyone have idea of a web page or any source where I could find the floor plans? In advance I thank you for your help. Kind regards, Ralph A great movie; JUMANJI I loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today! The movie is about a boy who finds a board game called Jumanji. When he takes it home and starts to play it with a friend, he soon realises that this is no ordinary game. He gets sucked into the game and is not released again until 26 years later 2 more kids find the game and release him. Now he is grown up and has to find a way to end this game before everything it releases destroys the town. Due to the sad passing of the genius that was Robin Williams, the TV channels have decided to show all of his movies. Jumanji was the first one I saw. The story to this film is like not her that I had seen before. It was an original idea (unless there is another film I don't know about) that was just so imaginative. It works really well and has a great adventure element about it. The effects are average. This was made in the mid 90s so that probably has something to do with it. The animals were obviously not real. You could see the lion was so mechanical it made me laugh. And the other animals were so obviously computer generated. But it was comical and that just added to the fun of the film. The acting was great. The main character was played by Robin Williams. He was as energetic and full of character in this role, just like he brought to every role he took. Other cast members were Jonathan Hyde, a young Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bonnie Hunt. Bonnie Hunt was brilliant. Her reaction and facial expressions made me laugh a few times in this. Another stand out performance was by David Alan Grier. David was so funny as the cop. His comedy timing was excellent and deserves a mention. This film really does keep you entertained throughout and is just a lot of fun to watch... Even now nearly 20 years later. I will give this 7 out of 10. Normally I end my reviews with a quote from the movie, but this time I just want to say how gutted I am about the news of Robins death. I am a fan of his work. I watched Mork and Mindy when I was a kid and grew up watching Jumanji, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam, Jack etc... There were so many great films that he made. I always saw Robin as so full of energy and full of life. He had one of the greatest smiles in Hollywood and when i saw an interview with him, he seemed so chirpy and happy. It just shows that in front of the camera, you never know what is going on in people's heads. I was sad to hear he had been suffering from depression. Depression is such a deadly illness. I know this sounds stupid, but I am gutted that I was not there to talk to him, help him. I hate to think that he felt so alone, especially as he had millions of fans all over the world that knew him on screen. He made the world laugh out loud so many times. Even through bad times in my life, watching his movies has put a smile on my face. Robin deserved much more happiness than he got. He gave so much to me and the rest of the world and it doesn't seem right that he should end his life this way. I will miss seeing new movies from him, but will always continue to go back to enjoy his old ones. Robin will live on in my house and he will always continue to make me smile. R.I.P. Robin Williams. Built around special effects that haven't aged well; I remember watching this film as a kid and loving it, but revisiting it now is like watching a different film. 'Jumanji' has lost its magic. It came across much better a few years ago, when CGI and special effects weren't as common as they are today. Unfortunately, with the film being so special effect oriented, it hasn't aged well. The effects are dated now and just don't have the same impact as they used to. Having said that, this is still a moderately entertaining film with an interesting and original plot, based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsburg. Robin Williams is excellent as Alan, as you would expect. I enjoyed this film a lot more a few years ago, but it hasn't aged well and has lost its magic. A breathless unforgettable adventure!; I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind... This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure. Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story. Great! 10 out of 10 from me! Excellent!; There is only one way to describe Jumanji: excellent. The plot is very, original, with outstanding concepts packed into each individual scene. After viewing this movie, the wild side of the jungle gets into you, making you want to dare to play the game. Although the computer animation may not look all that real, I still give this movie a 10/10, for an outstanding plot, casting, and spirit, which any great movie has. Entertaining...but one major problem; Jumanji is an entertaining movie. I'm surprised its IMDB \"User Rating\" is only 5.9. I would give it a 7. However, I don't understand why the kids (and Robin Williams) keep playing the game. With every roll of the dice, they put their lives in more jeopardy...along with the lives of everyone in the city. They could have stopped anytime after the bats or the mosquitoes or the monkeys or the lion. But they kept going (under the guise of \"finishing the game is the only way to make everything return to normal\"). I kept yelling at the screen, \"Stop playing Jumanji and you'll be okay.\" Of course, if they had stopped playing the game, then there's no movie. Good fantasy movie...; Well the Jumanji is just a great movie which shows how life is filled with luck and chances... The concept of game of dice is so good and the movie will be a bit of thriller too because we will be curious what may come next when they roll the dice each time.... Williams did his Alan character well, i almost felt like crying when Alan came to know that his family is no more.... The only backdrop of the movie is the monkey. It seems so unusual..... Overall, a good movie everyone could watch....:) Enjoy... :) Game Over, Man; Spoilers herein. The reason this film was made was because they could do the effects. That reason has no power now, and in fact most of them already look a bit cheezy. But there are some interesting elements: --Kirstin Dunst at her peak. --Robin Williams in his best role. Or rather for the role best suited to a manic comic. --A pretty cool house, one of the best in recent memory. --Some clever time folding. --A screenwriter's wet dream: in addition to creating a film world that sucks in viewer into an artificial reality, to have that film world contain another one. That world-within-the world is exactly as far from the normal world of the film as it is from us. Just like the film, it grabs us once we start and won't let go until the end. Clever idea. Not exploited. Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements. I love this movie so much; If you do not love this movie you are crazy. Its filled with action and excitement. I love Sarah Whittle played by the famous Bonnie Hunt. I also like Carl Bentley, a clueless police officer played by the comedian David Alan Grier. This movie is so creative. My sister and I watch the movie every weekend, we do not get tired of it. This movie did not get the awesome rating it deserved. People sometimes do not understand a quality move when they see one. I would strongly, strongly, strongly recommend the movie. Trust me you will love it to death. If you do not... then you are odd. Please watch the movie, try it you'll love it...duh!!! i miss my childhood; 6.6,,,,,,,,,,,,, i don't believe this. 10 people 10,,, anyone who have watched this as a kid will give this a 10... common for heavens sake,,, this is the best fantasy movie that some one could wish for as a kid.......... for heavens sake this movie was not made keeping logic in mind please,, its just fun,,, thats all it is,,,this movie is one of the best memories A KID OF 90S HAVE AS A KID,,,people who hate this movie can go to hell,,,, any parents out there please let your kids watch this,,, they will love you a lot..these are the kind of movies which make me miss my childhood ,,, Throw the dice and take a turn, Jumanji made the critics gurn.; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and based on Chris Van Allsburg's short story of the same name. It stars Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Jonathan Hyde. The story is about a weird board game that when played unleashes hazards from the jungle with every throw of the dice. Once you have started playing you have to finish the game for normality to be resumed. Simple in plot and coming off as an excuse to show off some impressive effects-said the critics- Jumanji defied the critics of the time to become a box office winner and a family favourite. Enough of a favourite to spawn a sequel (Zathura 2005) , an animated TV series and a board game. In truth the film is reliant on its effects to entertain, with the cast (all competent and enjoyable) merely lurching from one perilous throw of the dice to another. But to call the film shallow is wrong and ignorant. There's flecks of bad parenting, peer pressure, grief and bullying, while the impact of a missing child on one town is a noteworthy addition to the story line. You wonder if those critics actually paid attention during their free viewings?. Yes it's berserker family fun, but it's not without worth in the writing too. Besides which, for the action set pieces and the laughs-they alone mean the film has its merits. 7/10 Entertaining family/adventure/fantasy; Released in 1995, \"Jumanji\" is fun movie about a mystical board game from the 1800s, which is found in 1969 leading to the mysterious disappearance of a rich boy. The game is discovered again in 1995 by two orphans (Jonathan Hyde and Kirsten Dunst) who play the game and bring back the lost boy now an adult (Robin Williams). The only way they can stop the havoc the game causes is to finish it. Bonnie Hunt, David Alan Grier and Bebe Neuwirth are also on hand. Patricia Clarkson has a small role. \"Jumanji\" is a great example of the way youth adventures should be done. It's entertaining from beginning to end for children, teens and adults. If you've lost sight of your inner-kid give \"Jumanji\" a try. What makes it worthwhile for adults, besides simply being fun, is that it contains compelling themes and everything ties-up for a moving climax. Plus Bebe Neuwrith looks great (she played Frasier's psychologist babe on Cheers). The movie runs 104 minutes and was shot in Maine, New Hampshire and the Vancouver, British Columbia, area. GRADE: B+ a game not like the other ones; \"Jumanji\" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game \"jumanji\" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy. Epitome of Moronic Hollywood Film-Making; A previous reviewer wrote: \"A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie.\" I agree in part and disagree in part with that comment. The problem is impossible to pinpoint, because there are PLENTY of \"big problems\" with this movie! \"Random hazard generator\" is the PERFECT description of the ancient board game! Random hazard after random hazard until the game ends is what is supposed to pass for \"plot\" in this movie. Did anybody count how many times the game board fell out of and back into the players' hands? That, too is supposed to pass for tension. Ultimately, the film fails because there isn't any development of the back story. What was the origin of the game? Now, that would have been an interesting question to explore! And how does the game work? All we ever see is the game's projection of \"random hazards\" OUTWARD into the reality of the players, but somehow Alan (Robin Williams) apparently was sucked INTO the game. How did that happen, and why doesn't it happen to any of the current players of the game? Actually, the guy in the pith helmet is, more or less, the human villain in this movie, but he is never more than an inexplicable, evil cartoon. Was he, too sucked into the game like Alan, or is he the sole human \"random hazard\" generated by the game? Why is he so determined, not to hunt animals, but to MURDER Alan? The film just glosses over the fact that this sub-plot is actually one of premeditated murder! The hunter guns for Alan simply because the plot demands it. But the movie makes no attempt whatever to explain the character. Never once did I sense any genuine emotional chemistry among the characters. Just a bunch of actors acting - not INTERACTING. The love story sub-plot felt obligatory, never genuine. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt never generated enough chemistry to make me care whether Alan and Sarah got together in the predictable end. All in all, this film has the germ of an interesting idea that is really wasted by focusing on mindless, non-stop \"random hazards,\" poor CGI effects, \"lots of screaming and running around\" and insufficient character development. Except for the precise nature of each \"random hazard,\" the whole film was disappointingly predictable, including the cliché of the almost-kiss in the midst of peril routine. How many zillion times has that been used? The dialog is a similarly endless stream of clichés. The issue was never HOW the game would end - but WHEN. The more interesting issues were never even glanced at. This kind of movie can only appeal to people raised on video games. It was generated by that kind of adventure-for-the-sake-of-adventure mentality, and it has that same kind of feel. This rocks!; Jumanji rocks! The effect of everything is awesome. If Jumanji 2 ever comes out it better be good cause it would be a put down if it was terrible. Robin Williams is a great actor! You could have not picked a better person for the part of Allen. The jungle; This is an excellent movie for all ages. Congratulations to the cast, production, stunts and all the people. And now I want know what's happen in the jungle when Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) was there for 26 years. This should be a good adventure. pretty good, except...; Jumanji is an enjoyable, and at times exciting family adventure. Only one major flaw: the special effects. Jumanji relies on special effects for impact. Nothing wrong with that, only its so easy to tell that they are special effects. Enough fun to get you to sit through it, but they should really find another effects crew next time. 2/4 Exciting Family Adventure; In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called \"Jumanji\", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished. Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human. The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like \"Dead Poet's Society\" or \"Good Morning, Vietnam\"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality. This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor. Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the \"Narnia\" stories). Fortunately, any moralising in \"Jumanji\" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of \"alternative timelines\". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10 Probably not perfect, but very fun; Jumanji is a highly imaginative and very fun movie. The visuals are good, and the story is creative and exciting. The storyline consists of a man being sucked into a board game. 26 years later, two kids find the board game and set him free. However, the game board has already released a few dangers, and those dangers must be stopped. The only way to do that is to finish the board game, and the animals (or whatever else was released from the game) will be put back into the game. There is action and minor thrills, and the movie emerges as being a fun experience. It's kind of creative, and it's an excellent adventure film. Sure, it is a bit cliché'd and the monkeys look pretty corny, but don't let them distract you from the overall enjoyment of the movie. 6.5/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment. An entertaining, chaotic adventure, one which impressed me as a kid and still does now; I first heard of this successful family adventure movie at school in the late primary grades. It must have been new to the VHS format at the time (meaning I missed its successful theatrical run), and a student in my class brought a copy in for show and tell. I think I was interested in seeing it for months before I finally did. I remember watching it more than once on video in the summer of 1996. After those months of anticipation, I don't think I was let down, even if it did seem weird and scary the first time, with all the chaos. I guess I wasn't used to seeing that in films at the time. I've watched it again twice in recent years, after growing up, and both times, I found that it was still entertaining, unlike some movies I enjoyed in my childhood. In 1969, Alan Parrish is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Brantford, New Hampshire, with an upper class family. One day, after being ambushed by a group of bullies, he hears a mysterious sound of drums coming from a construction site! At the site, he digs up a box, where the sound is coming from, a box which was buried there 100 years earlier! Inside, he finds a board game called Jumanji, and takes it home. When Alan is at home by himself after a falling out with his father, his friend, Sarah Whittle, comes over, and he shows her the game. They begin to play it, not realizing how powerful and dangerous it is! Alan is sucked inside, and Sarah is chased off by bats that come out of the game! 26 years later, two kids, Judy and Peter Shepherd, whose parents have died, move into the old Parrish house with their aunt Nora. The siblings hear the drumming of Jumanji from up in the attic, and find the game. They start playing the game without a clue, just like Alan and Sarah did, and dangerous animals begin to come out of it! Also, Alan is finally released after being trapped in the jungle for 26 years! He learns that the year is 1995, and sadly, his parents have passed away. He must now continue the game with Judy and Peter, and reunite with Sarah. The four of them are all players now, and they must finish the game if things are ever going to go back to normal, which will obviously be very risky! The film starts well with the spooky 1869 sequence, when the box is buried out in the dark. After that, it's usually pretty good around the beginning. During the first of my two latest viewings, I remember finding most of the movie dull before Robin Williams comes in, but with my last viewing, I didn't find that to be the case. There isn't much humour during this part of this film, but there is some suspense. When Williams does make his boisterous entry, that's when the humour starts. After that, there's both excitement, with all the action and chaos, and humour. Williams provides laughs with his antics, but the film doesn't rely entirely on him for the humour. Sarah's reluctance to continue the game in 1995, the scene with Van Pelt, the trigger happy hunter from the game in a gun shop, and Aunt Nora and Officer Carl Bentley witnessing some of the Jumanji animals are also funny. Other merits of \"Jumanji\" include some poignant moments, good CGI effects (even if they're not the best, and have been topped since then), and decent acting, which includes decent child actors, unlike some films. All these things are what I think makes this film good family entertainment. really fun movie , Robin Williams excellent as always; Jumanji like Ghost , I surprised myself with the note in Metascore , very low, only 39 ?, the film is very fun , obviously in terms of the film script is weak , plus the cast is good, great Robin Williams as always Kristen Dunst young , and also participation as a police officer David Alan Grier , and his scenes are funny, the special effects at the time are acceptable , plus some people may not like , since the film is not as present (one of the big reasons because I support the remake will have Dwayne Johnson , Kevin Hart and Jack Black) , has good fun characters , some are boring , have really nice moments , and the end of the film hinted that would have a continuation , Jumanji is a good movie , is an excellent pass time , where we see Robin Williams do what do best , take the viewer smiles . Note 7.5 A walk in the memory lane; We (me and my brother) used to watch a cartoon named \"Jumanzi\" every Wednesday, back in 2000. Watching this movie talk me through a walk in my memory lane. The great Robin Williams also makes me nostalgic. 26 years, struggling and surviving, and than fighting back to get their life back. It is called human spirit. Though, every bit of it is fantasy, the plot become more human, when Robin remembered his saviors, who give him another chance in the game. A fairly lively jungle jaunt.; I think when Jumanji was released ten years ago, it was probably an attempt to cash in on the recent success of Jurassic Park. Both films have similar ideas. Using CGI effects to bring all manner of creatures to life. Although not quite as successful as JP, I still found Jumanji an exciting film. Beginning in 1869, in the town of Brantford, New Hampshire, two boys are hurriedly trying to bury something in the woods. This certain something doesn't take kindly to it, and protests in the form of jungle drums. Just before they leave, they pray for the poor soul who should ever find it. We cut to 1969, when young boy Alan Parrish is drawn to a construction site by the mysterious sound of jungle drums. It leads him to a chest. When he opens it, he finds a board game, JUMANJI. Alan has no way to know he is about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime! Showing the game to his best friend Sarah, they become enthralled in the game's seemingly magical powers. It's pieces move by themselves. Words appear in a crystal at the centre. And things have a tendency to come out of it when they roll the dice. Things take a nasty turn when after Alan rolls a 5, the game pulls him into it, where he remains trapped for 26 years. A new family move into Alan's home, Judy (Kirsten Dunst), Peter, and their aunt Nora (a woefully underused Bebe Neuwirth). The game calls to them as it did Alan and Sarah, and they end up releasing giant mosquitoes, a group of mischievous monkeys, a ferocious lion, and a fully grown Alan Parrish (Robin Williams). Alan barely has time to register how much time has passed when he realises there are more rules to JUMANJI then he thought. Everything that has come out of the game so far will stay in our world until a player reaches the end. But getting to the end is easier said than done. The more moves they make, the more dangerous things come out of the game. Reuniting with an adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), our foursome must tackle JUMANJI'S dangers and finish the game once and for all. Although there's not much to Jumanji plot-wise (a trait it shares with Jurassic Park), there are enough thrills and spills going on you'll barely have time to notice. No sooner have our heroes survived one deadly encounter, the film throws in another. That type of dynamic is really what drives the film, and there are times where Jumanji feels repetitive. But it has a decent cast to carry things along nicely. Robin Williams plays it relatively straight, but then I usually prefer his more dramatic roles to his larger than life ones, so it didn't bother me. And compared to most of the sugary shite he was churning out during this period, Jumanji was a nice change of pace. Bonnie Hunt adds some of her own comic touch, who's been left a nervous wreck after witnessing what happened to Alan as a child. The children are not that bad either. That's one thing I like about Joe Johnston's films. The children in his films actually have a shred of dignity to their characters, and are not nearly as precocious as they might have been in the hands of a less able director. Jumanji is certainly imaginative. We get quite a menagerie of creatures on display. Stampeding elephants and rhinos. Giant spiders. Man-eating plants and vines. This could all be a mite too scary for younger kids. But I first saw Jumanji at the age of 12, and I loved it. There are nice touches of humour throughout that help offset the scarier scenes. And there's a funny running gag about a policeman's car that gets slowly wrecked by the different things coming out of the game. Unfortunately, when it comes to the CGI, the effects are nowhere near as dazzling as Jurassic Park's dinosaurs. The filmmakers just haven't got the hang of using CGI. The monkeys especially look fake. And some of the animatronics could have been handled better. Those spiders are very jerky when they move. But the film more than makes up for its shortcomings in the action scenes. Joe Johnston seems to get a certain glee watching his CGI creations running rampant destroying everything, in much the same way Joe Dante did in Gremlins. It's certainly not a boring film. The indoor monsoon is my favourite part, where Alan has to wrestle a crocodile! It's fairly inventive too, when Alan nearly gets swallowed up after the floor turns to quicksand. And the earthquake. Brilliant! If you can simply switch your brain to autopilot and try not to think too much, you'll be in for a fun ride. Overall, Jumanji may be a bit shallow, but you'll find it difficult not to get sucked in.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                very funny.; This film has some of the funniest lines and it's a great comedy. One would probably think, even I, thought that this would probably happen between two older men who fight about the obvious: women, fish and each other. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are a perfect pair. Even though it's a comedy, the romance in it is on the clean side. Nothing too distasteful and the comic relief is still included into the romance, which gives it a continuous comic flow. Even though there is a serious part of the film where John's father passes away, after that scene the film is back to the comic feel, which is nice because there's no dwelling on the sad/serious scene. Nonetheless, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh hard. Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. Is it better than original?; Is this movie better than the original? Perhaps. It's probably funnier than the original. Walter Matthau's pick-up line is one of the funniest things of the movie. But is it better than the original? The original had more of the emotions of Lemmon and Matthau as they fought. This one has less feuding (but still has some of the old pranks) and more focus on the family / dating relationships of the old men. This movie is funny and definitely worth watching. You'll have to decide on your own if it's better than the original. Back For More!; CONTAINS SPOILERS John Gustafson and Max Goldman are back in their first adventure since their last. It's six months later and they're still fishing. All the snow has melted and the neighborhood looks very different. The boys are out to catch a giant legendary fish they've heard tell about.          These men would soon discover big changes happening. Like, their friend Chuck, who died in the last adventure, had operated the bait shop. Ever since his demise, it's been empty, but some people have come with plans to turn it into a ristorante (restaurant). They are: Mama Regetti and daughter Maria. John and Max don't want that to happen so they pull numerous pranks on the Regettis but they still won't leave.         Jacob Goldman and Melanie Gustafson contemplate matrimony. But have their doubts when their fathers insist on planning the event. But when the kids decide the wedding is off, John and Max are back at it. Pulling all sorts of foolish pranks on one another. Max steals John's outboard motor, John wrecks Max's fish net and has his cat scratch up Max's car seats, but Max sends a big dog through John's house. Ariel decides to leave for a while. John was in a real pickle. He tried asking his father for advice, but he had passed away; Max goes on a date with Maria and they decide they like one another.        Pretty soon, it's a wedding day. En route to the church, Max and John decide to fish for the giant musket they're so fond of. They catch it, but John says they must leave it in the lake out of respect for his father, so they do and rush to church. It looks like the wedding of Jacob and Melanie, but it isn't. They eloped. It's the wedding of Max and Maria. John planted Max's dog in the limo as they drive off.        Was this as good as the first? Sure. I'm sorry to say that the three main stars, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith are no longer with us. Meredith died in 1998, Matthau in 2000 and Lemmon in 2001, which is real sad. So it's guarenteed there will never be an Even Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple III. They were really funny men. Why do the good ones always gotta die? But anyway, if you're a fan of these men and you enjoyed the first one, then I recommend Grumpier Old Men! - Delightful acting and script but silly scenes...; Always delighting in Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, warmed by their aging and childish pranks, I enjoyed this film which is filled with delightful acting and fun script.It suffers, however,  from more than a few silly scenes. Funnier than the first!; This movie is downright hilarious with tons of good one-liners. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (may they both rest in peace) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max & John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says \"Holy moly\" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor! Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. One of the best movies of 1995!; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. 7/10 stars. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Grumpy, but not funny; What, I wonder, does the legendary Billy Wilder think of this film starring Lemmon and Matthau, the great team he so memorably paired in 1966's \"The Fortune Cookie\"?  Wilder's film is a dark, cynical satire, and was the first of what is now seven films starring the pair.  Seven films, but only two of them--\"The Fortune Cookie\" and \"The Odd Couple\"--are genuinely funny efforts showcasing these actors' combined talents.  \"Grumpy Old Men\" was mildly amusing due less to the script than to the welcome return of Lemmon and Matthau who hadn't been on screen together in 12 years.  The unexpected box-office bonanza naturally inspired a sequel, but all this equally lucrative outing has in its favor is a brief monologue by Burgess Meredith who, as Lemmon's 95-year-old father, boasts of eating bacon and smoking Camels while the \"experts\" who warned against such vices are taking a \"dirt nap.\"  Not even Lemmon and Matthau can enliven the script by Mark Steven Johnson this time around.  The curmudgeonly Matthau admitted he didn't lke the script for the first film but did it to work with Lemmon, and that the only reason he did the sequel is because the first film was a hit.  No doubt, \"Grumpiest Old Men,\" the inevitable sequel, will be just as dreary. If these pictures make big bucks, why tamper with the formula?  Why hire Billy Wilder to punch up the quality when the public seems content merely to see Lemmon and Matthau rather than see them at their best? \"Good Lemmon & Matthau Comedy Sequel!\"; Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Kevin Pollack, Daryl Hannah and Burgess Meredith star in this 1995 comedy sequel. This takes place about 6 months later where John (Lemmon) is now married to Ariel (Margret) and he and Max (Matthau) are sort of getting along. This time, Max finds romance when he meets Maria Ragetti (Loren), an Italian widow who moves into town and opens a restaurant. Jacob (Pollack) and Melanie (Hannah) are also engaged and things start to get a bit difficult for them which makes their dads feud with each other, but only temporarily. The late, Meredith (Rocky) also returns as John's father and this was his final film. This is a good sequel and like the first film, it provides laughs and a bit of heartfelt moments as well. I recommend this. It has it's moments; Howard Deutch decided he wanted to cash in on the success of Grumpy Old Men and it worked. The only problem to the sequel is that some of the cast seem to be a bit bored by the proceedings. The one liners are enough to make you drop your popcorn. Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon are a joy to watch as they continue to find ways to drive each other over the edge into insanity. And yet Deutch calms that insanity by giving us a quick glimpse into just how much these two men mean to each other when Jack's dad played by Burgess Meredith dies. Lemmon and Mathau are still at the top of their game in this film. In this film the Ann Margaret character is suppose to be the rock, the sound of reason, the calm in the midst of the storm. You believe she is until she has the insanity thrust upon her and is forced to react. For the most part Ann Margaret as well as Daryl Hannah seem bored throughout the entire film. Kevin Pollack is just as good in this sequel as in the original. Burgess Meredith is the scene stealer, he manages with dead pan accuracy to deliver some of the best one liners in the film. Ann Morgan Guilbert manages to match Burgess with her ability to respond to his one liners with shock and outrage befitting her character. And then you come to Sophia. Sophia is in her comfort zone here. Sophia is comfortable with the slapstick comedy and relishes it, she's in the movie, she's not walking through it. She's absolutely stunning to watch but at the same time she adds to the moment. She's as glamorous as ever but it doesn't get in the way. All in all a good follow up to the original. A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances...; A sequel to the thoroughly enjoyable Grumpy Old Men, 'Grumpier Old Men' is A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances. The sequel has the spirit of its prequel & the amazing cast, led by the impeccable talents of the Late/Great Jack Lemmon & the Late/Great Walter Matthau, are in full form! 'Grumpier Old Men' Synopsis: John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. 'Grumpier Old Men' works well as a romantic-comedy, as it has moments of humour & subtle romance. I loved the prequel & I must say, the sequel doesn't fail to deliver. The film has sustained its energy & wit, that one would expect from it. Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is entertaining, although initially the pace is slightly slow. Howard Deutch's Direction is top-class. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is good. Editing also is ably done. Performance-Wise: Lemmon & Matthau shine all through. Its their sheer on-screen chemistry, that alone is worth watching the entire film. Sophia Loren is top-notch. Ann-Margret is impressive. Kevin Pollak & Daryl Hannah leave a mark. Late/Great Burgess Meredith is memorable in his part. On the whole, 'Grumpier Old Men' is a smooth, relaxing watch. forget the fussing; As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Sweet and Sad; In this bright sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\" we find John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) at it again. The rivalry never stops. This time, they are bickering over their children's nuptials, almost causing a wedding not to occur. Sophia Loren co-stars as Maria in this foray into the land of 10,000 lakes as the new girl in town that Max has an eye for. At first, they both hate one another because she is turning his beloved tackle shop into a restaurant. Comedy ensues as Max and John both try to get the restaurant shut down and condemned. Eventually, as in the first film, love finds a way. However, sadness veils over as well when Burgess Meredith's character dies. Other than that, the film is very enjoyable. great; This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in 1995, 2 years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie 8 out of 10. Grumpier Old Men Too Sedate *; While Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were an excellent team, they bombed in this film but good. What's so grumpy about Lemmon in this film? The prequel was much better. Ann Guilbert, as Sophia Loren's mother, is given little to do. Remember her as the grandmother to \"The Nanny?\" Sophia Loren, other than marrying Matthau, is also give nothing to do. Ditto for Ann-Margret, Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak, all of whom were so good in the original but are reduced to practically nothing here. I also resent Matthau, who shows off his part-Jewish heritage marrying in a church at the end. I found this to be offensive. Sorry, but that's the way I am-old fashioned. To all those criticize me for the last statement, how would you have felt if the Matthau-Loren nuptials had taken place in a synagogue? While I realize that this was a comedy, this still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. A non-religious setting would have been the only solution to this. Sophia, twenty years later at 80, is still spectacular.; I saw a picture of Sophia on her eightieth birthday, demurely covering herself with a sheet and a heart-melting smile. All I could think of was the scene where she hitched up her bra and marched through the bar, and every man looked, and I do mean every man. I read later that she had \"improved\" the script for that. A reviewer in the SF Chronicle wrote later that she said she had had no \"touch- ups\", and if so then \"her genes need investigating.\" I remember her many films where her beauty was so natural that it was a wonder any man could concentrate on his lines. She never traded on it, but on her talent as an actress. Carlo Ponti was a lucky man: beauty without guile, talent without pretense. Italian pizza were like street food. When she heard we had so many pizza parlors, she thought we must be a poor country. Then she visited, and dined on American pizza. She reconsidered, gracefully and graciously. The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from 1995. The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe 8yrs old, and must have seen it over 100 x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it 15 minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. charming and funny light romantic comedy; It may be just me but I found Grumpier Old Men way way better than Grumpy Old Men. I laughed more and got involved in the plot much more. That it is totally 100% predictable every step of the way is only one of its charms... its how you get there where the fun is. And these actors turn in surprisingly memorable performances for such a slight film. I thought Sophia Loren turned in one of her most charming and funny performances, as did everyone else. The story was just more interesting and three dimensional than the first film and flowed more organically. The story line is simple ancient classic romantic comedy that these veterans had done so many times, it seemed for them like doing a well-known dance. The fun is not in surprises but in going through the old steps with joy. The actors move through their paces with simplicity and enthusiasm and the film actually captures very well the effects of love. The whole film hangs together and works in a way that, for me, the first one didn't. It gets airborne. It deserves a higher ranking than my seven except the story is a little too well-worn. It also allows the two protagonists to get a little more real with each other. Even the three charismatic animal actors get caught up in the spirit of fun. One thing about the film that gave me trouble was that all four women being courted in the film are talented, accomplished, strong and magnificent while all four of the men are hamstrung. I found it mysterious that these women, dropped by some miracle into this tiny town, would be so strongly attracted. Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. Mini Ha Has In Minnesota; It's just possible that the intention was to shoot four Grumpy Old Men titles featuring the four seasons because after the Winter setting of the first one we are now in Summer though theoretically such a cycle should have begun with Spring and ended with Winter so maybe the cyclical thing was an afterthought. Whatever we have virtually the same cast doing virtually the same thing with one absentee and two replacements one of which, Anna Guilbert is actually a native of Minneapolis adding a touch of authenticity. If it was unrealistic that Ann Margaret - who, after all, was teaching English at university and would by definition have access to dozens of eligible males - would marry Jack Lemmon in the first film it is equally unrealistic that Sophia Loren would wed Walter Mattheau here other than for feelgood reasons. On the other hand it's probably churlish to nitpick in this way when the film is only intended to entertain. Which it does. the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. The good, the bad, and the just plain miserable...again; It's not uncommon for a movie sequel to do little to the formula that made its predecessor so financially (and hopefully critically) successful. The old \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" method of filmmaking has been used in the Hangover, Home Alone, and Taken franchise to only modest success in terms of quality. However, in Grumpier Old Men, the sequel to the fine comedy Grumpy Old Men, handles the rehashed formula better than many film sequels do. While I'm getting to sound repetitive and out of descriptive words, this is largely because of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's chemistry together on-screen. From the moment they appear, it's almost impossible to believe the men's friendship in real life wasn't lifelong and consisted largely of playful torment, vulgarity, and several boys nights out. Had the film been a sequel with few returning cast members (say Lemmon and Matthau were substituted by two other actors), this sequel would've likely been a somber affair to view. In a way, I'm thankful the town of Wabasha Minnesota hasn't really changed much since our last outing, with the exception of John Gustafson (Jack Lemon) marrying Ariel (Ann-Margret) from the original film. In the meantime, John's dad still lives off a diet of beer, cigarettes, and bacon and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), John's cantankerous neighbor, still finds himself engaging in petty neighborhood battles with John about outwitting the other man. However, the big ordeal this time is not competing for a new neighbor's love but trying to save a local bait shop from becoming a \"restaurante\" for Italian cuisine. The restaurant is managed by Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren), a gorgeous but uncompromisingly strict woman who catches the eye of Max even as him and Jack plan to foil the restaurant's forthcoming prosperity. Other events (aka subplots) occurring in Wabasha are the wedding between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah), a plot which would later be used by the same director Howard Deutch in The Odd Couple II, also starring Lemmon and Matthau, along with John trying to get his father (Burgess Meredith in his final role, which was burdened by spouts with Alzheimer's and difficultly remembering lines, some female company as he gets older. One of Grumpier Old Men's immediate issues is that there is simply too much going on between plot-strands that involve marriage/romance troubles (I counted four including John's brief trouble with Ariel later in the movie) ad others that involve trying to sabotage the bait-shop-turned-restaurant. Grumpier Old Men may have too many new ideas for cutesy subplots, but it keeps the tone and feel of its predecessor alive and well. It still feels like Wabasha is the location of a sitcom with its oddball situations that seem to consistently bear hefty consequences for its residents, but its characters still feel like real people we've come to known and care about. Unsurprisingly, Lemmon and Matthau share unbelievable conversational beauty in the way they engage in simple discussions that seem to constantly end in uproariously funny bickering. Once you minimize your focus on that aspect in the film, you have just an average comedy that, while charming and pleasantly safe (a good and bad quality for this particular kind of picture), is just grateful to be buoyed by two very talented leading men. Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Sophia Loren, and Burgess Meredith. Directed by: Howard Deutch. Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the 1st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10 Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. 2/5 stars - John Ulmer Great!; This is a rare sequel. Wait a minute, sequels aren't rare. Well, that's true, but a *good* sequel is rare. Most of the time, sequels aren't even in the same league as the originals. However, due to excellent writing, a superb cast and great direction, this film is every bit as enjoyable as Grumpy Old Men. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made several films together and they worked together extremely well. The gorgeous Ann Margaret reprises her role from the first film and is now Lemmon's wife. A new lady hits town and Matthau is very interested. This lovely creature is played by Sophia Loren, who is still stunningly beautiful. Burgess Meredith is great as Grandpa. The stellar cast ensures great acting. However, this film is also written such that there is literally a laugh nearly every minute. I found the film to be highly enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh. 1/10; this movie sucked! I hate it! It's so boring! The acting is so bad! Why does Sophia Loren's italian character talk english to her italian mother when they're alone? The script is so bad! It's so corny! Max and John fighting with the fishing things is so silly! This movie was never funny! It was painful to watch, i'm telling you! Avoid it! Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Oh, How The Mighty Have Fallen...; GRUMPY OLD MEN (3 outta 5 stars) GRUMPIER OLD MEN (2 outta 5 stars) I dunno why I even bothered to watch the second one. Oh, I guess because it was on cable TV shown as a double bill with the original \"Grumpy Old Men\". I liked the original when I first saw it. It was not the best work by the Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau team... but it had its moments... these two actors could probably read pages from the phone book to each other and still make it funny. Unfortunately, the sequel has even FEWER of those moments. Still, I maintain that no movie with either Lemmon OR Matthau in it can be *totally* worthless. This is probably as close as they ever got, though. (Bear in mind that I have not yet seen their last movie together, \"The Odd Couple II\".) Practically the same plot as the first movie... Lemmon and Matthau play lifelong acquaintances and next door neighbors who are constantly bickering about fish and/or women. Burgess Meredith plays Lemmon's FATHER... and if you find old people talking dirty hilarious then you'll probably love his scenes (especially in the closing credits outtakes). Ann Margaret and Sophia Loren play the women in the grumpy guys' lives... hard to imagine that women as attractive as they still are would want anything to do with these two old dorks but, hey... I guess pickings are slim after 65. The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down. Pretty Dang Funny; John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. We often expect sequels to be weaker than the original. But sometimes we may be pleasantly surprised. In this sequel, the \"grumpy old men\" are still up to their old tricks, going after each other and teaming up to close down a restaurant. Some of it may be a bit far-fetched (in real life, a store owner would get the cops involved) but it's good fun. Sadly, the film has the distinction of being Burgess Meredith's final film. On the plus side, he really goes out with a bang. His acting and delivery of witty lines is top notch, and the film does a great job of hiding his Alzheimer's. You can really feel the talent in his character. Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Grumpier Old Men (1995) **1/2; More of the same for those who enjoyed the first film, nothing great but a decent time killer. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return in their twilight years as the ever-battling duo, but this time with the added attraction of Sophia Loren who still looks gorgeous at age 60. She winds up posing a threat to their favorite bait and tackle shop when she decides to take it over and turn it into an Italian restaurant. Since Lemmon's already got sexy Ann-Margret as his hot girlfriend, Sophia hits it off with old man Matthau (ah, the magic of movies), who does not look as good for his age (75). Burgess Meredith is better used in this one in his role as Lemmon's naughty old pop. **1/2 out of **** Cute sequel that works; Fun story of two older men who never quite outgrew boyhood, and the ladies they love. What a treat to see two master actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, working with silly material and enjoying every minute of it. The lady loves, Ann Margret and the ever-sexy and dazzling Sophia Loren, do equally well with a lightweight, sometimes over-the-top script. The principals are aided by a uniformly fine supporting cast, including Burgess Meredith as the Lemmon character's outrageously lecherous dad, and Ann Morgan Guilbert as Sophia's feisty mama. The older players' interaction is a delight. My only quibble with this film is the fact that Meredith's character dies without getting married like everyone else. Why? I wondered whether Meredith had perhaps expired during filming, but, according to Wikipedia, the actor lived a whole two years following this movie's release! The original film, \"Grumpy Old Men,\" takes place during a picturesque Minnesota winter, with snow used to charming effect. The follow-up capitalizes on a Midwestern summer. Like apples and oranges, both productions satisfy. A vibrant sequel that's still underwhelming; I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They seem to work perfectly together, and with a better script, this movie could be gold. We are taken back to Minnesota to re-visit the old grumps who now have to plan a wedding for their very plain and very boring children. There's a reason Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah have never had substantial film careers- they're very uninteresting actors. But I digress. If \"Grumpy Old Men\" built up it's laughs, \"Grumpier Old Men\" topples them down. The best moments of both films are when Lemmon and Matthau trade vicious insults at one another, and also play pranks on each other. But when this is taken away, we're suffering every old cliché in the book, including Walter's tiresome 'Wholey Moley' line which is used so much, it could be taken into context for a Shot Party (take a shot every time Matthau 'Wholey Moley''s himself). The other problem with this series is the fact that gorgeous women fall for these two farts. Roger Ebert made a very valid point in his review for this film- first Ann-Margaret moves into the neighborhood and marries Jack Lemmon. Now the even more gorgeous Sophia Loren has set her sights on the incredibly unattractive Matthau. And why? For concepts in the plot. There's no reason a woman as beautiful and intelligent as Loren would fall for the dull and disgusting figure Matthau is. I know this is a comedy, but come on now! All in all this sequel is peppier and a little more fun then the original, but both movies suffer from overblown dramatic passages that are not needed. We want to see the old guys go at it, not Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah. I laughed a lot at this movie- mostly at the incredibly underrated Bergis Meredith as the foul-mouthed Grandpa. Since all three main actors have passed, we'll never see them again. At least Margaret and Loren are still alive and kicking. I'd love to see their movie: \"Grumpy Old Widows\". As Good As The Original; Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\". I don't agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love \"Buddy Buddy\" and \"The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile. after you have seen the first there is no point seeing this one; After the fun of watching Lemmon and Matthau act like kids for less than 2 hours (i.e. from the first movie) I was satisfied, but then due to the success of the first movie the producers decided to give it another twirl, this time the story had the two starting off as friends thanks to the incidents that happened in the ending of the first film, but then some really really idiotic stupid reason, they were at it again. The movie was not funny as it was like a replay of the first, same pranks, similar plot and screenplay made this movie a waste of time. After getting a mate for John, they (the producers) decided to get a mate for Max, with nothing to write home about but a lame script that just showed no finesse or true plan, just the producers hoping to bank on the success of the previous movie. The main disappointment in the movie for me was Sophia Loren; her acting was just too weak for me to understand that she is a star. Everybody else in the movie even Burgess Meredith (who had Alzheimer's disease and this was his last motion picture appearance) was impressive, at least that I can give them. The movie is directed this time by Howard Deutch, who later worked with the duo in 1998 for Odd Couple II, Deutch other movies also have not been well received like Getting Even with Dad (1994) and The Whole Ten Yards (2004), which are basically the reason why I will not bother seeing My Best Friend's Girl. The movie plot carries on 6 months after the incidents of the first, where both John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) were getting prepared for the wedding of their children. Then a new arrival in town a beautiful lady by the name of Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) came in to change things by turning the towns bait shop to a restaurant. John and Max join forces to try and run the new lady out of town, but the issues between John and Max's children marriage plan caused both to reignite their feud as both refused to believe that their child was at fault. Only the ladies are alive till today (February 2013), as both Lemmon and Matthau died like half a decade after this movie release. Grumpier Old Men was a box office success in its own part, but a huge critical disappointment, as the movie cost 10 million dollars less than its predecessor and made like a million more in the box office. After you have seen the first there is basically no point why you should bother seeing this one, because it will stand in my mind as one movie I credit as a waste of time and talent. www.lagsreviews.com Good Laughs; Grumpier Old Men (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to Grumpy Old Men have Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau returning with more fights and foul language. This time out Lemmon is still happily married but Matthau is on the move and takes a special interest in an Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved to town. I think the most remarkable thing about this film is how well Loren looked. Even at 61 she's still a head turner and her comic timing isn't too bad either. I'm sure this film was only made because the first one made money but it doesn't really matter as no one should take this too serious as it's just a silly comedy meant to make you laugh. There are plenty of nice laughs here but I don't think it's as good as the original. This certainly isn't in the league as The Odd Couple but we do get a pretty good throwback to that film here as there's a scene where Lemmon has to spend the night with Matthau but can't put up with his dirty house. Ann-Margret returns but is pretty much wasted as is Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak. The perverted Burgess Meredith is back and steals the scene every time he's in it. Both Matthau and Lemmon are naturally very good and they easily slip back into their roles. It's priceless watching the two men work together even when the material isn't as strong as one would hope. Lemmon gets a special notice here due to a very touching scene with Meredith. Another problem is the direction, which has one of those \"made for TV\" feels to it. In the end this film could have and should have been a lot better but the cast make it worth watching. Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT 7 out of 10 OLDER, HORNIER AND STILL FRUSTRATED IN MINNESOTA;  `Grumpier Old Men' is a film that is a sequel to `Grumpy Old Men.' Reprising their original roles are Jack Lemmon as John Gustafson, Walter Matthau as Max Goldman, Ann Margaret as Ariel, Burgess Meredith as John's father, Kevin Pollock and Darryl Hannah as the children of Max and John. They are still next-door neighbors, only now the feud has subsided. Their children are living across the street in Ariel's house.  The marriage of their children is on the horizon. The setting for this film is summer and fall in Minnesota.  Fishing is still the main sport where `Catfish Hunter' is still the elusive prize.  The bait shop on the lake has been closed since Chuck passed away.  It is now under new management.  John and Max are anxiously waiting the reopening.  To their surprise, it is not being reopened as a bait shop, but a ristorante (restaurant).  Here enters Sophia Loren as the new proprietress Maria Sophia Calotti Ragetti.  Ann Guilbert who plays her mother joins her.  When Max and John find out the new plans for their favorite bait shop, they set out to undermine her plans for a grand opening.  A series of misunderstandings set off a domino effect that touches everyone's lives.  New loves are found and an old feud is rekindled. All of the same emotions that were in the previous film are in this film. There is laughter, sadness, anger and happiness.  Catfish Hunter makes his film debut, which, in essence, puts a `face' with a name.  His film appearance pays credence to the fact that he is a `real' fish and not just a myth.   The acting in this film is superb both by human and non-human.  Still having a good ol' time!; I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men back to back, so I could see both instead of my normal rent one sequel at a time ordeal. I just finished Grumpier Old Men this morning and was expecting a modest sequel, but it turned into a great sequel, pretty much to the point where I enjoyed Grumpier Old Men to Grumpy Old Men. Despite the fact that they use some old jokes, this was a fun plot and I thought the guys have gotten even funnier, including John's father, he's a little dirty, but so much fun to laugh at. John and Max are now best friends again and couldn't be happier with each other, their son and daughter are about to get hitched, and they are overwhelming with the wedding plans. Max is starting to get lonely though, since Chuck has passed on, the bait shop is given to two older Italian women, one lady, Maria, starts a little feud with Max wanting to turn the bait shop into a restaurant. But their anger turns into a hidden passion and they end up falling head over heals for each other, but Maria has some hidden skeletons in her closet. Grumpier Old Men is proof that you are never too old to fall in love or have your heart broken again. It was so sweet seeing Max fall in love with Maria, I loved their passion for each other, it was so fun to watch. John's father and Maria's mother were just so awesome and funny, they had such great chemistry! I would highly recommend Grumpier Old Men, it's a great comedy that once again touches your heart and tickles your funny bone. 8/10 funny funny; I, too, found the film very funny and until reading about it here couldn't remember who played the other woman with Burgess Meredith at the end of the film, the scene that made the whole film complete.  Without giving away what happened at the end of the film, the other woman was that gorgeous elder lady of many great films - Sophia Loren.  What a delicious surprise!  Good also for any old grumpy man! Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter & Jack's previous films together. It was this film & the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max & John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. A sequel that's equal to the original comedy; The first go round was such a hit, that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau got together for this sequel to the 1993 smash hit, \"Grumpy Old Men.\" And \"Grumpier Old Men\" is every bit as good as the first film. It has some new characters and the scene changes from winter to summer, then winter and spring. Most reviewers don't talk about the surprise of the wedding in the first film. And I won't do that for that film or this one. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) team up for a time in the movie to plan the wedding of their daughter and son, Melanie and Jacob (played by Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak). And, later, to try to thwart the conversion of their bait shop into an Italian restaurant. Sophia Loren is the added ingredient for much humor as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti. She's a cousin of \"Spaghetti\" Ragetti, whom John and Max know. Her mother is in the picture, Mama Ragetti, played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. And, grandpa Gustafson is back, with Burgess Meredith now a couple years older. He tells son, John, as they sit by the lake drinking beer, that he sometimes thinks God has forgotten about him. The hijinks and capers in this film include some hilarious pranks the two friendly enemies pull on the Ragettis. As with the original film, this one supposedly takes place in Wabasha, Minnesota. While it is a real town on the Mississippi River border with Wisconsin, the filming for this and the earlier movie was done in a number of places around that area of southeastern Minnesota. So, anyone going to Wabasha won't find the fishing lake, the town overlook or some other scenes shown in these films. With the 10 films they made together  especially the nine comedies, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have delighted audiences for decades. May they outlive Catfish Hunter and continue amuse people for decades to come. Loren is still hot; Grumpy old men was an OK comedy with a nice performance by Ann-Margret, but otherwise forgettable. This film, on the other hand, has some real comic touches that actually also have something to say about the aging process - and life really doesn't end until it ends. But first the bad news: Daryl Hannah. I've liked her in other films, but she is so flat in this, she's a distraction. She doesn't have the feel for these characters, not even her own, and so doesn't quite fit. She's not even credible as the mother of the young girl who is so important in her relationship to great=grand-dad Burgess Meredith. There must have been some plot device they could have come up with to leave her out of the picture altogether; oh, well. Now the really good news: Sophia Loren. I admit I have always had a crush on her since I saw Houseboat as a kid; and when I saw the shower scene in Arabesque, i couldn't sleep for a week. Her performance here is splendid (romantic comedy is one of her strengths, after all), but the really really good news is that she was past sixty when she made this film, and she looks hot enough to burn a young man's fingers! Really - if I'd been Walter Matthau in that bar scene, I'd have gone out with a heart-attack right there - and smiling. With an adequate script, and such superb actors, Deutsch wisely lets the formula roll on without interference. Consequently, whatever the short-comings there's plenty to remember fondly from this film. Oh, and don't miss the blooper-reel that runs under the final credits - Matthau and Meredith are having a grand old time. Oh, and Sophia Loren is still hot. not much fun; Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still combative while maintaining their truce. John is married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) now and his father (Burgess Meredith) is still spry. Everybody is chasing after the big fish Catfish Hunter. Meanwhile, their children Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are planning to get married. Newcomer Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in Wabasha to buy the bait shop and turn it into an Italian restaurant. It's a continuation that's missing much of the fun. It is contrived. It's great to see these great actors working together but that's all I got out of it. I found very few laughs. Who would have ever guessed that it's the same place?; For the most part, \"Grumpier Old Men\" is pretty silly. Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still at each other's throats when Italian immigrant Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in town and throws everything into flux. What actually struck me most about the movie was how different the town looked in this one from the original. Obviously, it was a different time of year, but maybe the different look was meant to show how everything might be changing in the town. Other than that, Ann-Margret returns as Ariel, and she's still as free-spirited and vivacious as she was in the original. Burgess Meredith - in his final role - is still the grandfather who can exercise absolute authority over the youngsters, although he now has the hots for Maria's mother (Ann Morgan Guilbert, aka Millie on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\"). Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah also reprise their roles from the original...ah, and there's that fish. All in all, a fairly interesting movie. Not any kind of masterpiece, but it showed that Lemmon and Matthau still had it. Snoozing sequel with the leads in need of some No-Doz; Woeful, disappointing sequel to 1993's hit \"Grumpy Old Men\" is more retread than follow-up. The two crotchety neighbors--Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--bicker over their children (who will soon be making the sparring oldsters in-laws!) and, of course, who has the better fishing skills. They stop trading insults long enough for Matthau to begin irritating a new woman in town, a fiery Italian who has just opened her own restaurant. Sitcom humor with a sometimes-raunchy twist that is no longer fresh. Almost worth-seeing for Sophia Loren's funny, lively performance, but everyone else looks a little sleepy. Ann-Margret (who married Lemmon's character at the end of the original) must've dropped in for a day and a half to complete her work. As the youthful couple, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah are also under-used. ** from **** A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life & Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau & Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman & John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a 7.4 out of 10 As equally funny as the original, but with an Italian flair!!!!; This sequel to Grumpy Old Men is as funny as the original. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and the rest of the cast from the original movie reprise their roles. John and Max are still feuding, but the tension between them has softened. There are, however, some changes: Ariel and John are married and there's a new girl in town named Maria Ragetti. She's moved to Wabasha to open up an Italian restaurant at the former Chuck's Bait place. When the boys discover what Maria's intentions are, they hatch a scheme to ruin the grand opening of the restaurant and try to keep Chuck's business going, even though the inventory of the former business has been cleared out and the interior remodeled to look like an Italian restaurant. Max and Sophia meet, but there's a disagreement about what the place should be. Maria goes to the neighborhood bar to try and reason with Max, but to no avail. It seems as though Max and John have trouble saying goodbye to what is no longer there. The humor between Lemmon and Matthau's characters is still spiced up and is still able to put viewers in stitches. Then, Max and Maria get married, and the restaurant starts selling bait, as well. Great movie, great cast, great fun!!  \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                        An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Feel Good Movie; The acting in this film is phenomenal, especially on the part of Angela Bassett who always does an amazing job (see What's Love Got To Do With It). The inter-cuts work well where they are placed, much like all of the other shots, and keep the films pace and the viewer interested. I've read other user comments and I find their opinions to be completely biased and unwarranted. If you're watching this film looking for profound insight to life you will be disappointed. This film is an adaptation of Terry McMillan's critically acclaimed novel FOR BLACK FEMALES. Waiting to Exhale explores the lives of four female friends. Each woman makes mistakes and has to deal with those consequences. But it is through being there for one another that they overcome these problems and others. For me, most of the negative user comments are from people who the film was not made for, that are only analyzing the film from the story. There is more to a film than it's narrative and when base your full opinion on that alone you are missing out. Plus, for me, it's just flat-out annoying when people who are completely not the target audience bash a film. Note: this is not to say that art cannot breach color, age or sex barriers. But be let's be realistic for a moment. If say, a heterosexual, black, 21 year old female studying Art was asking you for a good movie suggestion for a Friday night...Would you suggest The Dukes Of Hazard? I think not. Not unless you were joking.

My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT.

Excellent for the broken heart...; Perhaps the reason they call this movie a chick flick, is because that's exactly who it's aimed at. Women. I don't see this as a man bashing movie, but more as a \"how do you deal?\" type of movie. It covers every situation: The unworthy co-worker, The drug-addict boyfriend, the gay husband, the cheating husband, the married man, the New Years fling, the sweet attractive neighbor, the teenage son....but most importantly, it show how women react and deal with the lies, the cheating, and the friendships between both men AND women...and how to survive from that. Any woman who has ever gone through a relationship can relate to this movie, regardless of race, situation, or age. You will want to scream, cry and laugh throughout the whole movie, and I can guarantee that every woman has got a little Angela Bassett in her, especially when she rips through her ex-husbands belongings. Two thumbs up...A definite must-see for any woman with a wounded heart. Don't Exhale Just Yet; I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It's not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others, it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However, the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria -- even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger, Holly Hunter, Alfre Woodard and others. Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight, insecure no-nonsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight, but she was the only one who found it (and deserved it). She was the only one who didn't sleep around, wasn't a man basher, set a good example for her son, and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face -- look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things, her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent, good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie. Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package --- beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life - she could now start her catering business, she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end. Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book, you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men. Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same -- Whitney Houston being well groomed, pretending to be well spoken and classy, and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise (although she might have been too young). The character had to tell us she was smart -- in a phone conversation with her mother she said \"I'm smart, I'm a good person and I work hard.\" Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills, doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end. This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn't \"tell this story\" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were. Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue? Extra in Movie; I was actually an extra in this movie and had a quite a fun time hanging out w/the cast/crew. I had an opportunity to be at several of the locations for days of filming and it was a lot of work. You don't realize what a day of filming entitles until you actually do it and I was just an extra. I was more interested in the process of the film making than being on camera so it was a great opportunity. I even got \"spoiled\" and met a lot of the cast and drove around in the SUV's that are for the main cast...fun stuff! I think over all the movie was to enjoy for fun. I think the basis of the friendships were the most important aspect of the film. That through all the craziness of men in their lives they were still there for one another. This film does Terry McMillan's writing no justice; This movie had great potential had it landed in the right directors hands (as seen with How Stella got Her Groove Back).  Many rough cuts, sloppy editing, and terrible lighting at times to name a few.  Casting was excellent with the exception of Whitney Houston who has the tendency to over-chew her scenes.  Though much of the book was not adapted to the film the strength and love amongst four friends was apparent.  It was the one thing that was not lost or left on the cutting room floor.  Good movie, better book. Waiting to Exhale (the movie) ***** (5 stars) Waiting to Exhale (the novel) ********** (ten stars) A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops & horrible movies. My favorite movie ever !; I'm so surprised by the comments i read here. Since i saw that movie maybe 10 years ago now, it's one of my favorite movie ever along with boomerang.Maybe it's because i was fairly young when i watched those movies.. but i find them extremely good. I watched the movie before i read the book and it may be the reason why i loved the movie so much. Sure Whitney's acting could have been better but she managed to do a pretty decent job overall. As for the soundtrack it's a pure bliss for RnB lovers and i would say a classic now. The image of Black men in the movie is very negative but in a sens it pushed to be the exact opposite so it kinda shaped my vision and my life, and \"deepend\" my love of black women. Some parts of the movie are just so classic like the break up between Robin and troy on the balcony and the soundtrack at that moment was some kind of a symphony.. anyways great great movie .. enjoy Double Standard; So I finally got around to watching \"Waiting to Exhale\" on Encore the other night and I don't understand why this became a hit. (Note: spoilers ahead) As far as I can tell, the basic premise of this film is that all men are insensitive, callous and unfeeling; especially towards women. Okay, well and good. That is the storyline? Fine. Men suck, got it. But there is a huge double standard here; two of the women are dating married men and clearly, we are meant to be sympathetic about their plight as they whine and cry about not having \"their\" man with them at night in bed. How about this? STOP DATING MARRIED MEN! Maybe that's your problem in the first place. Now, on the flip side, Angela Basset's character is abandoned by her husband for another woman. Yet, if you pay attention, even this character is not completely innocent. When her husband informs her he is leaving, the things she says makes it clear she's known about his lover(s) for years but ignored his infidelities. Why? Obviously, because he's so wealthy. She liked all the \"stuff\" a little too much to have confronted him about it. Again, she's made her bed here, not as completely as the two who are actively cheating, but still. She spends the rest of the movie being so angry that he left her you never really grow to like her. Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer; he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar. With their clothes on, which apparently means it's oh-so-platonic and sweet. Then he writes her a letter months later, thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off, he'll contact her again. Did anyone else think this was more than a little sleazy? I would hope if I were dying of breast cancer that my husband wasn't out sleeping around (and I do mean just sleeping) with other women. Sweet, platonic, whatever; I think it's pretty horrible. Bottom line; the characters you're supposed to connect to are unlikable and the ones you're supposed to hate are just pathetic. Not very enjoyable. However, I did give it three stars for the music, which didn't suck too badly and the clothes and style. It's a nice little snapshot of how things looked in '95. And the print wasn't very faded. That's about it, though. Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life. Please. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation. A real disaster!; This movie is awful! The caracters are shallow and almost ridiculous, especially Lela Rochon. It's a very, very, very bad soap opera. I was watching this movie with my wife and we were laughing almost all the time. It is much too long, with no rhythm with absolutely no emotions. It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one cliché after another. Skip it, it's a waste of time! A One-Sided Celebration of African American Feminism; Directed by Forest Whitaker and adapted from a smash best selling novel by Terry McMillan, WAITING TO EXHALE is a glossy, but one-sided look at the relationship between four strong black women and the various men in their lives. The film is one-sided because the screenplay presents most of the male characters as sexist, manipulative pigs without a redeeming characteristic in sight, but the sensitive direction and outstanding performances keep the rather lopsided story watchable. Whitney Houston made an impressive film debut as Savannah, an ambitious television executive caught in a dead-end affair with a married man (Dennis Haysbert). Angela Basset does Oscar-worthy work as Bernadine, a woman who has spent her life being the best wife and mother she knows how to be, who has her world rocked when her wealthy husband (Michael Beach) calmly announces one night before a formal dinner party that he's in love with someone else and wants a divorce. The scene where Bernadine gathers all her husband's stuff and makes a bonfire out of it in her driveway is one of the film's highlights. Lela Rochon plays Robin, a not-too-bright doormat who finds herself pregnant by a man she wants nothing to do with. Loretta Devine is fun as Gloria, a hairdresser who is divorced from her husband, who it turns out was gay, and is struggling to raise her son (Donald Faison) and tries to begin a relationship with a new neighbor (Gregory Hines). If you can accept the fact that in the world of these four women, all men are pigs, then this film can be very entertaining but the top-notch performances by the cast cannot be overlooked. FAbuLOuS; Simply fabulous. I thought it was a great movie. I was completely empowered! It made me want to start my exes car on fire. Embrace your independence  watch this movie. (is great to watch with the scorned over glasses of wine and bon bons) It'll make you laugh, cry, get mad, and then plot getting even. I can waste a lot of your time telling you to see it, defending it from what others say about it, or just generally talking it up. But haven't you always wanted to see Angela Basset throw a fit? How bout cut her hair off? And who wouldn't want to watch Whitney act with humility. This is by far my favorite movie with Whitney - second, The Bodyguard - third, The Preachers Wife. Frustrating...; That's the word I'd use to describe the film, an adaptation of Terry McMillan's 1992 best-seller. It's not great, it's not bad, but it's frustrating to watch, and the fact that I'm of the male persuasion undoubtedly had something to do with it. Now, let me be the first to say that I did enjoy seeing a group of strong black women portrayed onscreen. To say that Hollywood has been exceedingly lax in this regard is an understatement. But it would've been nice if their collective talents hadn't been squandered on this disgustingly anti-male tirade. Especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine, who otherwise shine in everything their names are attached to. Good, solid movies about sisterhood are probably needed now more than ever, but not at the cost of shortchanging the good, upright, decent brothers out there, whom this movie largely forgets about (with some notable exceptions -- Gregory Hines, for example.) And the frustration doesn't end there. Both Savannah and Robin manage to find themselves involved with the most shady characters (a married man and a dope fiend, respectively), yet they complain about the lack of good men out there. I suppose it would be silly to question just where they've been looking, even though it might hold the answer. The sad thing is that there are fellas out there who have little to no regard for women (\"the scum of the f__king earth\", to quote Savannah), and women who fall for fellas like that for the most silly, shallow reasons. If it wasn't for Bassett, Devine, and Babyface's score, this movie would barely be watchable. As it is, it's a moderately entertaining diversion, albeit a frustrating one. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE HARD TRUTH) looked VERY beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts REALLY made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. I give this one 2 out of 10. Pathetic; This film is simply about a bunch of women who pick men who's behaviors they claim to hate & then spend the rest of their time complaining about them. It seems that this view is held by many women & possibly accounts in some measure to the number of women who consider their relationships with men to be unsatisfying. Decent; Those of you who ranted and raved about how horrible this film was really tickle my funny bone. I love to see miserable people hate a movie just because...well, they have nothing to better to do. Not saying this was the best movie I've ever seen. But I agree with others who say that Bassett and Levine are the ones to save this film from drowning with all the other horrible movies. I love Angela Bassett, I'm a huge fan of hers. The scene which depicts the morning after her husband leaves her for his secretary, which would've otherwise been too cliché for my taste had it not been for the way Bernie (Bassett) burned up that BMW! I mean that was classic. Sorry if any of you testosterone-fueled men out there will accuse me of man hating, but I love that scene and will watch it over and over again. Three cheers for Angie. And Devine's character, Gloria seems sort of weak and unable to stand up to even her teenage son, but I love how she bends a little and confesses how she feels to the late Gregory Hines' character. You'll notice Devine's Gloria and Bassett's Bernie are slightly juxtaposed but their chemistry is excellent. If you haven't seen it, check it out, if not for anything but the performance of these two gifted actors. Whitney ruined the great potential; Angela Basset was good as expected, but Whitney has no Range as an actress. The screenplay also neglected to portray, on film, the greatness of this novel.  Instead of promoting sisterhood, they emphasized the canine-qualities of men.  Read the book; rent Soul Food instead! Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this 1995 film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Hilarious in Parts; 1995 was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in 1995, the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection great touching story; While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life's mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great. WAITING TO EXHALE : Waiting To Go Somewhere, But Sadly It Never Does...; WAITING TO EXHALE Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. \"Waiting To Exhale\", Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book, had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it's star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene. \"Waiting To Exhale\" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone. It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn't know the word \"feelings\" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change. For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they've experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don't seem to learn squat. It's like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. \"Waiting To Exhale\" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose. ... D ... I wanna move to Arizona; I thought It was a great movie, although it is a lot of sleeping with other women husband that are taken, we all have to be honest, this goes on a lot in reality. it's not right, but it happens.... Overall I really enjoy the movie because it took me way back to 1995, the movie was great. great times, although I was just 11 when it came out, I remember all the hype over this movie from my mom n my aunts.... One factor that I've never notice before was the setting... It makes me wanna pack up my family an move to peaceful Arizona.. Great Movie. r.i.p. Whitney Houston I cannot believe it took me all this time to see this movie all the way through... Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... not bad; this movie and its story are quite good on the whole..........Ms Bassett is the leading and the best actress,for sure.I get her character.she's beautiful and I guess she's blown people away with her beauty and the EASE WITH WHICH SHE FASCINATES.Ms HOUSTON IS NOT TO NEGLECT NEITHER.She looks natural in this one.And despite her little experience as far as her actress career is concerned,she is good even though her story is a bit common .Loretta is divine!Anyways,this motion picture is merely good.There's nothing amazing.And it don't stand out from all the other movies.the only thing that makes me stick to the screen is the complicity and the crude humor on men of the four ladies! A bit too soapy but deserves respect for being a positive film for black women; Vannah is travelling to see her friend Bernie while leaving behind all her old live to start anew.  Bernie has just been left by her husband of 13 years for a white woman.  Robin wants to be loved and happy but always makes the wrong choices.  Glo has an estranged husband and the only man in her life is her teenage son.  The four get together through their struggles in love and live as they try to put it all together again. This is very much a woman's film and, as a man, it's easy for me to criticise it for being a weepy or for being a bit of a woman love in, so I won't.  The plot is pure soap opera, the lives and loves of our 4 women, however it is still involving as the four stories all have strengths as well as weaknesses.  The mix of comedy and sentiment is a bit too much 20:80 and at times the sentiment gets too much, but the sassy characters keep the interest. The soapy sentiment isn't helped by a poor soundtrack and poor use there of. In itself I like some of the love ballad r'n'b stuff  but here it felt like it was all over every scene.  This really bogs it down. Also a down side is the whole man hating thing  only a few come off looking good.  I thought the director being a man would help redress the balance but it seemed to have no effect. Why  can someone tell me  was Houston chosen to lead this talented black cast?  Was it because she could do a cut price soundtrack?  She's a poor actress and he spoiled her scenes  she needs to stay in TVM's.  Bassett however is powerful as ever and really steals every single scene she's in.  Devine adds comedy and sauce while Rochon is perfect as the vulnerable beauty going about love the wrong way.  The male cast is great too  there are so many well known faces in this with only two criticisms of them  1  everytime I see Haysbert now all I can think of is his 24 character.  And 2  Wesley Snipes' character just don't convince me at all. Overall to criticise this for being girly or sentimental is to miss the point.  It is actually good to see a film with so many good roles for black actresses.  It's a bit too soapy for my taste but it is funny and involving with a commanding Bassett.  Only Huston, a soppy soundtrack and constant man caricatures spoil it. The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Sticky; There was nothing in the movie that made me excited. The message did not come through,  if there was one. Perhaps it is to convey the idea that men are useless,  or that relations are complicated because women make it complicated. If a comedy,  I did not laugh.  If a drama,  I did not find it dramatic. It was like drinking a cup of coffee presented to you with way too much sugar. Good movie, Better book; This wasn't a bad movie. The acting was great (although Whitney Houston still seems mediocre). Some of the scenes were powerful and funny. However, unlike the book which also deals with the sisterhood of Black women, the movie becomes a long \"Men are pigs\" tirade that gets weary after a while. Plus it's sometimes hard to root for the characters. For instance, considering all the one-night stands Savannah has, it's hard to see why she's questioning her ability to find a good man. Overall, Waiting to Exhale, is basically a sorely-needed bonding movie for African-American women that, while a little biased, is good escapist fun. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about 15 or 16 and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker. 6 of 10 stars. This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Great female flick of the '90s!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track 6: This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! A 3 is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. Hot Soundtrack, Terrible Character Development; Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end.  It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.  However, much of this is wasted on poor character development.  Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover.  What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies.  While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all.  For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script.  Clearly the answer is that it isn't.  Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with.  Why the director didn't see this, I don't know. Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface. 4/10 Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. in response to your response; I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :)  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a 10, i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol \"Father 2\" : Born again.; Okay,now the sequel \"Father Of The Bride 2\",which was surprisingly better than expected. Like anyone who sees a sequel,you expect almost a carbon copy of the first. It does start similar to the first movie,with George sitting in a chair addressing us,the audience. It also does an unfortunate repeat of the fight between Annie & Bryan,again like the first movie,I saw it coming. The baby shower party is not played big,like the first after wedding party but I laughed when actual storks carrying little bundles showed up. I was kind of \"iffy\" on the sub-plot of George selling the house,having to leave in ten days and then blowing a bundle to get it back again. I'm not questioning the probability (we know in reality that'd be impossible),I just found it kind of unnecessary. I did however like his dyed hair and new look,that was hilarious and he should have kept it until the end of the movie. Some may say the idea of a mother & daughter being pregnant at the same time,is impossible. Yet,somehow it works here. It's not just the obvious next step for Annie but for George and his wife too,who thought having babies was way behind them. I love Steve Martin's warped expression when Bryan calls him a \"Grandfather\"! I liked that a woman having a baby in her 40's was taken very seriously,since it's a fact that women who have babies later in life have a more difficult time. It makes for a good piece of drama in a film that's otherwise a family comedy. The comedy is helped once again by the presence of Martin Short and I like that he becomes more involved with the family. Especially helping George out the front door on his back. This after giving him sleeping pills for rest. Once the babies are born and Bryan & Annie head to Boston for a new life,the film gets a very touching ending with George and his new baby girl. 8 out of 10 for the expected repeat of ideas,otherwise a very well made sequel. (END) A (Rare) Good Sequel; The first \"Father of the Bride\" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin's great comedic \"Dad\" character with the emotions of marrying off his \"only\" (to that point!) daughter. However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor. Thankfully, \"Father of the Bride II\" does not fall into this trap. With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather. Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton). Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women! Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments. Whereas the first film captured George's equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George's identity crisis. With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family. Overall, this film is just as good as the original. The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare. Let's just say that if a \"Grandfather of the Bride\" were in the works, I would be first in line. I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. Fantastic; Both the first movie and this sequel are fantastic. I loved the first movie, so I thought I would give the second one a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised!! The acting from all the characters is amazing, from Steve Martin to Diane Keaton to Kimberly Williams-Paisley. 16 years after its release this movie is still a gem. When I'm feeling down or just need a go-to comedy for a night in, these two movies are the best. For those who say that a 40-something woman is too old to have a baby--that's just not true. Do your research. I bet more people have been in that situation than you think. Anyway, this is a feel-good movie for some great laughs and a few happy tears! Average comedy sequel; There's been better, and there's been worse. \"Father of the Bride Part II\" falls right in between when it comes to sequels of comedies. The plot was easily predictable and the movie didn't have as many Steve Martin funny moments as the original. There were some good moments that made me laugh though, most being scenes with Martin Short. It did seem like sort of a stretch, though that all of the sudden \"Frank\" was an interior designer as well as a wedding/baby shower coordinator. I guess they just needed a way to keep him in the movie longer. I was hoping for a lot more when I rented this. My advice: stick to the original. Very Warm and Funny.; This movie is a very warm and funny family film. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the Sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny. The only thing I didn't like was Eugene Levy's character, I found that his part was just put there to extend the movie a bit. I also didn't like how they used him in the second one when he was clearly the one who auditioned to be the wedding singer in the first one. All in all this is a great family film where many will enjoy and watch together. Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! Not as good as the first, but still great fun.; In the sequel to the brilliant Father Of The Bride, Nina Banks and her daughter Annie are both pregnant and George Banks, being his usual nervous self has to learn to get used to the idea that he's going to be a father again AND a grandfather. The whole cast including, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams and Martin Short are all back here giving good performances. Even though Father Of The Bride Part II is not as good as the first Father Of The Bride, this is still a great movie which is enjoyable and fun all the way through and that's why I'm going to give this good sequel a 10/10.  Good, so long as you don't try to think too much; It was a fun movie, but it had no particular substance. I mostly watched it because I'd seen the first one. And because it was free on my cable. Or at least, I wasn't paying only to see it. Now, I have done that before and been pleasantly surprised, but this just wasn't one of those movies. Most of what was in this movie has been done already in the first film, and then it was in a much better way. Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, I'm just glad that I got to watch it free. Sure, Steve Martin's always fun to watch, particularly when he's acting dopey for whatever reason, but that didn't make it a great film. Just mediocre. Still, it's fun for a laugh. Funny Sequel; Geogre Banks is getting used to life without his precious daughter Anne. Now he is thinking about all the free time he will have when his son is out of the house.That`s when Anne announces that she is going to have a baby.Geogre is shocked but he becomes even more shocked when he finds out his wife is going to have baby as well.Now he has to deal Franck helping out with the two pregnant women.Can Geogre ever get a break? This is my second favorite movie.My first is Father of the bride part I.This is a good movie.See it it is a great sequel.It is almost as good as the first one. Steve Martin steals the screen. Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. As I understand it, there were accusations of anti-Arab stereotyping?; \"Father of the Bride II\" may seem to some people like a lesser Steve Martin movie, with him as the patriarch from the previous movie now having to deal with his daughter's and wife's pregnancies. Unpretentiously silly. But one interesting thing is that apparently, some Arab groups claimed that the movie was making anti-Arab stereotypes, as a Middle Eastern man buys their house with plans to demolish it. I wouldn't have interpreted that as anti-Arab; I mean, it's not like they're portraying him as a terrorist. Oh well, life goes on. The movie's a nice, goofy way to pass time. I really liked the scene where they bring Steve Martin into the hospital (that would've sure been an embarrassment!). Also starring Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, B.D. Wong and Eugene Levy. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. good, but a mistake; this movie rocks. but there is one thing weird. okay, so in the beginning Annie says, \"i have lived here since i was 5!\" and then later right when they are selling the house and playing basketball Annie and George(her dad) and her dad says \"i remember the first time we played out here, you were 4.\" wait...so was she 4 or 5 when they moved in??????????? other than that this movie makes me laugh, cry(because i laugh so much), and..........uh.....what was that other thing people say when they say that? i don't really remember. i just love how Steve martin always is so cheap. I am forced to say more so i will say i love that this movie is always on HBO! And i realized something, Steve martin has had white hair like forever! Entertaining, but the premise has been worn thin -- it's sweet, but unnecessary.; The original \"Father of the Bride\" with Spencer Tracey is a really good comedy, the remake starring Steve Martin is a good sweet-natured, amiable enough comedy - and I don't really think a sequel was necessary at all. I mean the whole premise is basically the same - before George Banks (Martin) had to grasp the reality of his daughter being married, and now he has to come to grips with the fact that she's having a baby. A nice twist on this is that his wife (played by Diane Keaton) is ALSO pregnant, but nevertheless it's still (basically) the same as the first film in one form or another. Thankfully it doesn't seem like a total cash-in (like so many sequels of this sort do) because it has a certain charm (as did the first film) and is still remarkably entertaining, all considered. But you can tell it was made solely because of the success of the first film - even Martin Short is back with another extended cameo as Franz the wedding manager. Of course you may be wondering why he's involved with a pregnancy, since his business is weddings. Here's a hint: more $$$ for the studio. Martin is basically doing the same thing he did in the first film - the weary upper-class guy who feels overwhelmed by the state of things. Diane Keaton is still very sweet and likable as his wife. The rest of the cast (including Macaulay's little brother Kieran Culkin) range from OK to good. Martin Short, however, is yet again a stand-out and is very funny - he wasn't necessary for the plot but he is funny and a good addition to the movie regardless. Overall I'd say this is one of those sequels that didn't need to be made, but could have been a lot worse. It's sweet, it's got some good lite-comedy moments, and in general it's just an enjoyable family movie that isn't trying to be anything other than simple entertainment -- which it is. Good, but first one was better; This film is good but you have to suspend disbelief quite a few times. All the performances are fine, with Steve Martin a scream again, and Diane Keaton glowing from start to finish (she has a lot more to do here than in FOTB1). The best scenes are: George trying to get buff in the gym, asking which famous men he's younger than, pointing to his wedding ring at the lady in the car next to him, and seeing all the misbehaving children out the window in his car while his wife sees all the happy kids and their parents out her window. And of course, when George holds his child and grandchild outside the delivery room. My favorite line: \"Now going to the movies will be economical: one child, two seniors, thanks!\" Good; This is well worth seeing. Everything goes perfectly. Ain't no such thing as too much Steve Martin, baby. Here Martin carries weak material, but it's a positive movie that shows the joy a new child brings. You will laugh, cry and cheer. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Some of the dialog is a bit lost on US audiences, but still some hilarious lines. The music is amazing throughout. Also the scenery is incredible. I saw the cast had a lot of great comedians, so I thought there would at least be a few laughs. Instead, I was surprised to see a very touching movie, absolutely great script. I give it 7 out of 10. What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the 1951 sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of 50. This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! The Best Movie of All Time; let me tell you.. anyone who does not like the movie is just a little close minded.. i read comments that thought the movie was too unrealistic but thats what makes it so great! i mean look at other movies such as lord of the rings or star wars neither or them contain true reality.. this is why its a movie. Anyway, i loved Steve martin in this movie. he does a magnificent job of playing the character for an over protective dramatic father. he was the best actor. who could have played the part of Nina as well as Diane Keaton. she makes the part of the mom annoyingly overwhelming mother, which is exactly what the point of us as the audience to think of her. martin short is the best of all \"fra'nk's\". the way he seeks George banks's approval is perfect. and lastly Kimberly Williams is the gorgeous daughter we are all expecting her to be.. i watch this movie every night before bed and i can recite every word to this movie. because of father of the bride II i have dreamed to meet Steve martin.. \"hes my hero!!\" hopefully you fall in love with it too. and dream to be pregnant with your mother as did Annie banks. My comments are going to be very positive.; Hi! I think that Father of the Bride Part 2 was a great film and very hilarious. I think that the mother and daughter could have been pregnant at the same time!  It was a great movie and I recommend it to all people who want a warm-your-heart comedy! It's a great film! Thanks! Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the 1951 movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the 1950 classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the 4 year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com I really found this film quite annoying; My basic opinion of this movie is that it is a crappy American feel good comedy. It is simply about a man who is going through another mid-life crisis as his daughter, who was married in the first movie, has a baby in this one. The catch is that his wife is also pregnant and with the irony really dripping, both of them have their babies within minutes of each other. As such the kid's auntie is exactly the same age as him (it won't happen to me, though it is possible). When I watch this movie I think to myself, this guy really doesn't have problems. There are people out there that have much more serious problems than he does. He admits to having a beautiful wife who loves him, owns his own home (or did), has a great job and great kids - and he thinks he has problems. Maybe the whole comedy is in the fact that he is worrying about absolutely nothing, but seriously, when I watch this movie, I simply shake my head and think that the guy is a loser. I really don't think it is all that funny. In fact, the guy has much more serious problems. He seems to be spending an awful lot of money, and is going to find himself in a huge amount of debt, and he doesn't seem to ever be at work. My question is not only where he gets his money, but where he gets the collateral for all of the purchases he is making. He buys back his house for an extra $100,000 on top of what he sold it for, and really, how can he seriously afford it. Okay, it wasn't all that bad. As a movie is was made well, and I did chuckle a few times. But in reality, this guy is a serious loser because he has more than anybody could possibly ask for, and he is worried about growing old. Hell, we all grow old, but he has experience more than what a lot of us have already had. Instead of worrying about growing old, the twit should look back on his life and be thankful for the blessings that God has already given him as opposed to forgetting all of that and winging about his age. like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $15k bonus to move out in 10 days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $100k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. Father of the Bride II; Likable, but not as impressive a follow up to the 1991 hit with Martin now dealing with his daughter being pregnant...And, oh yeah...his wife is pregnant again too. Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie. Touching even in its weak state.; Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, and kimberly Williams Paisley return in Father of the Bride Part 2. The film as a sequel was slightly disappointing, but on the whole, likeable. George and Nina Banks are in for the surprise of their lives when they find themselves middleaged and expecting their third child.  The timing is impeccable as Annie Banks-MAckenzie also realizes that she is expecting. Thus Steve MArtin embarks on a nine month journey that will consist of him building a new room for the baby, watching his daughter become a woman and overdosing on sleeping pills.  Honestly, the film made me laugh hysterically and i shed a few tears at the bittersweet ending. 3 and 1/2 stars out of five. not bad for a sequel; as sequels go,this is film isn't too bad.i didn't think ti was quite as good as the first one,but it's not a bad effort.i didn't find it as funny,and some of Steve Martin's histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me.really,this one doesn't quite have the same sincerity as the first.through much of this movie,i was all too aware i was watching a movie,whereas with firs tone,i was drawn in,and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting.having said that,there are some bright spots.for,one,this movie is just as touching as the first.and Eugene levy has a great cameo.and there is still some fun to be had.even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above,i still think Father of the Bride II is a 7/10 George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in 1995. It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. 2.5 out of 5 stars. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. I loved it, but one thing bothered me...; I enjoyed this movie: Diane Keaton is my favourite actress, Steve Martin always makes me laugh and Martin Short is great, but I felt really sorry for Keaton having to pretend to be pregnant. She didn't seem to be enjoying it and when the Banks were at the hospital, she actually looked rather bored, because whenever she spoke from the moment George protested about the doctor's name, she almost made it sound like she was in a maths lesson. Apart from that, it was great! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching Martin, Keaton or Short in a movie or who likes to laugh. 9/10 because of the little problem, but it was great. I loved it. Better than the original; This one is definitely better than the original, funnier, smoother pace, and in some places, better acting! Plus Martin Short has more screen time. Great! This is a great movie for anyone who like good clean comedy. Awesome! Five out of Five Moose Stars! Father of the Bride Part II; The first film was the remake of the original version starring Spencer Tracy and Dame Elizabeth Taylor, and it became very popular, so naturally they felt like a sequel was needed to continue the story. Basically George Banks (Golden Globe nominated Steve Martin) is getting used to the fact that his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) has become the bride now wife and got married to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), and more surprisingly a mother when she reveals she is pregnant. With this revelation comes out George has a small midlife crisis, and he tries to recapture his youth, including dying his hair, but he does eventually settle somewhat and get used to the idea that he will be a grandfather. But then he is shocked to find out he will be a father again as well when his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) reveals that she is also pregnant, and it may appear that both her and Annie's baby will be born on the same day. With these things happening, and the house having leaks and termites there is the opportunity to change things by selling the house to Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy), but he changes his mind later. When George manages to get the house back, despite a higher price, he gets the help of camp wedding planner/coordinator, now interior designer, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) to make the baby rooms and get things ready for the arrival of children. There are a couple of false alarms from Annie where she thinks the baby is coming, but eventually it comes to the real thing, and they rush to hospital, and of course Nina goes in to labour as well. In the end George is very happy to be holding both his new baby son and his new baby granddaughter is his arms, before his daughter and her husband move away to their own new home. Also starring Kieran Culkin as Matty Banks, B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein, Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie and Jane Adams as Dr. Megan Eisenberg. I can see what the critics mean by giving it two out of five stars in certain places, it certainly isn't as funny as the original film, it concentrates more on the sentimental material, but that's not a bad thing for this comedy drama. Okay! No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. AWESOME!; This movie is great!  I think it's one of the best movies ever made!  I love both Father of the Bride I and II!  I think that it is cute how they have the mother and daughter pregnant at the same time!  I hope that they come out with a Father of the Bride Part III, that would be awesome! :-) Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video Worthy second installment.; Mild SPOILERS are contained in the following comments. However, I believe everyone knows the story and how it turns out. The fun of the movie is seeing the actors, especially Martin. Steve Martin is back as George Banks, having just lost his daughter and basketball partner (Kimberly Williams as Annie ) to marriage, and now she is back home with her husband and a big announcement. She is pregnant. Of course everyone is happy, and the joy is doubled when Nina Banks (Diane Keaton as Annie's mom) finds out she is pregnant too. Poor George doesn't know if he can handle all this. After all, he is about to be a grandfather, he's not prepared to be a new father also. Martin Short is back as Franck Eggelhoffer, the unintelligible wedding planner. All ends well as both mom and daughter deliver their babies at the same time, in separate hospital rooms, so George has to go back and forth. The movie ends a few months later, and as Annie and her new baby are leaving, she gives dad a miniature basketball, a reminder to George that he can raise another basketball partner. Father of the Bride Part II; The 1991 Steve Martin comedy proved out to be popular enough to earn a sequel, much like the original Father of the Bride of 1950. All of the main cast of the first film returns in a story where the eponymous father George Banks (Martin) has gotten over the stressful wedding of his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) and her fiancé Bryan (George Newbern). However, when she breaks the big news about her pregnancy to the family, the grandpa-to-be becomes anxious about getting older and starts proving his youthfulness in various ways, such as selling the family's beloved house to a greedy real estate developer Habib (Eugene Levy). Life has more in store for George and his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) though, as it soon turns out that Annie's is not the only pregnancy in the family. Again, the humour is best when it relies on Steve Martin's comical talent and charisma instead of craziness and exaggeration. Unfortunately, adhering to the rule of always making sequels bigger and louder, the writers have given more screen time to the unbelievably annoying wedding planner Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) whose noisy and flamboyant scenes are certainly the weakest parts of the whole movie. The fussy bumbling caused by the impending childbirths at the end is also rather annoying and unimaginative. I think the movie works best during the more subtle scenes, such as Martin making uncomfortable faces while hiding his nervousness or arguing about the baby's surname with the overjoyed family during a dinner. Besides the run-of-the-mill jokes, the movie also shamelessly wallows in impenetrable sentimentalism of the newborns' adorability. Especially the music is so unbelievably schmaltzy that it was really getting on my nerves while watching; can't the filmmakers just trust their material's appeal without burying it under a sweety-tweety sugar mountain? Nevertheless, despite the predictability of the plot and the not-so-hilarious jokes, George Banks is a very likable character and Steve Martin is at home in the role, so those who enjoyed the first movie will probably like this one too  the basic building blocks of the story have not been changed at all. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. This is my favorite movie; ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is my favorite movie.  I think it is funny, sweet, and truly touches the heart.  In the sequel to the previous, Father of the Bride, George Banks (Steve Martin) is finally getting over the fact that his beloved daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams)has gotten married.  But then she shocks him with the news that she is pregnant.  Everyone else is thrilled, but George is not.  He believes that he is too young to be a grandfather.  He tries to become young, but doesn't succeed.  Then, both he and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton) are shocked to find out that Nina is also pregnant.  George now thinks he is too old to be a father.  They have one other child other then Annie, Matty (Kieren Culkin.)  Through the chaotic turns of pregnancy, George learns to except the fact that his daughter has grown up and moved on, even though it is hard.  They also have to deal with Fronk (Martin Short,) the goofy wedding coordinator from the first movie, who is now designing the new baby's room.  They then discover that Annie has been given the opportunity to design a museaum in Boston, far away from their own, San Marino, California.  George now realizes that he will miss his daughter more then ever, but he learns to get along.  In the end, he enjoys being a grandfather to baby George, and a father again, to Megan, named after the doctor who delievered her.  In this funny and heartwarming sequel, everyone puts out fantastic performences once again.  Even though I very much enjoy Father of the Bride, I enjoy this much more. And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW2, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. Loved it!!; I thought the sequel to the first Father of the Bride just showed what a great chemistry Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, George Newbern, and Kieran Culkin, along with all the other supporting actors have together. I would actually love to see a Father of the Bride Part III and I usually hate more and more sequels. I really do enjoy this sequel and I think it is better than the first one. I would reccommend any and everyone seeing this movie (but not without seeing the first one). Not bad...but could have been better; The first time I saw Father of the Bride 2 I really liked it.  I still enjoy watching some parts of it but I thought some realistic parts in the movie were not necessary.  First of all, the mother and daughter pregnant together.  This could happen but probably when the mother is not older than 40.  Nina had to be at least 47.  Is it likely that the mother would be pregnant at that age? I don't think so.  Secondly, I could not understand why George and Nina wanted the baby to have two last names.  Children always go by their father's last name and I thought Brian's father made a good observation when he said that George and Nina already had Matt to carry on the Banks name.  So why they thought the baby should have two last names is beyond me.  In conclusion, Father of the Bride 2 is still cute and fun to watch in some parts but I thought the first one was much better Heartwarming & Hilarious; Steve Martin does it again in this touching and funny sequel to 1991's Father Of The Bride the rest of the cast returns in a new story dealing with the joys of parenthood. I loved Father Of The Bride II not only because it was funny, mostly it was due to the comic antics of a man dealing with two pregnancies at once. He's a great comedian as well as an on screen father, my favorite scene is when both babies arrive at the same time. A year has passed since George Banks (Martin) watched his only daughter Annie (Williams) get married and has accepted her transformation from daughter to wife. She comes home with her husband Brian (Newbern) to announce the wonderful news to her parents, brother Matty (Culkin) and in-laws that she's pregnant. Everyone is thrilled and excited except for George who thinks he's too young to be a grandpa, from then on he tries to act young by dying his hair and exercising. But things are about to get a little crazy when his loving wife Nina (Keaton)discovers she's pregnant too now George must deal with the impending arrival of both his grandchild and his own child. Thrown into the chaos is Franck Eggelhoffer (Short) the wedding coordinator who helps to design a room for the new addition to the Banks family. This movie is not only sweet but it's charming entertainment for fans of all ages. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. 5/10 A really likable comedy.; I enjoyed this film. I found that it was easy to relate to Steve Martin's character George Banks as a parent. The relationship between him and his daughter Annie, played by Kimberly Williams, was an honest father daughter relationship. I recommend this one for parents in general and empty nesters in particular. The idea of a mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time is plausible and amusing. A Well-Done Sequel!; A sequel to immensely likable Father of the Bride, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is A Well-Done Sequel! Its enjoyable as well as emotional! 'Father of the Bride Part II' Synopsis: George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. 'Father of the Bride Part II' is worthy sequel of a wonderful prequel. The characters still appeal, the humor works & the emotional moments are heartfelt as well. Nancy Meyers & Charles Shyer's Screenplay is genuinely well-done. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography & Editing are fair. Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains. On the whole, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is a satisfying sequel. Some of Martin's best work!; First, this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2. If run back to back, they run like one beautiful story. This production is great from start to finish. Everything about it is wonderful, including the story, the acting performances and the direction. This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor. His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances. He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man. This movie is no exception. His performance is comedic, yet startlingly genuine. Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's. I love this movie. I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character; with how he feels, and what he's going through. This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum, and I love it. It's less about family, and more about life's curves; the every-day things that make us crazy, happy, sad, and ultimately stronger. It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think, consider, ponder the events which have led us to where we are now. Combined, they rate 8.6/10 from... the Fiend :. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late '40's)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... daughter gets married; In the sequel to Father of the Bride we have the daughter getting married and moving away from home, this presents a big dilemma to the father played of course by Steve Martin. Maybe not quite as funny as the first one,, or as good,, but definitely above average,, it's always a pleasure watching Steve Martin work at his craft. The movie is basically about how the family,, especially the parents deal with their young daughter growing up,, getting married, and eventually moving away from the nest.. the cameo from Eugene Levy is just wonderful,, as a real estate agent who is trying to sell the very home where our main character lives.. all in all a very family friendly movie,, that I would recommend. Not as good as the first, but good family fun; This movie is as thin as you can get. Its' emotions are easily played. There are no surprises. It is very predictable. And I say...so what? What is wrong with that? This is an American Dream movie. Everything goes perfectly and everyone is as happy as can be. Why should it be a complicated character study? It deals with the birth of babies. There's no complex feelings that need to be dealt with in this situation. A life is being created. A family is being blessed. A baby's birth is a time for love and hope. This movie has both in spades. It's a very positive movie that shows the joy a new baby brings. Every parent-to-be should watch it. A child's birth is an emotional event with no equal. This movie knows it and milks it for all its' worth. My only complaint is it should have been called Parents of the Bride. Way too much time is spent with the relationship between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. There should have been more attention paid to Kimberly Williams. Not only were the scenes between her and Martin the best scenes in this and the original, but Kimberly Williams is the most beautiful actress to come out of Hollywood in many years. Forget all the blond, silicone filled, bimbos that every teenage boy raves about. Ms. Williams is a natural beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****. Like Cliches?; ...That weren't even funny the first time? I've seen a lot of films with Steve Martin in them, and they all made me laugh.  Until this one. Part one is worth a look..it may make you laugh a couple of times (I think I laughed once).  But I recommend avoiding this one all together. Deja Vu; I found this sequel to be both charming and entertaining. What I learned tonight is that this movie is actually a remake of the 1951 movie \"Father's Little Dividend\", which in turn was the sequel to the original \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and with the same great cast: Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Bennett, et al.  They both share the same broad comedy and story line (only one pregnancy in the earlier version though), and in their own ways are equally entertaining.  Old or new incarnations, however, be sure to see parts one and two in sequence. Not exactly the most innovative of films, but still great fun!; This is an excellent, funny, warming film. Although a lot of the \"same kind of thing\" was done in the first movie, it's still entertaining. Steve Martin's character was good, although at times his behaviour is quite pathetic and Martin Short is again entertaining. (Particularly his pronunciation of the word 'pregnant).' Although it's highly predictable and not the most intellectually stimulating of films it is still well worth watching and the vast majority of people would enjoy this film. Not bad, but inferior to the first; I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the first movie. It was not without sentiment and it was hardly original, but it was still beautifully filmed, well acted, charming and funny. This sequel is not as good as the first I agree, but I still quite enjoyed it. The story is predictable, and there are some so-so parts in the script. Eugene Levy, who I do like by the way, is okay here but his character felt somewhat unnecessary and felt like he was there as an additional character and to give the film a longer length. And I also would have liked to have seen more of Kimberley Williams, she is so beautiful and quite a good actress, but I actually do agree that a little too much time is spent between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. However, it is beautifully filmed, has a nice soundtrack, decent pacing and good direction. And the acting is fine too, Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are still very likable, and while as I've said I would have liked to have seen more of her Kimberley Williams was lovely. And I loved Martin Short here too, he was one of the main merits of the first film, so to see him in his wonderfully fluffy turn again was a very nice surprise. Overall, not bad at all, could have been better, but I liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox A so so sequel; 'Father of the bride' was a good film and probably didn't need a sequel. But this is Hollywood, everything needs a sequel. While it is clear that a lot of effort has gone into making this sequel work, the central idea stretches credibility and every idea the writer had seems to have been thrown at the wall in a desperate attempt to get laughs. There are moments that remind you of the heart and humour that the preceding film had, but it's a load of nothing really. I went into this film dubious about how good it could be, and I didn't finish watching it any more convinced that the original needed a sequel. Pretty much just a rehash of the first; As this movie started, it reminded me a lot of the first. Various scenes were reenacted, only a little wackier, sort of like it was trying to be a shade more funny than the first; I guess that is the usual stuff for this type of sequels, but I think it failed at that. Apart from that, the movie pretty much succeeds in being a good sequel to the first. The story is also somewhat reminiscent of the first one. All the same actors return as well, and they are pretty much the same, just a shade more wacky. The story is also told by Steve Martins character, George Banks, like in the first. Pretty much everything in the movie is a takeoff of the first; this doesn't make it bad though, if you liked the first, liked the characters, you'll want to see this too, if nothing else, to see the characters again. It is about as funny and as sentimental as the first was, and as enjoyable. Fans of the first one, or of Steve Martin will most likely enjoy at least some part of it, as this is the typical for both the first movie and Steve Martin. 7/10 Better than the first one!; I love Steve Martin, but I was disappointed by the first movie, so I wasn't expecting as much from this one.  But to my surprise, this one was even better! It's constantly funny, just like one should expect from Steve Martin; it's not preoccupied with corny emotion, like the first movie was. It's Steve Martin in his best performance since \"My Blue Heaven.\" Sometimes sequels can be surprisingly good.  This one is better.  It has all the comedic elements that were stagnant in the first movie.  It's everything the first movie should have been, and more!  "

       "      <td>Strange indeed.; Set in the US, but shot in New Zealand by an Australian, Strange Behaviour stars Dan Shor as teenager Pete Brady who unwisely volunteers as a test subject for an experimental drug, in order to raise some much-needed cash. What Pete doesn't know, however, is that the scientist who has developed the treatment is a few sandwiches short of a picnic, and is turning his human lab-rats into knife-wielding assassins. 'Strange' is a very fitting word for this early 80s movie, which opts to buck the trends of the daygratuitous gore and nudityto deliver a very unique horror experience. Although the basic premise of a mad scientist using human guinea pigs to carry out nefarious acts might be considered fairly routine material for the genre, this film proves to be far removed from other similarly themed fare, and totally unlike the mainstream horrors of the era: there is a small helping of nasty violence in Strange Behaviour, but it is director Michael Laughlin's distinctly offbeat style and the promise of much weirdness that has lead fans of cult/drive-in movies to seek out the film. An impromptu formation dance routine at a 50s themed party, set to the sound of Lou Christie's \"Lighting Strikes\"; a psycho bitch scientist (played by Fiona Lewis) who is handy with a syringe; a gratuitous toenail clipping scene; Jimmy Olsen from Superman in crap fancy dress; Louise Fletcher NOT playing an evil cow; a creepy kid in a rubber mask and a murderous fat girl: it's all very quirky, and yet, somehow, it worksat least until the lacklustre final act, which fails to keep the levels of lunacy sufficiently high, and which is capped by a very abrupt ending that sorely needs a clever twist or suitably bizarre revelation to round off things in a satisfactory manner. Credentials high, however this low-budget shocker never quite takes off...; Australian-New Zealand-US co-production about modern-day teenagers in a small town \"outside of Chicago\" who come under the influence of a nefarious scientific team conducting paid experiments in their laboratory-fortress; the resident chief of police, harboring a grudge against the government-funded operation since the mysterious death of his wife, investigates. Director Michael Laughlin, working from a thin script by Bill Condon and himself, is very apt at creating atmosphere and mood, and the tension which slowly develops rests entirely upon these attributes (the characters and dialogue being of little consequence). His handling is, at times, uncomfortably physical, yet the violent sequences are paced in a realistically awkward manner--as if in a tumultuous dream-state. Laughlin takes it all quite seriously, with no camp overtones, though he doesn't give his first-rate cast an opportunity to do any real acting (Louise Fletcher, speaking with a light, frivolous twang, is particularly frittered away). Still, the look of the picture, the music by Tangerine Dream, and some of the horrific images are unique and memorable. *1/2 from **** Overall quite a confusing entry; A string of strange deaths in a small-town lead the sheriff to a rather obscure mystery he was involved with years earlier that has resulted in several youths running rampage over the residents that may have a more ghastly ulterior motive. Not really too sure what to make of this one, as there's a lot to work with that really shines through. The initial part of the murder mystery is pretty decent with a couple fun and admittedly enjoyable stalking scenes that definitely give off a tense vibe from time-to-time, and the finale offers some pretty interesting revelations that are definitely unnerving, but the fact that the film is just so slow-going and dragged-out that it really loses a lot of it's steam just by dragging out the investigation and doing nothing with what should've been a tense scene beforehand. Add to that a low number of kills which result in a tame amount of blood, a lot of broad comedy that really isn't funny and shouldn't be in the movie and a far more complex plot that normal really doom this one significantly. Rated R: Language and Violence. One of the truly great, overlooked, horror movies of the last 22 years.; Chock full of haunting images, chilling murders, and good performances this slow, laconic but amazingly effective horror flick has stayed with me since I saw it when it was originally released.  The film is best in its portrayal of teen life in a small college town in the midwest (though it was shot in New Zealand).  Taking it's cue from there, the film moves along at a leisurely, but ultimately disquieting pace revealing that all is not so sleepy and calm in this rural environment. Co-written by Academy Award-winner Bill Condon (\"GODS AND MONSTERS\") the story shows remarkable intelligence and wit in the vein of some of the best Roman Polanski flicks (e.g. \"THE TENANT\" and \"REPULSION\"). Best if seen in the movie theater to appreciate it's glorious widescreen landscapes.  Wish this picture was out on DVD. Something funny is going on; This came out during the slasher boom around the early '80s, except \"Strange Behavior\" dodged the norm from the infamous films of the heyday such as \"Halloween,\" \"Friday the 13th\" and \"Prom Night,\" as there isn't one killer at large and the murderers aren't cold-blooded psychopaths with twisted pasts, even if their bizarre motivations make them act like maniacal blood fiends. The continually annoyed and stressed looking local Chief of Police--who never dons a traditional uniform as everything is usually hunky dory--must investigate these mysterious deaths. The strange part is the audience hardly ever witnesses the small town in the grip of fear. Some innocent gets sadistically killed and others go about their lives as if the grass is always greener on the other side with frivolous humor and their regular routines intact. This is the type of plot where there's an \"elephant in the room\" and only one man detects it, as this focuses on a connection between the Chief, experimenters at the local college and the Chief's late wife fitting right smack in the middle. The story thickens when the Chief's son opposes his stubborn father to make decisions as his own man but gets ensnared by the affiliation. \"Strange Behavior\" throws in some distractions to lighten the load from watching violence and blood, such as a subplot between the Chief's son and the newly met, easy-going, blond secretary, as well as the chipper step mother who wants to fill the role of late wife. This takes cues from \"Halloween\" type killings meets \"Altered States\"-esque mad science meets \"Bond\"-like villains meets small town TV mystery/sitcom/love connection. This had the makings to be an esteemed film, though the filmmaker's ambitions were aiming sky high in an attempt to appease a viewer with scenes of the surreal and macabre, as well as the person who wants established, down-to-earth characters, though both sides bump heads to compete and this hardly feels steadily creepy or like it could actually happen as it doesn't fully come together and keep one on the edge of their seat. Even a potential for one last scare wasn't capitalized on. This could have learned from the weirdness that \"Dead &amp; Buried\" had: to keep the atmosphere alive by feeding throughout. (Also submitted on http://fromblacktoredfilmreviews.blogspot.com/) A gripping, effective and stylish chiller!; I first saw this inventive and well-produced thriller in the mid-nineties via a full-screen Rhino Video cassette I bought--this is not a film that is easy to find in most video stores (I currently have it on DVD and, I must say, it is like a new film, immaculate and widescreen in all of its Panavision glory). Well, when I saw this deliciously tongue-in-cheek flick, I fell in love with it instantly. The direction by Michael Laughlin was tight and effective; Bill Condon's script was clever, funny and twisty; Louis Horvath's provocative and incredibly colorful cinematography was impressive; the Tangerine Dream score was stunning and dream-like; and, in the lead, Michael Murphy, towering and unforgettable, was both brilliantly subtle and medium cool, as well as intense and humanly believable. Along with fine supporting turns from Louis Fletcher, Fiona Lewis, Arthur Dignam, Scott Brady and Charles Lane, the whole film is quite satisfying. It's hard to describe this film in a few short, concise words, so I choose to say that \"Strange Behavior\" is like \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" meets \"Halloween\" meets \"Blue Velvet.\" It's an atmospheric, genre-busting, deliciously quirky slice of cinematic cleverness. A must for genuine horror film enthusiasts. 'Dead Kids' is dead good! One of my favourite horror movies of the late 70s/early 80s.; In the late 70s/early 80s during the Australian film \"renaissance\", when historical dramas like 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' and 'Gallipoli' were all the rage, a producer named Antony Ginnane attempted to go against the tide and get some thrillers and horror movies made Down Under. He dreamed of being Australia's Roger Corman. Sadly it wasn't to be but hats off to him for helping movies like 'Patrick', 'Thirst' and 'Turkey Shoot' get to the big screen! 'Dead Kids' (a.k.a. 'Strange Behavior') is another underrated movie from this period that he co-produced. This time Ginnane and friends went to New Zealand instead of Australia, something to do with union hiccups I believe. The movie was actually filmed in Auckland, but set in the US with a mostly American cast, including Dan Shor ('Wise Blood'), Michael Murphy ('Manhattan'), Louise Fletcher ('One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'), Marc McLure ('Superman'), and Dey Young ('Rock'n'Roll High School'). Also appearing were the British born Fiona Lewis ('The Fury') and Aussie character actor Arthur Dignam ('The Devil's Playground'), who plays the enigmatic Dr Le Sangel, a role originally intended for Klaus Kinski. As well as a great cast this movie is noteworthy because it was directed by Michael Laughlin, the producer of Monte Hellman's 70s road classic 'Two-Lane Blacktop', and co-written by Laughlin and Bill Condon, who went on the write and direct the excellent James Whale biopic 'Gods And Monsters'. There are two outstanding bits in 'Dead Kids' which anyone who watches it will never forget: the syringe-in-the-eyeball scene, and the party sequence with a bunch of kids dancing to the Lou Christie oldie \"Lightning Strikes\". Music buffs will also appreciate the score from Tangerine Dream, and Aussies will get a kick out of (briefly) hearing The Boys Next Door's post-punk classic \"Shivers\" on the soundtrack. 'Dead Kids' is one of the my favourite horror movies of the late 70s/early 80s, a golden age filled with some very inventive and original shockers e.g. 'Evil Dead', 'Phantasm', 'Dead &amp; Buried', 'Basket Case', to name a few. Eli Roth's super-hyped 'Cabin Fever' claimed to be inspired by some of these movies but totally missed the point in my opinion. Forget Roth, go for the real thing like this, which is both more entertaining AND scarier. \"I can't help you.  I don't have a gun\"; This takes place in a small mid-western town in Illinois (even though it was shot in New Zealand!). Police chief Jim Brady (Michael Murphy) has his hands full with a sudden rash of killings--someone is stabbing people to death and is targeting teenagers. His son Pete (Dan Shor) takes part in some experimental behavioral tests at the local university for some extra money. They're run by creepy Gwen Parkinson (Fiona Lewis) and might have something to do with the murders... This is far from perfect. The script is pretty silly with terrible dialogue; the film is grainy (even in a remastered print) with bad sound; Murphy is just terrible; Louise Fletcher is wasted and the direction and editing are off (to say the least). Still, this film works. It has some pretty good acting by Shor (who is first shown completely nude--back view only) and Dey Young and an excellent performance by Lewis. It has a creepy feel to it, has an excellent score by Tangerine Dream and has a few highlights (especially one particular murder sequence and a great sequence at a costume party where everybody dances to \"Lightning Strikes\"). Also it's pretty restrained in its use of blood and gore. This is no unsung masterpiece but a good solid thriller that deserves some recognition. Due to lousy distribution this disappeared but is available on video and DVD. Worth seeing. Trivia: The opening victim is writer Bill Condon. interesting and entertaining; dead kids is very well made and unusual addition to horror cinema. it is an australian/new zealend production, and was made with the intention to sell it to an american market. so you get a film that looks very much like an american film, is shot and crafted like an american film with american actors (who are often better than any australian actor that gets into this kind of film, neighbours and home and away are rarely good casting grounds) but the script has a definite australian feel to it. from the odd, sly humour, to the way it deals with the murders and the almost complete lack of morality in the film. not to say it is immoral, but themes of morality never come into it, which is not often seen in american horror. for the most part, it is wonderfully directed, one that has to be seen in widescreen to appreciate. however, the murders are somewhat lacklustre, they are directed with very little bite. it is obvious that the director has no idea of hot to show \"action\". most of the time it does not drastically effect the overall film as this is not a typical slasher film. in a few scenes however, this \"relaxed\" view of violence heightens the horror, such as the final murder and the \"human experiments\" carried out on the main character. as mentioned above, the script is quite interesting and entertaining. however, there is a 2 minute ending tacked on after the final showdown which drastically decreases the power of the film. while not being a classic, it is still one of the better and more interesting horror films of the 80s that deserves a far wider audience than it has recieved. Strange indeed!; Known most everywhere (outside the US) as DEAD KIDS, this is the film by which \"strange flicks\" are measured. To some extent, comparable to MY BLOODY VALENTINE in as much as what we have here is majorly weird goings-on in a small township. You would never pick that this was filmed in New Zealand - it LOOKS like a small Nebraska township with a Pontiac Le Mans, Thunderbird, Chevy and assorted 60's Yank tanks on view as well as your all-american college dudes. Only the dedicated viewer may pick up the cinematography and Tangerine Dream soundtrack as revealing its New Zealand ancestry - very reminiscent at times of BATTLE TRUCK! Actually in large part an Australian endeavour also - witness Arthur Dignam as Dr Weird-In-The -extreme! Agreed, as a slasher movie it doesn't cut it....as a thinking man's thriller it never rates. As an 80's time-capsule..its a winner (\"Friday the 13th\" vintage) What makes the film, is its very weirdness and the musical score from Tangerine Dream. Those shots of the car moving along the town's main drag are utterly cool and absorbing.  For some reason also the fancy dress party and the kids dancing to Lou Christie's great 60's hit, \"Lighting strikes,\" just hits a nerve somewhere down memory lane. Interesting also to see McClure as a zappy college student. Some of you may recall him as reporter-pup Jimmy Olsen in the four-part SUPERMAN series as well as SUPERGIRL Not great by a long shot but way left field enough to stake a claim to horror immortality. Experimenting on the younger generation.; Galesberg, Illinois is a sleepy, small town where brutally strange murders are occurring. Sheriff John Brady believes it has something to with some secret experiments being performed on the local teenagers by a collage's psych department led by Dr Gwen Parkinson. Also unknowingly to John, his son Pete has signed up to the program in the hope the money he earns off it, would go a long way for him getting into his preferred collage. Slashers hey. God love 'em! Well this was around the same time when the craze for it was huge in the horror genre. But that in mind, while I found the New Zealand/Australian co-production \"Dead Kids\" to follow the conventional methods and clichés. It still manages to hold its own within the sub-genre because of its quirky charm, realistic touch and overall edgy style that sets it apart from many rancid entries. There's something quite compelling about it all, even though the fractured story could have been far more fulfilling in its matter. Mainly it comes off because the sterling performances are very convincing in setting up their characters, the story's progression is unforeseeable with a unique premise (that could be lifted right out of those early horror 30's and 40's features of mad scientists) and Michael Laughlin's pastel direction has a freshly polish tinge about it that comes off very well in some superbly choreographed scenes that are stylishly unusual (loved the inspired party scene with Lou Christie's \"Lighting Strikes\"), unnervingly creepy (the scarecrow scene) or just plain suspenseful. If there's one downer to Laughlin's direction though, it's that the most of the imaginatively nasty death/or attack scenes are executed rather sloppily and can look silly. At least they were grisly and had some splatter to spare, but in the long run it wasn't trying to be pointlessly gory or wanting to up the body count. It's a moody atmosphere that slowly engages the viewer with its mysteriously offbeat vibe and nail biting jolts created from its wholesome reality. Streaming through the script is a welcome slice of humour that has the right sense towards its material. The production is that of low budget, but it doesn't show up prominently with many professional elements working in favour on the project. While the film is set in US, it was actually filmed in New Zealand with a mostly American cast. The picture-perfect setting authentically comes across and makes good of the atmosphere. Louis Horvath's wide scope Panavison cinematography is gorgeously framed with such hypnotic verve and the Tangerine Dream's effectively airy music score has that alienating awe to it. Australian producer Antony I. Ginnane backed this one and has some other great films under his belt that he managed to get the screen, like \"Turkey Shoot\", \"Patrick\", \"Harlequin\" and \"The Survivor\". Michael Laughlin would go on to direct \"Strange Invaders\" and screenwriter Bill Condon would be recognised for penning and directing \"Gods and Monsters (1998)\". Though, he first kicked of his flair for direction with effectively minor southern Gothic shocker \"Sister, Sister (1987)\". The performances are particularly fine. Dan Shor is ideal as the Pete and Dey Young has a very appealing presence on screen. Michael Murphy holds it together with an admirably focused turn as sheriff Brady. Fiona Louis really eats it up as the icy Dr Parkinson. Making up the rest in bit parts are Marc McClure, Johnny Guitar, Charles Lane, Arthur Dignam and very warm-hearted Louise Fletcher. A definite oddity that works a treat in what it sets out to do. Recommended. Review from a kid of the 80's; The 80's is when I went to college and gained my independence. I also own alot of my movie watching experiences to the wonderful \"Z\" Channel which was a staple in Los Angeles when I moved out here. The \"Z\" Channel had the best films and the best way of showing them. I got to see \"Strange Behavior\" on \"Z\" Channel's yearly \"Halloween Fest\", a week long showing of films from all over the world. Not one digital/satellite/cable select movie channel today programs what \"Z\" had done on Halloween. They continue to show the same old standards \"movie\" when there are wacked out little films like this one that can be viewed as well. This is not a horror masterpiece by any standards but for the 80's it was low budget horror. The way I first saw it made it more interesting to see which is why it interested me and I liked it at the time. (By the way, I haven't seen it since!) It was gory more than scary and watching the experiments on these kids were something. Sometimes timing is everything and seeing this film on Halloween Night on the \"Z\" Channel in 1983 was pretty cool, even though by todays standards, this movie may be a dud. So I say, if you're an adult and want to add some \"different\" movies in your Halloween party fare, this might do the trick. Other than that, this film may seem really dated and cheap to you. A fascinating offbeat horror movie.; Don't let the unpleasant title put you off, this is an excellent little movie that I actually found quite scary. The acting is top class especially from Dan Shor and Michael Murphy who star. Louise Fletcher is also on top form and all three bring a realistic almost 'cinema veritie' feel to the proceedings. The film works because of Michael laughlins direction that develops the film on many levels. On the one hand there is lots of atmosphere and a suspenseful intensity that builds up to the films climax yet Laughlin also concentrates on character development and relationships giving us insights in to Chief Bradys (Michael Murphy) mysterious past and the close father/son relationship him and Pete (Dan Shor) have. The film also pays close attention to small town life. In this small Louisiana town everyone knows everyone there are lots of nice little touches by Laughlin to point this out. Laughlins direction also has a humorous edge to it and the good acting adds to this. There is one incredibly surreal scene in the movie at a party where all the 'party-goers' start dancing in unison! They are all in 50's style fancy dress and dance in a hyperbolic 50's fashion! Although it is hard to decipher Laughlins motives here this scene seems incredibly inspired to me personally. Although some scenes in this film are quite shocking I cannot comment on the amount of gore in this film because I have only seen the UK 18 cert release which has been cut considerably and panned and scanned. If only there was a widescreen version available I for one would instantly snap it up! Strange Behavior (interesting plo - BAD MOVIE); I just got it on DVD because I read of all the positive hype, and loved movies like \"Stepford \"Wifes\", \"Desturbing Behavior\" and \"The Mansurain Candidate\", and I hoped to find more movies in this genre. I stumbled over this movie, and though I had found what I was looking for because of the good reviews and interesting plot, but I was really WRONG! First of all, this movie has a really slow pace! You can deal with that is the acting and the atmosphere is good, but none of these were good. There was just about no atmosphere at all, you never get a shock or feel scared or even interested in the characters. The Good: Kid with scare mask makes a kill. (Really great mask!) Nice filming while riding the car. (camera on backseat) Plot with potential The Bad: only 5 kills in the entire movie, and only one is interesting. No interest in the characters hardly any focus on the experiments/plot Lots of random talk, no continuation in the movie No atmosphere, you feel nothing but boredom while watching this movie Boring surroundings Boring sound side of the movie Conclusion: Not worth watching, even if your a horror fan. There is no reason for watching this movie, unless your a major fan of someone in it :-S Don't know who that should be! Could have been stranger ",
       " AND better.; Feel free to call me a sick and disturbed individual, but I have a weakness for horror movies in which the bloodthirsty murderers are young children and/or movies in which young kids are being killed off. So you can image, since one of the a.k.a title of this movie is \"Dead Kids\", I was very much intrigued and eager to trace it down. Browsing through the other user comments, it looks as if the film has quite a solid cult following and many fans even refer to it as a genuinely underrated and neglected gem of early 80's horror. Personally, I wouldn't go so far and call it that, but it definitely is a worthwhile sleeper, featuring several moments of effective creepiness, an overall sinister atmosphere and a handful of delightfully insane characters. Actually, the only thing that keeps me from rating \"Strange Behavior\" as a neglected gem myself is the rather mundane and unoriginal plot as well as the disappointing amount of explicit gore. The script  courtesy of Bill Condon (\"Gods and Monsters\")  contains a few ingenious ideas and neat touches, but it generally is a run-of-the-mill shocker about a mad scientist whose behaviorist experiments are causing the youthful guinea pigs to turn into sadistic &amp; unaware murderers. \"Strange Behavior\" is set in a quiet little town near Chicago (although filmed in New Zealand), where four young citizens are brutally killed within a short period of time. The police remain clueless regarding the identity &amp; motivation of the culprit(s), until inspector John Brady discovers that the local psychiatric center pays students in exchange for experimenting on them. Brady had unpleasant encounters with the eerie Dr. Le Sange in the past  and assumed he was dead  but the nightmare starts all over again, especially when his own son appears to be involved in the experiments. The finale is a tad bit predictable and déjà-vu, but the earlier killing sequences are extremely well staged and macabre. There also is an unforgettably unsettling syringe-in-the-eyeball sequence that made me feel uncomfortable for a second. Definitely the best shot in its type, along with the similar moment in  and that's a true gem  \"Dead &amp; Buried\". The soundtrack is quite awesome and there's even room for a slight bit of black humor, provided by Charles Lane as the elderly cop. When the authorities finally receive a lead stating that a mildly obese young girl committed one of the murders, he goes to the local high school in order to collect the files of all the female students. When asked what they're for, he cheerfully replies: \"We're gonna find the fat ones!\" Priceless",
       " \"Strange Behavior\" is a fun horror film that does deserve a little more appreciation, but the basic plot surely had more potential. Nonetheless, it's worth checking out. Better than expected, but...; FINALLY, a passable horror. Although, I'll remember it more for a stunning I Dream Of Jeannie costume in the fancy dress party scene, than for the actual content. Also, I have no idea why this is rated 18 since the murders are more comical than gruesome, and the most horrific thing on displays are the bad 80's hairdos. Still, Fiona Lewis's performance as the most ruthless female medical worker since Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is noteworthy (Oddly enough, the woman who played Nurse Ratched, Louise Fletcher, pops up here in a completely different role) and there is a nice little twist near the end. Alas, the unrealistic stabbings and the presence of breathing corpses prevent it from ever being scary, and the tactic of renaming it DEAD KIDS in the UK just reeks of desperation.It's perfectly watchable,and miles better than some of the dross I've seen of this genre recently, but my wait for a truly good horror this year goes on Not bad, but not very good.; SB is definitely not a reminder of the teen slasher/slasher runs loose at camp/sorority house serial killer films of the 80s. The violence is quite mild (with the possible exception of a certain bathroom scene), there's no mystery about who the killer is or why they're killing, and there's no gratuitous nudity. (In fact, I don't recall any nudity at all.) The plot, which revolves around the ability of mad scientist types to remotely control the behavior of teens and to make them commit murder, is hackneyed and dated even by the standards of the early 80s. The viewer is let in on the plot fairly early in the film. Combined with the low overall body count (and some inexplicable gaps in the storyline,) the film can be both boring and puzzling. Several well-known actors put in obligatory roles, but only Louise Fletcher seems embarrassed by her marginal and insignificant character. Fiona Lewis plays...well, Fiona Lewis. Charles Lane appears in the movie, but we're never sure exactly why. Dan Shor is a somewhat odd and inappropriate choice as the teen lead. He was 25 when the movie was made and while this is not uncommon in casting teens, he is not able to pull it off. Besides being a couple inches shorter than the romantic interest, he walks around like a zombie BEFORE he's zombified and his face makes him look like he's just come off a three-day bender. From the right angle, he'll remind you of William Katt, but with none of Katt's charm or boyish sense of humor. One distinctive touch to this movie is the odd little scene that serves as a coda. The scene does not really serve any purpose...there are no revelations...no suggestions that \"the evil\" will return...no surprises or shocks...no final resolution of the fate of Fiona Lewis's character. It's just filler stuck on the end. In spite of all the film's flaws, it is fairly well-made and the NZ scenery does stand in well for Illinois. Overall, it's quite competent, just not memorable. Strictly for those who enjoy such movies, as there is little else to recommend it other than the genre. A sadly overlooked sci-fi slasher (See This Slasher #4); A couple of teens looking to grab a few extra bucks sign up to be experimented on by the scientists at the local university. Unfortunately, something strange is going on that will cost the lives of more than a few of the town's teens: The experiments are causing them to turn into violent killers! Though it starts out a bit shaky with one of the least thrilling death scenes ever, Strange Behavior quickly becomes one of the most entertaining and enjoyable slashers I've ever seen. Using a great blend of comedy and horror, Michael Laughlin creates a film that is quite tragically forgotten or overlooked when consulting the huge library of late 70s/early 80s horrors. There isn't much to complain about since almost everything is done surprisingly well. The writing &amp; direction work very well, which results in a film that works on several different levels: horror, sci-fi, thriller, and comedy. The acting is pretty good for a teen film, not over-the-top or cheesy like one would expect, but still not great. There are a few good songs on the soundtrack from Lou Christie and Pop Mechanix. The conclusion is cool and a bit unexpected, though it seemed rather rushed. But, it all comes together to be a very, very watchable slasher. In the end, if this film sounds like it would be enjoyable. . . you will find it enjoyable. It's the kind of movie that was made for one thing: entertainment, and it succeeds. I'll now be checking in on the second installment of the failed trilogy: Strange Invaders. Unfortunately, the third installment was never produced. Never too late, Endeavour Productions (well, for you it is). *wink wink* Obligatory Slasher Elements: - Violence/Gore: Well, there isn't much violence (most of it is off-screen), but there's some good gore. The 'smaller' gore scenes are done well, but some of the more extravagant ones aren't so great. - Sex/Nudity: Sadly, no. - Cool Killer(s): Yes, very. Because the experiments cause the OTHERS to be killers, it made it far more interesting. - Scares/Suspense: There are some jump scares and some good tension (especially during the experiments), but it wasn't overly suspenseful. - Mystery: Yeah, there is. . . origins of the medical facility &amp; all that. - Awkward Dance Scene: There is a totally rockin' costume party complete with an Adam West-style Batman and a tuxedo t-shirt. . . and all the great choreographed 80s moves none of us want to remember. - Classic Quote of the Film: ''We're going to find the fat ones!\" Final verdict: 8/10. See this slasher! -AP3- Strange Behavior; From director Michael Laughlin(the underrated STRANGE INVADERS with Paul LeMat)and writer/producer Bill Condon(director of GODS AND MONSTERS), shot in New Zealand substituting a town in Illinois miles out of Chicago, comes this rather interesting mad-scientist \"killer college kids\" movie about how neurological experiments, which require volunteers(students wanting to make a couple hundred), could be linked to a series of sadistic knife stabbings; differing methods as to how they are performed leaves policeman John Brady(Michael Murphy;MANHATTAN)baffled to the point that he must call up Chicago for some assistance. Brady has a history with the scientist, Dr. Le Sangel(Arthur Dignam), whose work is the template used by Professor Gwen Parkinson(Fiona Lewis;DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN)in conducting her behavioral experiments which includes a certain type of drug, a pill called PRL-B58, which supposedly awakens a part of the brain we don't normally use. In fact this drug in actuality allows Parkinson(or someone else maybe)to puppet human guinea pigs into committing homicides. Brady's boy, Pete(Dan Shor), is Parkinson's latest victim and might be used to kill his dad. Brady's wife died he believes at the will of Le Sangel for leaving the scientist and his research project. Brady and Le Sangel become mortal enemies, although it's believed the scientist was killed. With Louise Fletcher as Barbara Moorehead, Brady's love interest, Dey Young(the snobby saleswoman who hurts Julia Roberts' feelings in PRETTY WOMAN)as Pete's girlfriend, and Marc McClure(Jimmy Olsen in the SUPERMAN movies)as Pete's pal who convinces him to be involved in Parkinson's seemingly innocent experiment for $200. The knife murders are quite potent including one scene where a mother finds her son in the bathroom, his hand sliced off, the murderer(a robotic girl absent any free will of her own)returning to not only finish the job on him but pursues her as well. I think the cinematography(by Louis Horvath)and hypnotic Tangerine Dream score boost this rather cold thriller. Great cast that really never quite rises above the material for some reason..maybe they didn't receive the proper motivation because the performances come off as stiff and unconvincing. Michael Murphy has certainly been better than he is here. One of the few instances where the filmmakers attempt to \"doll up\" Louise Fletcher. Eerie thriller that is disturbing and very graphic.; Experiments at a local lab are connected to a series of brutal murders in a small midwestern town.  Confusing but effective chiller, made on a low budget, has a cast of mostly unknowns, but it all comes together.  It does leave some uneasiness, and does offer some shocking scenes that, while not elaborate, are still pretty gory.  It is a very disturbing, surreal experience, with solid suspense and a good ending.  It feels like you're having a bad dream: a nightmarish place, faceless persons, creepy enough to want to get out of, but intriguing enough to want to stay and see what happens.  Strange indeed. \"We're going to find the FAT ones!\"; Definitely a film with its own personality, Strange Behavior can best be appreciated by those that remember when films didn't require fast editing to appease the short attention spans of MTV-weened young'ns. With lines like the one about the \"fat ones\" delivered by the great Charles Lane and a vision of a 1950s style small town set in the \"present\" (something director Michael Laughlin and writer Bill Condon again brought us in Strange Invaders), the film was a splendid hybrid of old fashioned Twilight Zone ambiance and the fun, then-fresh exuberance of New Wave music and sheer sense of FUN. To top off the great mix: a Tangerine Dream score. Mad Scientists, teens partying (but in the pre-MTV, pre-home computer kind of ways), mysterious killings, and....strange behavior! Oh, and the kind of impromptu group dance that was a heck of a lot more fun than the big dance scene in Footloose! Where else would a sudden dance sequence just seem to fit into a film -- the way Strange Behavior smoothly incorporates old-style thrills with humor and wit, having a bunch of teens break out into dance to the song \"Lightning Strikes\" doesn't seem so unusual, especially since the theme of the party was 1960s TV characters! Disguising the location of New Zealand as an Illinois town was quite a treat as well. The story could have easily been done a number of times: small midwestern town, teens used as behavioral science subjects, mysterious murders by different killers...but of course the collaboration of Laughlin and Condon assures us this is not going to be typical. the focus is not to scare you out of your wits, but to offer something more mysterious. Add to that a very great choice for the cast (including more seasoned actors the likes of Michael Murphy, Fiona Lewis, Louise Fletcher, Charles Lane and others, plus the ever-smoking Dey Young and Dan Shor bring a likable aspect as well without being pushy teens) and an eye for design, Strange Behavior rises far above the cookie-cutter horror (particularly slasher) films of that time, and even in the present. There are many master shots that go for lengthy takes, and those of us that care more for story and dialogue can savor what's going on. I wouldn't be surprised that younger audiences that are used to fast cuts and one-liners would find this film too slow (and then again youth that are smarter might embrace this as other films from over 20 years ago). The minimal bloodletting works just as well, and the needle-in-the-eye trick can still illicit a good squirm today just as it did in 1981. It's great to see that Strange Behavior has influenced other films: Fiona Lewis' hairdo inspired the one Sean Young had in Blade Runner, and it's obvious the lackluster film Disturbing Behavior from 1998 was, to put it kindly, \"inspired\" by Strange Behavior. Joe Dante even wanted Fiona Lewis for Innerspace based on her being seen in this film. Strange Behavior is a great reminder of how things were so much more based on literal creativity and storytelling. Nowadays, it's all about special effects done digitally and pushing soundtracks from bands or music styles no one's going to care about 10 years from now. Laughlin and Condon were smart enough to give us elements that remain to this day unique, memorable, and never wearing out their welcome. Sure, by today's standards the film may not seem so shocking, but having come from being a \"teen\" back in 1980, it was refreshing for its time and has well earned its cult status. Sure, even the songs in it are more cool than what's considered a hit these days! Thank goodness Elite Entertainment has released the DVD in the film's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1, which also gives that widescreen feel of the 1950s thrillers in which Strange Behavior resembles so well. It makes my life much more fulfilling knowing such gems as this one are being given the respect and care in their restoration. Ignore the lower IMDb rating that it has at this time (just over a 4), because I feel it's being given a low rating by those who are too familiar with recent \"shockers.\" The general reviews by the press were quite good for Strange Behavior back when it was released, and I for one feel that I do know a bit more about what quality is since I've experienced these kinds of films and their evolution up through to today's more slicker productions. It's also why you're hearing more references to older TV shows and songs in today's advertisements: they just don't make 'em like they used to, and there's just more distinction and personality in things from way back when! Or at least, some of them, since this film definitely was different from anything else when IT was released. Long live Strange Behavior! Hypnotic.; Not quite the underrated masterpiece other people are talking about, I'm afraid. It begins well enough, with an atmospheric, out-of-this-world Tangerine Dream score and hypnotically slow direction, but the story tips its hand too early; the basics (if not the particulars) of its plot become rather obvious to us well before they do to the characters. Still, this is above average for an early-80s horror film.    (**) Hidden Ozploitation Gem?; A scientist is experimenting with teenagers and turning them into murderers. Although this movie is supposed to be taking place in suburban Illinois (the home state of director Michael Laughlin), it is actually the first horror film shot in New Zealand. Not until many years later, with Peter Jackson, would such horror films (notably \"Bad Taste\") really showcase the New Zealand scenery. The cast is impressive, with the Oscar-winning Louise Fletcher (\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\") in a small role and a young Dan Shor (perhaps best known as Billy the Kid from \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\"). Shor makes a great leading man, and it is a shame he never seems to have risen above supporting actor. The song \"Lightnin' Strikes\" was included because the writer (Bill Condon) was a big fan, but it also happens to be very appropriate for a horror film with its imagery of a stormy night. Heck, it also makes for a great group dance (surprisingly). Condon, incidentally, became a director in the late 1980s, and went on to direct some huge successes, including two films in the \"Twilight\" series. Severin has released the film on Blu-ray under the alternate (and inferior) title \"Dead Kids\". The disc is packed full of special features, including multiple commentary tracks. Even those who have enjoyed this film many times will be able to find something new here. The dead don't come back and take revenge - they don't.; This video nasty, released as \"Human Experiments\" with 26 seconds cut in 1994, and also known as \"Dead Kids\" in the US was one of the 74 films banned in Britain. Now, some may be grossed out quickly by Michael Murphy clipping his toenails at the breakfast table, Yech! I assure you there are more hideous things awaiting. It has lots of exciting scenes like the knife in the head, blood and screams, more blood and more screams. What it didn't have, however, was anything that would make this something to ban. Those 26 seconds must have been horrendous. I did enjoy seeing Louise Fletcher in a good role. Lousy!!!; \"Dead Kids\" aka \"Strange Behavior\" is really lame movie without scares or invention.The cast is horrid and very unappealing,the special effects are truly awful and the film is incredibly boring.Why do a lot of people like this piece of scum is beyond me.Sure,the concept is original and creative,but it should be better revealed.In conclusion,don't bother with this one. How will you spend your 200 dollars?; Slasher fans will have fun with this offbeat thriller filmed in New Zealand. It boasts a score by Tangerine Dream which is only occasionally effective. Several of the actors either went on to have a considerable body of film work afterwards or they arrived on set with it already under their belts. This has something going for it that so many slashers of the time did not: an adequate director. Michael Laughlin isn't an amazing director, but he does know how to make the camera his and our friend. He doesn't just turn the camera on and have people walk around in front of the lens and die as so many other abominable pictures of the time tended to do. He used some unusual angles and had items and hands coming from off camera at odd times. There's plenty of creepy shots to go around. An Illinois(ahem) college has a psychology department where students are paid to go through several sessions of new experimentation with behaviors. And some strange behavior results, of course. A woman in a lab coat with \"librarian hair\" who went to the Rachel Ward/Kelly LeBrock school of acting sets up the experiments, following in the footsteps(ha) of a doctor who used to work for the college. Enter young Brady, who wouldn't mind making some extra scratch, and he signs up for the program. Along the way, we discover that the research performed is making the guinea pig students into killers who stalk and stab. Rather unusual slasher fare, but it's quite good. Some highlights include the hilarious old cruster Donovon, who \"will find the fat ones\" and some of the worst dancers you've ever seen but somehow it's still fun to watch them. Possibly because this has one of the most tubular like awesome homemade Batman(and Robin) costumes you're likely to find around. Oh yeah, they're dancing, too! You may be disappointed to learn that the female doctor neither gets naked or gets the blade for a butchering she richly deserves. The last scene seems to cut to the credits rather abruptly. I was trying to recall where I'd seen Brady before and afterwards saw that he'd been in Tron. He has a young Steve Guttenberg appeal. Recommended for the great camera work, bloody stabbings, and fairly good acting almost all the way around(something of a rarity for these sorts of films). One of the better Aussie offerings. Of note, an alternate title is \"Dead Kids.\" Now, really, isn't that just the best horror title around? Almost as appropriate as Strange Behavior for a title. Unsettling and disturbing horror film; Strange Behavior really is a strange film. It is haunting, disturbing and so easy to be drawn into even with it's faults. The acting is excellent by everyone. Even the young lead Dan Shor was talented enough to show a wide range of facial expressions that conveyed what he was feeling by the smallest expressions. Some of the gore is played out very slowly and is so very hard to watch. One scene is a man's worst nightmare in a way you may not think. But beyond the gore are the bizarre and odd scenes that sometimes come to an abrupt halt. My thinking is the editor didn't have as much to work with as he had hoped. Some scenes end hastily which adds to the mystery of what is going on. In contrast, many of the sets are bright white with a pearlescent or shiny surface, some pastel mixed in here and there in paint or neon. One thinks of the surface of candy or TV commercial cleanliness. Other scenes show the beauty of the unspoiled countryside, the lives of people here are simple and uncomplicated. And along comes horror, the result of some gruesome killings. It's hard to believe that this film has stayed under the radar so long. Horror fans will love this and hopefully more people will discover it. But, it isn't for everyone. Before Bill Cordon became an ultra-liberal quack; Someone or someones are turning kids into murderers It's up to a local homicide cop to figure out what's happening..Of course this being a Bill Cordon written film he has to throw some gayness in there. Here it's in the form of naked male ass. Bill of course would go onto writing and directing movies that Liberals love and if you criticize them you're labeled a \"homophobe\", \"Puritan\", \"Close-minded\", or any combination there of. Such crap as \"Gods and Monsters\" and the abysmal glorification of pedophilia and his return to the mad \"scientist\" motif that is \"Kinsey\" If Mr. Cordon only stuck to semi-enjoyable low-grade horror films like this and \"Strange Invaders\", I wouldn't have a bone to pick with him (no pun intended) My Grade:C+ DVD Extras: Commentary with Bill Condon, Dan Shor, and Dey Young; Isolated music score; 2 deleted scenes with optional commentary; Photo gallery; Filmographies; Theatrical Trailer; and Trailers for \"Dead Kids\" (This films original title), \"Patrick\", \"Thirst\", and \"Syngenor\" A few Inspired moments of Horror, but Dull &amp; Unbalanced; In a small town in Illinois, the local teenagers have found a new way to make after school cash. They have been volunteering as test subjects at the local University in the psychology department run by Dr. Gwen Parkinson (Lewis). Parkinson is secretly doing the work of Dr. Le Sange (Dignam) who is believed to be dead after the crazed doctor was caught doing mind experiments on the kids which resulted in the death of the wife of local sheriff John Brady (Murphy). John's son Pete (Shor) has now began to volunteer and starts showing psychotic tendencies. Also known as \"Strange Behavior\", this film was shot in New Zealand and passed off as Illinois. Essentially it's the mad scientist behind the evil in this unbalanced horror film. There are a few effective sequences like when a mind controlled girl chases an old woman through a house and when twisted Oliver (Marc McClure) puts on a Tor Johnson mask and stalks and slashes a girl at a party. Unfortunately there are plenty of dull moments spread throughout and both the action and actors seem bored. This movie flicks to life in a few flashes which makes it watchable but it just never catches any momentum and in the end is quite forgettable. Different horror film, but falls apart in the middle; The first half of this horror film, about strange experiments going on at a small campus, is very good. It was very effective thanks to a chilling score by Tangerine Dream and had some expert cinematography. It also had some big names in the cast. Michael Murphy (M*A*S*H), Louise Fletcher(One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest) and classic film actor Charles Lane. But then, maybe 3/4ths of the way through, it gets terrible. And it gets there quick. I think the scene that convinced me this movie was no longer good was the one where Michael Murphy's character is talking to Louise Fletcher's at the kitchen table. He talks about this evil scientist like he's some cartoon super villain. In fact, the plot to this whole movie becomes a ridiculous mad scientist/ revenge story like you would see in a Poverty Row production from the 30s or 40s, with hilariously campy lab scenes straight out of a bottom of the barrel James Bond flick. It loses all credibility here. It loses it's atmospheric feel , the blond kid acts like he's high for most of the rest of the film, and it has a climax that is very predictable and feels like it was thought up right on the spot. It also has one of the most pointless and confusing (to me anyway) \"last lines\" in movie history, and ends abruptly. I would also like to note that, unless I missed something, we never find out what happens to any of the kids that the mad doctor experiments on. (SPOILER) They just kill and disappear from the film altogether. So to me, it just seems like the filmmakers stopped caring halfway through. They don't even try to cover up this one kid's New Zealand accent (it's set in Illinois, but was shot in New Zealand.) This movie is included in the same set with \"Patrick\". It is marginally better than that film but alas, only marginally. Fresh Blood; In a small New Zealand (as Illinois) town, future acclaimed filmmaker Bill Condon (as Bryan Morgan) is stabbed in silhouette after his parents leave him home alone. Elsewhere, aging teenager Dan Shor (as Pete Brady) is having trouble persuading \"top cop\" father Michael Murphy (as John) to sponsor an application to Galesburg College. To raise money, Mr. Shor accompanies pal Marc McClure (as Oliver Myerhoff) to the college's psychology department, where the lads are paid $200 to volunteer for some supposedly harmless experiment. Administered by creepily sexy Fiona Lewis (as Gwen Parkinson), you can bet the experiment has something to do with the film's rising body count... \"Strange Behavior\" features some of the usual genre missteps, but they're interjected with freshness. The characters are introduced uniquely. Shor shows his cheeks, and Mr. Murphy clips his toenails at the breakfast table. Louise Fletcher (as Barbara Moorehead) is okay, but in a much smaller role than heralded. Best of all is a sixties TV costume party kicked off by Lou Christie's hit single \"Lightnin' Strikes\" (1966) and ending in what can be described as \"Uncle Fester\" stabbing \"Hoss Cartwright\" to death. The Tangerine Dream soundtrack is sweet. Director Michael Laughlin, working with Mr. Condon, nicely mixes fright with fun, and they neatly construct an unexpected plot twist. ****** Strange Behavior (10/16/81) Michael Laughlin ~ Dan Shor, Michael Murphy, Fiona Lewis, Louise Fletcher Quirky, oddly gripping low budget horror; Inventive horror yarn that transcends the usual slasher fare by mixing in an imaginative, sometimes scarily plausible plot with the usual nasty in-your-face violence that goes with the period. Filmed in New Zealand but set in America, the photography in this film is ruined by a hideous print and poor pan-and-scan job on the video version I saw, but that doesn't stop it being a tense and grisly exercise in terror that proves to be a lot stronger than other '80s horror fare. I know I always use it as a whipping boy, but the Friday the 13 series in comparison is sterile, comic book stuff. I really liked this film's plot of a science lab being the front of a brainwashing cult, which I believe hadn't been done elsewhere. Some scenes are packed with tension and the film as a whole is very suspenseful. The gore isn't overdone, but is still pretty strong stuff and used in a way to make you squirm (for example, in one scene a boy slashes open his own wrists - ouch!). The scene in which the maid discovers a girl sawing the arm off a corpse is particularly grisly. At the same time, there's a great final twist in the plot (the \"kill your father\" scene) which I have to say I didn't see coming, although some other moments are predictable. The acting as a whole is impressive, especially when you consider most of the cast are unknowns. Particularly affecting are Dan Shor as the brainwashed teen, Fiona Lewis as a despicably evil nurse and, most of all, Arthur Dignam (for trivia fans, he went on to play Ernest Thesiger in GODS AND MONSTERS) as the weird-looking, immortal scientist. Great stuff. While the film does have some lulls and seems overlong at even a fairly shot running time, it still manages to be quirky, unpredictable and on the occasion, intensely gripping. Strangeness and disquiet.; \"Strange Behavior\" is a bizarre slasher/mad scientist horror film with moody score by Tangerine Dream.John Brady,sheriff of the small town of Galseburg,investigates a series of incidents where teenagers have gone berserk and started killing people.At the same time Brady's son Pete tries seeks to earn money for university tuition by volunteering for a series of mind control experiments being run by Dr Gwen Parkinson at the university psychology department.\"Strange Behavior\" is the first horror film that was actually shot in New Zealand.The direction by Michael Laughlin is flat and there are some dull and lifeless moments.Still there are also some nasty shocks including particularly brutal throat stabbing committed by the masked killer at party.If you liked \"Strange Behavior\" check out \"Death Warmed Up\" with its almost identical plot.7 out of 10 The Best Scene in a Movie Ever?; Overall, Strange Behaviour is a fairly lame sci-fi/horror hybrid with seemingly ordinary kids making a few bucks at a research facility and turning out a little bit...wrong. There are a few decent shocks here and there, but mostly it seems like there's just something missing - like the filmmakers lost part of the script on the way to the shoot and just went with it. Cinematic ally, there's no real reason to watch it, but there's also no real reason not to. However, our hero goes to a party (for no reason) and it's a costume party (for no reason) and eventually everyone breaks out into a synchronized dance to Lou Christie's \"Lightning Strikes.\" That's quite possibly the greatest scene in a movie ever. Take some tests,to get some cash.; In the last few weeks I've been passed one or two (what looked like) low-budget horror DVDs.Im surprised to find out that this is the first film by writer Bill Condon.While it has some slight \"slasher\" parts that defined the 1980s horrors,thankfully this films doges most of these things (no sign of groups of \"dumb teens\"),and thought flawed,this is still a very good under-rated horror: The Plot: Pete Brody finds out that hes been offered a place at some top colleges (includeing the same one his dad,the head of police,John went to.)But he unable to afford the cost of going to them,Pete gets some advice from a friend,so he decides to go to an \"animal testing\" lab,and offers himself as a human guinipig.What Pete does not know is that his dad blames the death of his mother on the lab,and with killings starting to happened by teens who are on a \"weight loss\" pill made at the lab.So John decides to look deeper into the workings of the lab... View on the film: The score is by famous electronic band Tangerine Dream,who give a very good ambient score,and there's also song by before-he-went-solo Nick Caves band The Birthday Party.The screenplay by Bill condon,one of the things thew film looks at is animal testing,thought sadly Condon does not fully build on the very interesting issues,thought he thankfully does include some good horror scenes (the best one being in a mens toilet!)The odd thing is for some scenes it seems that someone has pressed \"mute\" on the sound-effects! Final view on the film: A good horror film,with a good cast,score and screenplay,thats sadly let down by the low budget. Authentic take-on the slasher formula; *Spoilers Small Town Massacre really pushes the limits for being classed as a traditional slasher movie. Most of the post-Halloween additions basically stuck with the lone-maniac stalks teenagers scenario; but Michael Laughlin's impressive opus includes multiple killers and a completely authentic conclusion to an engaging mystery. Despite those blatant discrepancies however, it still wouldn't seem right to class this amongst any other horror sub-category, as it does include many of the genre's prominent trappings. One of the assassins sports a white mask and you'll also find a shockingly large amount of cheese, which is no less than hilarious in places. The thing that really lifted this above many of its counterparts from the peak year of 1981, were the surprisingly strong performances from a refreshingly competent cast. Academy Award-winner Louise Fletcher and Michael Murphy lead respectively, while Dan Shor and Dey Young provide credible youthful support. It also boasts a great periodic soundtrack, which includes tracks from Tangerine Dream and Lou Christie (more on that later). Unfortunately, on the down side, the frame cropping for videotape transfer from the cinematic release is no less than abysmal in places. There are times throughout the movie when the actor's faces are completely cut from the screen, and one could be forgiven for initially believing that a cack-handed camera operator was at fault for the incompetent photography. The reality of the matter is that the leap from the silver screen to VCR certainly wasn't kind to Laughlin's spacious set-locations. I remember many years ago, when I was only knee-high to a hubcap, noticing this suggestive cover signalling for my inspection like a beacon in the foggy night sky at my local video store. After checking the plot synopsis and wondering what words such as 'mutilated' could possibly mean, I decided that one-day I would have to pluck up the courage to actually purchase it and find out for myself. Of course, those movies rarely - if ever - terrified me as much as I had expected them to, but I kept that same copy right up until this day, and was indeed intrigued to see if my glowing memories had served me as well as I'd hoped for. It opens with a youngster studying in his bedroom; his parents inform him that they're leaving, so he sparks-up a sly cigarette and turns on the radio (cue some cheesy eighties grooves, via the Pop Mechanics!). He's puffing away merrily, when all of a sudden; we're thrown into darkness, courtesy of a convenient power-cut. To solve the problem, the teen heads downstairs, picking up a handy candle en-route and sparking it up with a lighter. With the small amount of light that emerges from the flickering flame, he begins making hand shapes in the shadows; only soon we learn that he isn't going to be enjoying these creations on his own for much longer. Another silhouette appears, clenching a knife, and let me just state that those will be the last finger puppets that he'll be making for the foreseeable future. Next we learn that this isn't going to be a typical trip into whodunit's-ville, because we see the killer's face as he blows out the candle. Soon after we meet our central family of characters that will guide us through the story, - the Bradys (no not the Brady bunch, unfortunately!) John (Michael Murphy) is the local Sheriff, who's got some serious personal hygiene problems (well, would you cut your toenails at the kitchen table?). His son, Pete (Dan Shor) is an intelligent young student that's debating his educational future and deciding which college that he wants to attend in the fall. His dad wants him to leave the area and pursue his career options elsewhere, but Pete has decided to stay rooted in his hometown of Galesburg. His only problem is that he doesn't have enough money to submit his application, but thankfully his scrawny buddy Oliver, knows 'a fast and easy way to make money'. The local Hospital is paying 200 dollars a time, for student's participation in un-clarified medical experiments, which Ollie describes as two simple sessions. These scientists prove that they are well ahead of their game with a demonstration in which a dead professor manages to control the mind of a chicken to make it obey his every command. Ingenious stuff, I'm sure you'll agree. An extremely sadistic-looking nurse called Miss Parkinson controls the moneymaking experiments, and Pete makes an appointment to visit her the following day. The night before his date with the medic, Pete informs his mother in-law, Barbara (Louise Fletcher) that he's got a party to attend; a fancy dress gathering no less, - and oh what a memorable celebration it turns out to be. One beaming female describes it as 'an honour of independence', which I guess is one way of putting it. A more descriptive term though, would be a no holds barred romp of amazingly sidesplitting comedy that will have even the most sinister viewers holding their guts with paroxysms of laughter. The highlight is when the teens begin to boogie and we get a wonderfully daft sequence in which all the comically dressed revellers do a synchronised dance routine that looks like it has been borrowed from Grease, more than a slasher film. They start by doing the 'locomotive', before they take it in turns to jump in front of the camera and do the 'hokey-cokey' in quick succession (!) The song that invites this unforgettable sequence is no less than Lou Christie's classic sixties dancehall favourite, Lightening Strikes. Falsetto king, Christie was notable because he was one of the very few vocalists to emerge between the death of Buddy Holly and the Beatles' worldwide explosion as a teen idol, and sustain a strong career for a long time after. The musical months from1960 to 1963 are often referred to, as the 'lost years' because very few artists appeared around the time that were not crushed by the big-beat phenomenon that was launched by British bands such as The Rolling Stones and John Lennon and crew. There's nothing that I can remember ever witnessing that compares to watching Batman and Robin taking it in turns to boogie, and its moments like those, which make this film so decidedly enjoyable. Anyway, the fun doesn't last for too long, and soon we get back to more of what people were truly expecting, - the horror side of things. Cut to two youngsters that probably couldn't handle watching any more grooving, because their sides had almost split, so they've headed out to the peaceful serenity of a parked car, in an attempt to escape the hilarity. We sail into traditional territory when Lucy rebuffs Waldo's romantic advances, because she claims that she has to get home very soon and they should be leaving right about now. Once the budding lothario has learnt that he isn't going to get anywhere that particular night, they decide to split; only that might not be such an easy task, as the car seems to be firmly rooted in the mud. Waldo jumps out to push, telling the strumpet to gun it, only his problems don't end there. In fact, things get a whole lot worse or the unfortunate fella when he bumps into a masked maniac that stabs him in the throat with a large blade. Then we get a suspenseful chase through the woodland, as the psycho pursues the terrified female back to the party, making the effort to stab her in the ankle as he goes. His murderous intent is ruined when the partygoers hear her frantic screams, so the assassin decides to heel it from the scene very abruptly. Before he disappears into the pitch-black night, he removes his mask to reveal a face that we already know fairly well. And so the plot thickens... The following morning, John interviews many of the teenagers - including the killer -, but none of them has any recollection of the events that unfolded. He realises that he has a maniac roaming around the town, when Barbara discovers the mutilated body of the teen that was murdered in the opening scene, craftily disguised as a scarecrow (perhaps as a nod to Dark Night of the Scarecrow?). Meanwhile, Pete keeps his appointment with the enigmatic nurse, which amounts to not a lot more than him taking a strange pill that he says, 'makes him feel a little high'! Earning 100 dollars for getting stoned; that must be every student's dream! To add to his good-fortune, he pulls a stunning blonde receptionist (Dey Young) and the two go out for dinner, which results in the beginning of a microwave relationship. That night, another of the town's teenagers and a cranky cleaner are murdered in a fairly taught sequence that mimics Halloween's use of building fear from staging creepy occurrences in the background of the screen's focal point (a door opening slowly behind the unsuspecting soon-to-be victim etc.) Due to previous experience, John decides that he knows what is behind this sudden spate of murderous mania, and heads off to investigate, which results in a fairly shocking showdown and an unexpected twist in the story. Small Town Massacre has enough confidence in the strength of its truly shocking and fairly intelligent conclusion, not to ruin the rest of the movie with pointless false-scares and gratuitous gore. Although, saying that, there is at least one un-watchable scene, where Pete gets a four-inch syringe pushed into his eyeball, while strapped to a chair! It would be truly terrifying to viewers who have a strong phobia of medicinal needles, which is quite a common fear amongst non-diabetics. As I said before, this isn't really a traditional slasher movie, but it succeeds because it tries a refreshing alternate setting to a genre that was all ready beginning to grow tired, even that early on. Aside from the licensed tunes that may bring back fond memories for fans of nostalgia, we're also offered a neat acoustic guitar-based score that provides the film's accompaniment; and a more typical synthesizer lick for the moments of horror. Although this is supposed to be set in Illinois, Chicago (Halloween?), it was actually filmed in New Zealand, explaining some of the beautiful shots of scenery that break up the story. The cast offer a few genuinely credible performances and the characters that they portray are fairly approachable and above all likeable, so that you feel for their individual torments. Laughlin also manages to build suspense in places, especially towards the finale with the will-he won't-he cliffhanger. Sadly, the chopped screen does cause a few viewing problems, and it's clumsily edited to the point of aggravation in places. There are a few plot-holes that I can't really tell you about without including a spoiler; but overall, it's competently written and makes the most of the authentic ideas that it has on offer. The BBFC don't admit to cutting anything from the murders, although there were a couple of suspicious jumps, which were impossible to tell whether they were the fault of lazy editing or outside censorship intervention? All in all, I actually thoroughly enjoyed watching Small Town Massacre and certainly suggest that you hunt it out if you're a fan of slashers or tacky eighties horror. It's been OOP for quite a long while now, but you may be able to track down a copy under one of its four aliases, if you run a search with a video-finding agency. The fancy dress scene alone makes it worth a budget asking price, and it also boasts a few edge of your seat thrills that separate it from the influx of its more formulaic counterparts from '81. It certainly deserves a visit from people looking for a different take-on the genre One of the truly great, overlooked, horror movies of the last 22 years.; Chock full of haunting images, chilling murders, and good performances this slow, laconic but amazingly effective horror flick has stayed with me since I saw it when it was originally released.  The film is best in its portrayal of teen life in a small college town in the midwest (though it was shot in New Zealand).  Taking it's cue from there, the film moves along at a leisurely, but ultimately disquieting pace revealing that all is not so sleepy and calm in this rural environment. Co-written by Academy Award-winner Bill Condon (\"GODS AND MONSTERS\") the story shows remarkable intelligence and wit in the vein of some of the best Roman Polanski flicks (e.g. \"THE TENANT\" and \"REPULSION\"). Best if seen in the movie theater to appreciate it's glorious widescreen landscapes.  Wish this picture was out on DVD. Trippy eighties slasher; Strange Behaviour takes influence from the idea of drugs/mind control that other films have used previously and since; and wraps this around a story that sees college kids murdering people. This is actually a decent springboard for a horror flick, and while Strange Behaviour is not a complete dead loss; it's not as good as it could have been, and when it all comes down to it; what we really have here is little more than another eighties slasher. As mentioned, the plot focuses on drugs and mind control and begins with several people being murdered for unknown reasons and by unknown assailants. Police Chief Jim Brady begins looking into the crimes at around the same time that his son agrees to participate in some behaviour orientated tests (unbeknown to his father). The police officer remains clueless about the identity of the murderers and the motives for the killing, but it soon becomes apparent that the tests his son is participating in may have something to do with the shocking and random murder spree befalling the town. The film has a handful of good ideas and the trippy atmosphere (bolstered by a soundtrack courtesy of Tangerine Dream) is good too. However, it's also very derivative and descents into familiar territory all too quickly, which is a shame as more could have been made from the premise. Strange Behaviour is an eighties horror film, so I'm sure nobody will go in expecting anything resembling good acting; and it's a good job too because this film doesn't have any. The exception to this, however, is the performance from Louise Fletcher (previously in films such as The Fury and Tintorerra), which is actually quite good. There's some decent violence to enjoy at least and an eyeball syringing scene stands out in terms of the cringe factor. It all boils down to a decent if not particularly surprising ending, although it does at least wrap everything up. I wouldn't by any means call Strange Behaviour a great film, but it does at least provide an hour and a half of decent entertainment and there are many worse examples of eighties horror films.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Jack Ryan Is Back!; Harrison Ford is back as Jack Ryan, the star of the famous Tom Clancy novels, in this \"new\" adventure, Clear and Present Danger. When compared to Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games, this is probably the worst film. But, it still is a pretty good, tense film with some crafty action scenes. Philip Noyce's film is about how Jack Ryan moves up in the world since his boss is very ill. His first mission as CIA acting deputy director, is too stop the trafficking of drugs in Colombia quick and quietly. But there already may be a team there..... Harrison Ford is good as always in his role as Jack Ryan. I noticed that unlike Patriot Games, he seems reluctant to carry a gun. James Earl Jones is also really good and his performance made me connect with my emotions. Overall, this is a solid thriller which displayed some good action scenes. The story is nothing new as many movies these days focus on drug cartels. But if done right, it can still be good. I rate this film 8/10. Perfectly Clear and Present for 1994; Though I remember liking this when it opened in August of 1994 and more than Patriot Games but far under The Hunt for Red October and one climactic line (\"How DARE YOU, SIR!\"), I could not for the life of me recall anything else. That's probably not a good sign for a movie I thought I liked. The first half of this movie plays like a TV movie with a plot a seven year old could follow and the film really doesn't pick up until act 2. Luckily, by then we're invested and totally rooting for John/Jack Ryan. 21 years later and only my 2nd viewing in as many years, I believe it somewhat holds up. Not to mention and comparatively speaking, it blows the other Jack Ryan installments out of the water, with the exception of The Hunt for Red October. Patriot Games, The Sum of all Fears and Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit all wither to this film. Oh, and please, guys, five Ryan films, two good and the last one 21 years ago. No more trying. Just move on. An atrocity to a fine novel; Clancy should sue!; The book was great.  I realize that rarely does a movie cover a book well, but this was absolutely ridiculous!  Half the scenes in the movie were completely fabricated from the screenwriter's imagination, and bore no resemblance to the events portrayed in the book.  Furthermore, the casting was awful.  Willem DaFoe as Clark?  Give me a break!  DaFoe is a great actor, but horribly miscast here.  All in all, it was disgraceful.  Even as a stand-alone movie, it stunk. William Dafoe steals the film...Ford is not at his best...; Harrison Ford is rumored to have disliked playing Jack Ryan in 'Clear and Present Danger' (for whatever reasons, I don't know), so perhaps that's the reason William Dafoe (who obviously relishes his part as a deadly field operative) is able to steal the film. At any rate, it's a well-done action thriller, the kind that Tom Clancy does so well. And, yes, it matches the excitement of 'Patriot Games'. A standout is the ambush scene involving an FBI motorcade unexpectedly under crossfire in the crowded streets of Colombia. Not as convoluted a plotline as usual in these sort of stories, it still has some confusing bits of business involving the drug lords and shady Washington officials. Harrison Ford's fans may prefer him in his Indiana Jones guise, and here they have even more reason because his performance is sub-par. Although a bit too long with some slow moments in between the action, it's definitely worth your time. Indiana Jones: The CIA years; The 1990's saw the addition of orbital satellites, laser guided bombs, fibre optic cameras, night vision goggles, personal computers, state of the art hardware, and more overtly militaristic themes to the techno-thriller format. One of the best of these films, which tended to coincide with the first Gulf War and the fall of the Soviet Union, was \"Patriot Games\", directed by Phillip Noyce with a certain classiness. The plot is a generic revenge tale, but it takes place within a world that is genuinely interesting: CIA conferences, Pentagon back-rooms, high-tech gear, telephone calls from the president etc. Building on the work of political thriller directors like Costa Gavras, Pakula, Frankenheimer, John Schlesinger and Fred Zinnemann, and mainstream novelists like Michael Crichton and Frederick Forsyth in the 70s and Tom Clancy in the 80s, an entire vocabulary was being added to here. Beyond the classy direction and the cool gear on display (the film has 3 good action sequences  one involving a CIA raid viewed entirely through a spy satellite- a big deal back in 1992), \"Patriot Games\" is mildly interesting for a couple other reasons. This is another in a long line of movies in which Harrison Ford finds himself playing a meek everyman who bravely protect his family, and it's funny to see the film's scriptwriters struggling to be politically correct. They want IRA bad guys, but they don't actually want to offend the IRA, so they opt instead for an Irish bad guy who is \"too hardcore for even the IRA\". End result: writers able to serve up easy cartoon villains whilst also placating their conscience. More interesting is the way all these films popped up during the First Gulf War. Like an unconscious display of American prowess, in the form of super advanced technology and \"all seeing\" surveillance gear, \"Patriot Games\" might as well have been an advertisement for the military industrial complex and the long reaching arm of Uncle Sam. In terms of flaws, the film has two: at times the villains are pure cartoon and the film's ending features a silly action scene on a boat, hastily tacked on by nervous studio heads. A better director would have extended the action sequence in the house (the film's climax features a battle in a CIA safe house) and omitted the boat sequence entirely. Released 2 years before \"Patriot Games\", \"The Hunt For Red October\" trades Gulf War muscle flexing for post Cold War, pro Soviet/American bridge building. But though it pretends to be about the healed wounds between Russia and America, this is still a rather propagandistic flick, about a Russian submarine captain who seeks to defect to the glorious promise land of Uncle Sam. Here, like \"Patriot Games\", a techno-culturally superior America is filled with good leaders and upstanding generals, and Russians would be crazy not to come on over for a slice of \"freedom\". Still, the film was directed by John McTiernan (\"Die Hard\", \"Predator\", \"Die Hard 3\", \"Thomas Crown Affair\"  all good action flicks), so it has a certain style to it. Like \"Patriot Games\", once you get past some clichés and some clownishness, it's a rather serious picture with some nice hardware on display for the boys and some well mounted action scenes. Released in 1994, and again directed by Phillip Noyce, \"Clear and Present Danger\" is the most sophisticated of these films, which were all based on Tom Clancy novels (Clancy, a major tech-head, fantasises about World War 3 for a living). Here, the world isn't made up of good guys and bad guys and there are lots of conflicting, self interests. The villain here is also nothing less than the President of the United States, a gutsy move, though by now this \"paternal villain\" cliché is getting old (\"The Fugitive\", \"LA Confidential\", \"Monster's Inc\", \"Minority Report\" etc). Unusual for such films, \"Danger\" points out the immorality of affairs such as Irangate, doesn't salivate over the film's depiction of a secret war in South America (which Noyce links to Vietnam), considers (somewhat) the moral implications of violence, criticises snap emotive responses and deals with political betrayals and private agendas among both the President and his advisers. Where the film differs significantly from its 1970s predecessors, is it's total lack of impotency: the 90s spy-hero doesn't shy away from responsibility, and will go so far as to topple the Presidency to maintain the good of his country What's funny, though, is that the film treats its central idea (the President mounting an illegal covert war in Panama) as a shockingly evil thing. In the real world, despite the fact that the American President is not allowed to deploy or instigate any military actions without Congress first declaring war, he routinely does so. Iraq, Vietnam, Korea etc, not to mention countless CIA instigated coups in places like Haiti, Iran, Chile and Ecuador, were all illegal by the Constitution of the United States. The fact is, Congress is always sidestepped, most recently in the \"bank bailout package\" fiasco. This being Tom Clancy, the main attraction is once again the gear on display: laser guided bombs, F18 hornets, sniper's hidden in the grass, an RPG attack on a convoy etc. From here, many computer game franchises would spawn, and from there, a banalization of military technology. People used to go to these thrillers and marvel at the hardware, gasping at the inside looks offered of the Oval Office and Pentagon, but now such things are routine, countless TV shows (West Wing, 24, The Unit, JAG) and video games (why be wowed by the sniper on screen, when you can BE him online) diluting the spectacle that made these films popular in the 90s. 8/10 - With the down sizing of armies around the world, and all technology fetishized to the point of disaffection, the techno-thriller genre (itself a genre borne from war, see Lang's 1928 \"Spies\") looks like it's winding down again. Ford Brings Freshness In His Second Portrayal Of Jack Ryan.; Clear And Present Danger is a spy action thriller that is based on the novel of Tom Clancy of the same title.It features Harrison Ford in the title role as Jack Ryan with James Earl Jones,who portrays as Vice-Admiral James Greer together with supporting cast that includes Willem Dafoe,Miguel Sandoval,Belita Moreno and Joaquim de Almeida.it was directed by Philip Noyce,who also was at helm in other Jack Ryan films such as The Hunt For Red October and Patriot Games. The film's setting happens when Jack Ryan has been appointed as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) acting Deputy Director.He later discovers that he is being kept in the dark by some of his CIA colleagues in the agency about a covert war operation against the drug lords at Colombia.Later,it was also revealed that the President's wealthy friend is well-connected to the said Colombian drug cartel.When the national security adviser and the CIA deputy director were captured in Colombia,the President's men decided to abandon their force.In the end,it was up to Jack Ryan and another operative to rescue them on their won risking his career and life. This is the second time that Harrison Ford will portray Jack Ryan after Patriot Games and he brings earnestness and freshness to the role.Aside from that,it the story provides complex political intrigue,interesting plot and lots of tension that it is fun to sit through as it is exciting and entertaining from beginning to end.Despite some confusion that it may provide in the political ideologies and beliefs that the characters in it adhere to including the President,what stands out here though is the moral dilemma that Jack Ryan as it brings his humanistic side of saving lives in danger which could probably considered the overall theme of this action thriller. The better of Harrison's Jack Ryan films; While less believable than the book by having Jack involved in almost every plot point - in Tom Clancy's novel he only properly comes into the main story in the last third - it's a more satisfying experience all round than Patriot Games. Some patience is required as much of the first half is spent introducing new characters, setting up plot, etc. The investigation of a hit on a businessman and his family on a luxury yacht by a pair of hired muscle reveals connections with a Colombian drug cartel - the businessman was skimming money from them, and he and his family paid for it with their lives. The money skimmed is located, and the US government seizes it which angers the drug baron who was being scammed, Ernesto Escobedo. Escobedo's intel man, former Cuban DGI colonel Felix Cortez, sees an opportunity to seize power by having the US Ambassador, and the visiting FBI Director assassinated. Meanwhile, the CIA, without Ryan's knowledge, is running an illegal covert operation against the drug cartels, with covert troops deep in Colombia staging hit and run raids on drug factories, and secret airports used for aircraft smuggling drugs. The assassinations provoke the President into ordering things to be taken to a new lever. An aerial strike is ordered against a drug baron's mansion while he is meeting with several others, and attempts are made to pass it off as a car bombing by angry cartel members. But not only is Jack growing suspicious that his own country is doing something illegal, Cortez also is becoming alert to the fact the US government is running a secret operation in a supposedly friendly nation. When Cortez blackmails a senior US official into giving him the locations of the US troops in Colombia, Jack, with the help of a shadowy field agent called John Clark - Willem Dafoe - takes matters into his own hands. Convoluted to be sure, but a thoroughly intriguing political thriller, with great action sequences, particularly the RPG attack on the convoy in Bogota. The climactic rescue sequence is rather weak compared to the more epic version in the book, more akin to a 12-rated Rambo movie, but it works well in itself. The showdown with the President provides plenty of sparks - I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES - though the ending departs considerably from the book. Intelligent, yet Laborious at times; WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS \"Clear and Present Danger\" is the third translation of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series to the screen, and the second one starring Harrison Ford as the \"thinking-man's James Bond\".  Although a definite improvement over \"Patriot Games\", and on par with \"The Hunt for Red October\", the film contains serious points of lag.  The material in these drawn out sequences is interesting, but it molds the film into an average entry in either of two categories: either as a tepid action film, or an underdeveloped drama.  Holes aside, the film is engaging enough to wet the appetites of fans of either genre, and is an entertaining experience overall. Ford is the best Jack Ryan in my opinion, successfully conveying Ryan's intelligence as well as his vulnerability in dangerous situations.  Plus he is able to inject his trademark charm and snide humor into the role which gives the character a more down-to-earth character we can relate to.  Part of the problem with the movie is the lack of development of the rest of the characters.  Since the script is burdened with an array of important roles, their screen time is often marginalized.  For example, Willem Dafoe is given hardly any development prior to the climax of the film.  I respect Dafoe as an actor greatly, and found myself wishing that he would be involved in more of the film.  Anne Archer has the throwaway role as the wife of Jack Ryan, but James Earl Jones is able to shine as Admiral Greer, even though he's on the sidelines.  Some characters just don't fit, like the entire cabinet of political bigwigs who orchestrate the events of the movie.  Donald Moffat is ridiculous and an utter buffoon of a president, and Henry Czerny seems to be insidious for no reason.  Many of these holes in characters could have been remedied with another half hour of screen time. However, my last comment would have shifted the context of the movie to a full blown drama.  As much as Clancy's work is engaging, the movie cannot stand on its own without the promise of action.  The action scenes are well done and gripping at times, but they are merely peppered throughout the film.  Philip Noyce is able to create scenes of tension without using weapons, such as the well-done scene involving a computer battle between Ford and Czerny.  Overall, the film gives off an odor stemming from a lack of sustained tension, and the plot visibly loses steam at points. Ultimately, the main problem with \"Clear and Present Danger\" is the problem of defining what it \"clearly\" is as a movie.  But, if you're a fan of Clancy's work or are just looking for an entertaining movie, give this one a rent. One of the best of the 90's; Clear and present danger is a simply amazing combination of old school spy thriller and action movie rolled into one. The pace is simply intelligent and the film avoids clichés. We open with the Coast Guard tracking a boat that had strayed off course. After stopping, boarding, and arresting the \"pirates\" aboard the ship, they stumble upon a crime scene. The murder victim isn't just your average citizen, he is a friend of one of the most powerful men in the world, the president of the United States, played to a statesmen effect by Donald Moffett. Spurred by the need of revenge, the plot is planned by two white house staff members, James Cutter (played by legendary character actor Harris Yulin), and Robert Ritter (played by Henry Czerny, who plays the role with the perfect blend of ruthlessness and coldness) James Earl Jones reprises his role as Adm. Greer, and Harrison Ford the role of Jack Ryan, the straight edged hero who sees the world in right and wrong. Both are simply spectacular in the roles. The film also has a good amount of name actors in supporting roles, such as Benjamin Bratt, Ann Magnuson, Williem DeFoe, Thora Birch, Joaquim De Almeida (from Despardo fame), and the late Hope Lange. As the plot unfolds, Ryan is pulled into a world that he's not completely ready to handle. He seems completely shocked that such corruption can come from the White House. On the surface, you can somewhat identify with President Bennett's need for revenge. One his best friends, along with the man's wife, and young son and daughter, who brutally murdered and tossed overboard into the sea. However, the means to which he goes borderlines on the obsessive and dangerous. His actions may lead to the deaths of several drug dealers and their counterparts, but it also leads to the deaths of several women and young children. The underlining question becomes, does the person seeking revenge become just as evil as those they seek revenge on. As Ryan is pulled into this twisted world of revenge he finds himself pushed to his own boundaries. He's nearly killed in an assassination attempt. He's caught in the middle of a coupe between a drug lord and his underlings. And he soon learns that he is as much responsible for the deaths of US Troops as those who sent them on the mission. For once, his moral view of right and wrong has led to someone's death. I think the franchise dropped off without Harrison Ford in the role of Jack Ryan. He seemed to bring the most to the table. Simply put, he was more believable in the role then the other actors who've tackled the role. Of all the Jack Ryan films, I think Patriot Games and it's sequel, Clear and Present Danger remain the best in terms of storyline, character development, and overall direction. I think that some viewers will be left at the end, wondering what will happen to Ryan, as he's testifying at the end of the film about the activities that had taken place. FRom the open to the close, the movie pulls you in, and even at slightly over two hours, the film never overstays its welcome. 10 out of 10!!! Great book, rotten movie.; Every time I have seen Tom Clancy's novels adapted to screen, they have been atrocious.  Being a major fan of Clancy's novels, it seems as though whenever they are adapted to the big screen, the writers botch the whole process.  None of the novels that have been made into movies do the books any justice. A Lot More Good Than Bad; Harrison Ford returns as \"Jack Ryan,\" star of the very well-done \"Patriot Games,\" the film adaption off the best-selling Tom Clancy novels. Also returning are Anne Archer and James Earl Jones. THE BAD - This isn't as intense, especially in the first half hour, as Patriot Games and the ending was a little disappointing with a action-scene credibility problem. Once again - it's getting to be a tired Hollywood theme - top U.S. government officials, going all the way to the President, are corrupt people, liars not to be trusted. THE GOOD - It's nice to see Willem Dafoe finally play a good guy. The villains in here are deceptively interesting, actors such as Joaquim De Almeida, Harris Yulin and Henry Czerny and Miguel Sandoval - not big names but recognizable and good actors. The violence is not overdone in here and when the action does occur, the sound is terrific. The best action scene was shootout in the streets with snipers firing at cars below. The positives are far more than the negatives, making this a solid thriller. Jack Ryan returns against a new enemy, but an old plot...; Harrison Ford returns as Jack Ryan, a CIA operative who's boss becomes hospitalized at a time when the President of the United States has declared war on the Columbian drug cartels (again?) I saw this movie for the first time the other day.  I have seen \"The Hunt For Red October\" and \"The Sum of All Fears\" before, so I was familiar with Jack Ryan, but Ryan has moved up the ladder a little bit in this film and he finds himself in a twist to the plot: people are behind some of the illegal tactics while fighting the war against drugs that lead him to a place where he, for obvious reasons, reluctantly treads. This is a very good movie!  Willem Dafoe was his co-hort in the drug war and they find themselves together against the common enemy, but the trust is not felt between the two of them and the tension created is felt throughout the whole film!  Way to go, Tom Clancy! Truth needs a what?????????; Harrison Ford was a bad selection for this film, as many here have correctly pointed out. Equally revolting were the pretentious, often self-righteous references to Jack Ryan's \"honesty\". Example 1: \"truth needs a soldier\", the film's tagline. Or how about \"Jack, you see things in black and white.\"---\"Not black and white, right and wrong!!!!\" (groan). Or my personal favorite: \"That Ryan is such a boy scout.\" We get it, Jack doesn't lie, everyone else in Washington does. Now the combat scenes captured a bit more interest, but contained plenty of errors. The laser guided bomb dropped from a Navy fighter jet appeared way too fake (even though I didn't expect them to actually film a plane releasing munitions) and surely could have been improved. Also, wouldn't one expect the director of the FBI to have just a bit more security in a foreign country, particularly one as dangerous as Colombia, than three chevy trucks and two paltry motorbikes??? I won't go into the whole \"give me maps of their locations, cut off their communications\" bit, but even fiction has to recognize some boundaries of credibility. Two stars out of 4. Totally wonderful movie; Harrison Ford is the best.  He is one great actor and makes those Movies that he stars in unique and wonderful.  He puts so much of himself into his films that they could be nothing else.  Clear and Present Danger is full of action, good over evil and right prevailing.  The action is awesome, the storyline is up to date with current events and what is happening in the world today. Following up on The Hunt for Red October and going through to Patriot Games and The Sum of All Fears, the story of Jack and his uncommon belief in right vs wrong and that good should prevail is what makes this and the others such good movies. I own them all, I watch them over and over and never grow tired of them. An all-around good film; Harrison Ford returns to play Jack Ryan in good form. Clear and Present Danger was a good film with a good plot and is a worthy sequel of the previous Jack Ryan films. It was good, but Patriot Games was extremely good, and a little better. My Vote: 8 Your word is You; ***SPOILERS*** Spoting a yacht sailing erratically in the choppy waters off Florida the US Coast Guard has the boat boarded. On board they find that it's owner was murdered together along with his wife and two children by the group of Columbian drug traffickers who sea-jacked the craft. The man who together with his family that was murdered happened to be businessman Peter Hardin the Presdent of the United States Pres. Bennett, Donald Moffat, best friend. Outraged at what happened to his friend Pres. Bennett sets into motion a plan to get those who ordered Hardin and his family's murder with his top two advisor's Cutter &amp; Ritter, Harris Yulin &amp; Henry Czerny. To cover his and his advisor's behinds puts the now new CIA Deputy Director Jack Ryan, Harrison Ford, is put officially in charge. Ryan working together with the CIA comes up with the startling findings that Hardin, the presidents best friend, was a major money launder for the Cali Drug Cartel. Hardin using his business and banking expertise was skimming off the profits, that his bosses in the cartel needed to continue their operations, and that was the reason for his and his family's murder. Getting retired US Special Forces officer John Clark,Willen Defoe, to get a 12 man strike force to hit the Cali Cartel where it hurts, in it's drug processing operations,Ritter is going against Dept. director's Ryan's sworn testimony to the US Congress. Ryan testified that no US military personnel will be used to fight the Columbian drug dealers putting the unsuspecting Ryan in danger, if the operation is ever found out, of being indited for perjury, in him lying to the US Congress. As all these undercover dealings are going on the head of the Cali Cartel Ernesto Escobedo, Miguel Sandoval, chief counselor and ex-Castro intelligence agent Col. Felix Cortez, Jaquim de Almeida,is planing to set up his boss by getting him knocked off by the CIA. Cortez is also setting up rest of the Cartel leaders to be whacked by arraigning a major hit on the US governments representatives in Columbia. Later there's a Cortez sponsored attack in Bogata killing 5 Secret Service Agents and the the FBI chief Jacobs,Tom Tammi, with Cortez pining the attack on the \"innocent\" drug dealers. Cortez has his lover and FBI director Jacobs private secretary Moira Wolfson, Ann Magnuson, unwittingly give him the information of Jacobs whereabouts. This helps Cortez in having Jacobs trapped in a motorcade in downtown Bogata where he was gunned down. Cortez then plans to make a deal with the US, after he had the Cali Cartel leaders knocked off, to take over the cartel's operations and cut the drug supply to the US in half. Making the US government's drug fighting agency DEA and the FBI, as well as President Bennett, look like their \"War on Drugs\" is a big success to the American people, It turns out that Cortez's master plan miss-fires when it's discovered after a massacre of most of the cartel leaders, with the exception of Escobedo, that it wasn't a car bomb that was first reported by the news that did them in! It was a laser-guided missile, that could have only been used by the USAF, that did the job. With the sh*t hitting the fan all over D.C and the members of Congress demanding to know why the US military was involved in this unauthorized \"hit\" two things are quickly put into motion by presidential advisor's Cutter &amp; Ritter 1. the US troops sent into Columbia are sold out by giving up their positions to the cartel mercenaries in order to have them all killed so they'll never live to tell the truth about their mission and 2. Jack Ryan is saddled with the blame for the secret operation with him made, by Cutter &amp; Ritter, to look like he authorized it which he didn't. Despite it's very complicated plot \"Clear and Present Danger\" is a top rate political thriller that never lets up, or lets you down, in it's nerve racking suspense. The movie ends with two great final sequences with Jack Ryan having it out in Columbia with Cortez and his hoods in order for him and Clark, the head of the sold-out US troops, to save the remaining US soldiers held captive. The ending just flipped me, as I assume everyone else who saw it, out with an incredible confrontation between Ryan and President Bennett right in the Oval Office that has to be seen to be believed! It's here more then anywhere else in \" Clear and Present Danger\" where I hoped that for once, just this ONCE, that life would imitate art! nice mix of intrigue and action; President Bennett's friends are murdered by Columbian Cali cartel drug lord Escobedo. He seeks revenge by declaring them Clear and Present Danger. Presidential Adviser James Cutter and Bob Ritter sends John Clark (Willem Dafoe) and his team to direct bombs on the targets. It's a secret mission that neither Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) nor his mentor Jim Greer know about. Greer is sick with cancer. Ryan is appointed Deputy Director of Intelligence and sent down to Bogota. Meanwhile Escobedo has intelligence operative Félix Cortez who has inside info in the White House and plans of his own. It's an intriguing political espionage mixed with some well executed action scenes. The ambush in Bogota is terrific action. Joaquim de Almeida is a great villain. He has a great depth which is perfect for his double dealing. It's a well made Tom Clancy spy movie. Taut political thriller, but is something missing?; I admire what Tom Clancy has written over the years, and can appreciate the close detail he puts into his works. He is in tune with American politico and international affairs, but how can he make it more applicable to mainstream audiences? The answer is Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan, one of my favorite starring actors, one who is always alert to the atmosphere around him, and always seems coolly affected by his environment. \"Clear and Present Danger,\" the third Jack Ryan movie to date, uses Ford's talents at times to great effect, but at other moments seems to ignore him altogether. It is only after two hours of the film has surpassed that we see Ford command the screen, taking charge of his opponents. He didn't somehow resemble the Jack Ryan from the previous film, \"Patriot Games,\" at all. I'm not used to seeing Harrison in the background as much or noticing him dance around situations like a weakling, so I was kind of caught off guard. I felt a mild tinge of excitement from the film's plot, that of a militant force in Colombia and its threatening power over American affairs. Also, I was quite interested in Willem Dafoe's character and his longing to get out of the field of war, but even he wasn't emphasized to a great extent. The President's intervention in the conspiracy was not clearly brought to perspective enough to matter. \"Clear and Present Danger\" does have its moments, its turns of excitement and action sequences, but they come few and far between. Harrison Ford delivers a good performance out of what he is given, but I do not think he was used to the fullest advantage. Somehow, there seems to be a great film underneath this web of international intrigue and drug cartels, but I was unable to receive a satisfactory show. Rating: Two stars and a half. Boring 'thriller'; By definition, a thriller is meant to thrill. This 'thriller' fails to do so. Reprising his role as CIA hotshot Jack Ryan, Harrison Ford looks disinterested as he becomes involved in an undercover war between the American government and some naughty Colombian drug barons. Whereas Patriot Games conveyed some excitement to the viewer, this sequel fails to match that modest achievement. I found myself counting down the minutes till the end. There are endless dull and 'meaningful' conversations in this film, all of which are of no interest to those who crave a bit of glamour and fun from a movie. This film could have been 90 minutes long, edited for action and injected with a little humour. The absence of any real humour actually harms the film the most. A Clint Eastwood or a Kiefer Sutherland would have portrayed Jack Ryan with a touch of class and the odd laugh, but Harrison Ford just bores the audience senseless. The cast is good and the plot could have been developed into something of interest, but I was left feeling empty from viewing this sorry rubbish. It takes itself too seriously. Despite it only being 12 years old, I felt this movie was incredibly dated, more so even that the older Patriot Games. I guess in recent years I have been spoilt by the excellent and always compelling 24. Things have clearly moved on.

Unclear is this Present Danger **1/2; Harrison Ford in this disappointing film about the affects of a Colombian cartel group dealing with drugs. Ford gets a top job at the CIA when the director (James Earl Jones) develops a terminal illness. It seems that the President and his assistant are involved in a covert war in Colombia when they are denying this. Ford, their dupe, appears before Congress and is questioned by the late Hope Lange, who portrays a U.S. senator in one brief scene. The action really starts when an adviser goes to Colombia to negotiate getting back U.S. money. He is murdered there and his assistant, possibly his lover, is found dead the same day as he is killed. The film falls into other Tom Clancy books made into films. There is plenty of action but a lack of cohesiveness. pretty good Clancy adaptation; 'Clear and Present Danger' is full of great scenes which never really come together to make a great movie. It's trying to tell too many different stories and so, even with nearly two and half hours screen time, each story feels too short and incomplete. There are at least a half-dozen major plot threads running concurrently; give the director credit for at least TRYING to fit everything that matters in from another of Tom Clancy's super-fat bestsellers. The other problem though is Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford). He is not the action hero of 'Patriot Games.' Here, he is a dupe at first, then a decoy at the end, and in between sort of a standard-issue government official (albeit a rare honest one). John Clark (Willem Defoe) is the closest thing to a 'hero' present. There is a large ensemble cast, everyone has a role to play, and Ryan frankly is reduced to being just another member of that ensemble. In short, the US President orders (without stating so explicitly, to cover his own butt) a covert military operation against drug cartels in Colombia. Clark heads up a small, elite squad that then begins going around blowing up labs and generally disrupting the drug business. In apparent retaliation, the FBI director and his entourage are killed in their motorcade while on a visit to Bogota. A Cuban intelligence expert working for one of the drug lords approaches National Security Adviser Cutter (the president's right-hand man) for a truce, and a deal-in exchange for his cutting drug exports to the US in half, he wants the inserted military team cut off and abandoned, so he can kill them. As mentioned, there are several other side-plots (Admiral Greer has terminal cancer, an FBI secretary is seduced by the Cuban intelligence agent and murdered) so there is a lot of jumping back and forth among the various players and situations. Among the best scenes is the ambush of the FBI director's motorcade in Colombia; very well-staged and realistic, it's a real nail-biter of a sequence. But there are several other good action set-pieces as well. 'Clear and Present Danger' does not seem as long as it is. It's just too bad the director, Philip Noyce, and the trio of screenwriters couldn't make the film a more cohesive package and found better ways to pump up Ford's role. After 'The Hunt for Red October' and 'Patriot Games,' we have certainly come to expect more from the Jack Ryan character than to be a fall-guy for a slippery Prez and his corrupt underlings, even if he belatedly turns the tables on them. Yet another god awful adaptation; I was once told if you don't have anything nice to say don't say it at all. Unfortunately there's nothing nice i have to say about this movie, and must let you know about the bad... John Clark is portrayed in this movie as some sleezy CIA mercenary, which is entirely untrue. The novels, while much better than this terrible movie, does go more into depth, the movie could at least given Mr. Clark some class. While this movie did stick closer to the original story than Patriot games, it was still terribly far off the mark. While i understand that for a movie some things do need to be deleted, the most important thing they got rid of was the backstory. The event's that set this story in motion are totally missing from the movie, which is truly unacceptable. Don't waste your time on this worthless flop of a film. Bad end action sequece....; The movie was very entertaining and educational but to be a classic in it's genre,it should have had better action sequences towards the end of the movie.Particularly the scenes of the daring rescue of the special forces from the Colombians.The thrill was there but the action was not powerfull enough which fans of this movie subject will definitely demand.Ford may be getting old but he can still pull off better action sequences than what was shown in this movie.Even the scenes where in the US special forces were defeated by the mercenaries could have been way better.The scenes where the CIA guys were ambushed in their vans was very good.They should have continued with those kind of sequences in the other action scenes.It was a bad decition to tone down the violence too much becouse the seriousness of the movie demands realism to become a classic.Still a good try.I know Ford did not like the way it was done as well and that is why he is reluctant as of now to play Jack Ryan again.Ford knows movies well.I give this one an 8 out of 10. Harrison Ford Returns To Play Jack Ryan; Harrison Ford returns to play Jack Ryan in this mega-hit from the summer of 1994. In this follow-up to Patriot Games, Ford gets involved in a scandalous illegal drug war in Columbia orchestrated by top government officials. As with any film over 2 hours long, there are a few slow moments in the movie. However, for the most part, the film stays on course with alternating action, drama, and suspense scenes. Anne Archer and Thora Birch return in more forgettable roles as Ford's wife and daughter. Several other colorful characters are present, especially Joaquim de Almeida as a sinister cartel figure. Willem Dafoe plays a great role as a CIA contact, who supplies the illegal firepower to attack the cartels. His role should have been developed more; he's on screen all too briefly. James Earl Jones also returns for a farewell performance as Greer, Ryan's mentor. Henry Czerny, Harris Yulin, and Donald Moffat make up the oily triumvirate that Faces Ford. The film has terrific action and suspense sequences, especially the cartel's open attack on Ford's government convoy in the SUV's and the computer battle where Ford tries to run off illegal government doings. Ford's actions are consistent with his character, in that, he never saves the day via extraordinary means by himself, as can be customary in these type of films. One of the few false notes is the sanctimonious tendency of Ryan to self righteously bear the torch of truth, when we all know that being in the CIA can compromise that possibility. *** of 4 stars. Another Entertaining and Action Packed Jack Ryan Adventure,; Clear and Present Danger is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a very talented cast.Harrison Ford returns as Jack Ryan for a second outing,and it's more intense and a lot more action than we saw in Patriot Games,Ford clearly still enjoyed playing Ryan and it shows in his performance.Anne Archer also returns as Jack Ryan's wife Cathy,and I find her as annoying as i did in Patriot Games,I haven't seen her in anything else and I know she's suppose to be a very good actress in other things,but I find her characters dialogue and just the way Archer delivers them very irritating and just unrealistic.Clear and Present Danger is action packed and very intense and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great action or thriller. After a close friend of the president of the United States is murdered,Jack Ryan gets involved in a war against a powerful drug cartel. Best Performance: Harrison Ford Worst Performance: Anne Archer A Major Turn Around in the Jack Ryan Series!; The first two Jack Ryan pictures failed to capture my interests in a spy flick but this movie didn't. While the plot really isn't out of this world. It is still a good plot which contains a lot of action sequences and with Harrison Ford on board there is a sense of adventure. I still haven't seen 'The Sum of all Fears' but this is the best and perhaps the only movie in the Jack Ryan series that I like so far. 3(***)out of 4(****)stars Great Clancy novel brought to life.; I have to say that ALL of the Clancy novels that were made into films, with the exception of \"The Sum of All Fears\" were brought to life as great films. Harrison Ford reprises his role as Dr. Jack Ryan, who is forced in this film to step into the shoes of Admiral Greer, who is dying. While there is a lot of each characters personal lives carefully inserted into the film, it NEVER ceases to be clever and interesting. It's much better to watch than any senseless action picture with Bruce Willis or your wimpy little Ben Affleckish character. The film is perfectly balanced so that there is not a single boring scene in the picture. The wheels are constantly turning to make sure something dramatic is happening to really draw you further into the picture. I recommend this movie as well as it's two predecessors, \"The Hunt for Red October\", and \"Patriot Games\". Both of which are equally brilliant. Good covert story of intrigue; How many things go on daily in government planning that we, the public, and, frankly, the media, never find out about. This film reminds us of this factor and I liked its constant attention to corruption at the highest levels of government. We all know its there, but a constant reminder of it is a good thing. The drug angle that Jack Ryan investigates, tied in with the secret hit squad hired to bring it own, put these events on a collision course that is unpredictable, highly suspenseful and tense. Willem Dafoe's character as the mercenary is my only complaint. Not a complaint against Dafoe but how his part was under written. A little more development would have helped the story nicely. Condensed Clancy; The makers of this movie are to be congratulated for turning a Tom Clancy doorstop into a tense, tightly woven international thriller with a top notch cast and believeable plot. Where the previous two Jack Ryan movies depended on stunts and quite unbelieveable plot twists this film concentrates on a grubby little military/political incident (more the domain of intelligence men) and the men of honour and integrity (Ford and an under used Dafoe) trapped in the middle of it. I also like this movie for its subtle dig at the American establishment and how it assumes it can coerce the weak into doing its bidding. The Clark character in Clancy's fiction is an interesting one and deserves to be further developed. Casting Willem Dafoe in the part was actually a stroke of genius, and I could easily imagine his character in Platoon doing this kind of work if he had survived Vietnam. The fact that Dafoe is one of THE most underrated actors in Hollywood also means I like this. John Clark and John Clark; I loved the movie. I've watched it many times. However, last night I noticed something strange. In Clear and Present Danger, Greer tells Jack Ryan to look up Clark when he gets to Bogota. Of course, Jack Ryan does meet John Clark. Supposedly, Jack Ryan has been with the CIA for some time now, considering the position he holds. Acutually, Ryan should know who Clark is. In the \"Sum of All Fears\", another great movie, which is supposedly a prequel, young Jack Ryan goes on a mission with John Clark. Therefore, in Clear and Present Danger, Jack Ryan already knows who John Clark is. Am I mistaken on this? Also, the \"Sum of All Fears\" is not shown as much as Clear and Present Danger. Standard but well made movie.; This is a good and above average political thriller with action elements in it. Still the movie gets a bit too complicated at times and isn't always easy to follow. The movie is also long and some point of the movie are dragging on, even though the pace always remains good and high. It's hard to say in which genre this movie can be put. For an action movie it doesn't have enough action and for a thriller the story isn't good enough. It makes \"Clear and Present Danger\" a bit of a mixed movie that is far from perfect but still remains a perfectly watchable movie with some great actors and some memorable moments. Main problem I had with the movie is that it lacked a distinctive visual style. A problem all Phillip Noyce movies always have. That's why I'm not a too big fan of Phillip Noyce movies, with the exception of \"Dead Calm\" maybe, which simply had a very solid and tense story. \"Clear and Present Danger\" is a good made movie but it just is too simply and standard done all and it isn't really anything new. The cast is great and has some big names in it; Harrison Ford, James Earl Jones, Harris Yulin, Donald Moffat, Henry Czerny, Joaquim de Almeida, Miguel Sandoval, Benjamin Bratt, Willem Dafoe, Ted Raimi in a small role and a still very young Thora Birch. The music by James Honer is really good. Even though it's typical Horner stuff, like he always used in his '90's movies, it works really well for the movie and truly uplifts the movie at times. There are some good moments in the movie that are highly memorable such as the convoy ambush which has become a bit of a classic already perhaps. Yes, the movie is perfectly watchable but the story isn't always the best to follow and at times the storytelling is lacking. Still, a movie that I would recommend to you. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ Politics: Put On Your Hip Waders!; Spoilers Ahead: My favorite Clancy based movie. It has such depth to it and also works on many levels. As a pure adventure movie, it is excellent. Yet, I adore the movie for a wonderful trip into the excremental world of politics. Even people from other countries, believe me, it has relevance to you. Politicians are just like this wherever on earth you go. My favorite line is Moffat's president, caught with his pants down, killing civilians in an illegal drug war, leaving his own soldiers out for target practice,\"Jack, you won't do that, you got yourself a chip in the big game now. You're going to save that for when your own ass in on the line and I'm going to cash that in for you.\" A well written movie that adumbrates the whole Iran / Contra drug store the White House was running with that great patriot who lived on the 5th amendment and the world's worst memory. You will pick up who Clancy is speaking about here's a big hint, listen for Ritter saying,\"There you go again,\" ring any bells? Notice what's on the president's desk that lovely jar of jelly beans? Beyond the thinly veiled look into the wonderful way to fund a clandestine army with cocaine, the movie is such an exciting, well written, suspenseful piece of work. With Dafoe and Earl Jones in support, you really get some great acting. Even if my analysis bores or you disagree with, it is worth owning. I like Patriot Games, except for the ending, but this towers over it. It stays with me because of the trip into the world of politics which Clancy's narrative has such a feel for authenticity about it. Even non philosophers have an innate sense of truth, I think that is why this was such a big hit. Czerny's Ritter is my favorite character what a great depiction of an amoral, ladder climbing, take no prisoners low life. This is the core of why the movie works so well, even during what should be slow parts at the White House. The movie moves very well, the politics are quite few and far in between. There are some great action set pieces; the attack on the Motorcade, the jet missile attack on the drug lords and the final rescue of the prisoners. Do not be fooled by my review, the politics take a back seat to the action filled story. Why you should watch it is for the depths. Be sure to put on your hip waders because you are going to be around politicians, hold your nose. The slime cannot be exaggerated; as scathing a delineation as this movie is, I still think it is even worse than this. It won't make you want to race out and vote. Ryan barely escapes with his skin when those government servants, who put the Mafia to shame, paint a giant bulls-eye on his backside. The showdown scene between Ryan and The President is worth owning the movie for. I loved all of them but the Ben Affleck one but this one is forty stories above the rest for what I would call: Into The World Of Politics Get Those Hepatitis Shots First. A Good Movie. One of my all time favorite movies; A CIA anaylst, Jack Ryan(Harrison Ford), is promoted to  Deputy Director of Intelligence of the CIA after Admiral James Greer(James Earl Jones) suffers from illness. A close friend of the president(Donald Moffat) is murdered. The situation gets worse when the President is convinced to take actions against the drug cartels. Felix Cortez plays both sides. He tries to \"inform\" the CIA and he also works with the cartels. James Cutter(Harris Yulin) an advisor to the President, makes a deal with Cortez, and cuts off communications to troops in Columbia, through the Deputy Director of CIA Operations, Robert Ritter(Henry Czerny). Ryan goes to Colombia to save the troops with the help of John Clark(Willem Dafoe),  but not before Ritter blames Ryan for Clark's men being captured by Cortez's mercenaries. Clear and Present Danger is a great action/political thriller that is one of my all time favorite movies. Ford gives a great performance, perhaps his best. Theres also a great supporting cast including Willem Dafoe, Henry Czerny, and James Earl Jones. Besides powerful drama, Clear and Present Danger supplies good action sequences. I haven't read the book, but I plan to after seeing this movie. Although the plot is a bit complex, this is a great movie and a must see. If you like Ford, action, or great drama, then Clear and Present Danger is a movie you should see. This film recieves my highest recommendation. 10/10 One of the better Harrison Ford movies, but not his best; I'm not going to say that Harrison Ford is my most favorite actor, but I sure like to see him play. That's why I've already seen several of his movies and that's also the reason why I gave this movie a try. I'm normally not too much a fan of action movies, but with him in one of the leading roles, you can always expect something more and better than some simple spectacle. \"Clear and Present Danger\" is a movie based on a Tom Clancy novel that tells the story of Doctor Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst who finds himself in the middle of a power struggle within the Colombian drug cartel as well as some dirty political games in the highest ranks of the American political establishment. It all starts with the murder of a close friend and his family of the American president aboard their yacht in the Caribbean, apparently in retaliation for stealing money as part of a money laundering scheme for the cartel. When some of the president's men convince the president to conduct covert actions against the cartel, without telling the Congress of course, and the security chief of one of the cartel bosses tries to play both sides by informing his boss, but trying to organize a coup against the cartel leadership with the help of the CIA at the same time, Ryan soon gets in a very difficult position. When he finds out the entire truth, he sets himself the almost impossible task to save the men that were left behind in the jungle, while trying to save his own reputation and life... Whether everything shown in this movie is possible or not, I can not really say. But one thing is for sure and that is that we certainly will not know everything the president of the USA is involved in or has knowledge of. I'm convinced that everywhere in the world, the CIA does play some dirty tricks so now and then, as long as it is beneficial for them and / or the country. So in that perspective I must say that this entire movie feels quite believable. And even though this isn't the best movie I've ever seen Harrison Ford play in, I must say that he did a nice job in this movie. His character is still believable, because he never seems to use any weapons and certainly isn't some kind of superman who can escape from entire armies without getting a scratch (although it sometimes started to look like it). I don't think the average CIA office worker is used to carry a lot of guns, machine guns, hand grenades, bazooka's or I don't know what other weaponry you sometimes see them use in all those cheap action flicks, so it's a good thing that they didn't have Jack Ryan carry them either. But there is one thing I don't really believe: I don't think that the CIA would ever send such a high ranking employee in the field. Nevertheless, Harrison Ford did a nice job with his role and the same can be said about Willem Dafoe, Anne Archer,... But in the end this is a bit too much an action movie to my taste, even though the action shots are certainly nice to watch. The story and the acting are OK and make that this movie is a lot better than the average action flick. That's why I give this movie a rating between 6.5/10 and 7/10. Not even political fiction, just plain reality; At first it looks like a banal drug film with some CIA agents trying to find out who killed a couple of people and why, people who were personal friends of the President of the US. Just that makes things tricky, I mean the fact that the victims were friends of the President of the US. Be discreet Jack. But things are also trickier than they look and I don't want to tell you the film. I am just going to give a few ideas about politics first. A politician always lies, by definition and by principle. It sounds pessimistic and it is. Never believe a politician, no matter what side he is on and what side you are on. A politician will always do what the circumstances will make him do under pressure. If he is wise he will listen to his advisers and he will think then. If he is not wise he will run into the wall and push with his head. He may break through, but anyway afterwards he will tell you tall tales. The second element is that you have to serve politicians, no matter what and just try to cover your back and by back I mean under your lower back. You can serve them well it does not matter. If there is a problem you will be the fuse. If the problem was big, you may be the fuse, but the politicians will get it on their heads. But that will not give you what you deserve: a medal and a premium for serving them well. The film brings up another line of reflection. Politicians do not give a damn about the life of the people who are defending the country or who are fighting just or unjust wars for their country. Politicians consider these fighters as pawns on their chessboard and if they die they are collateral victims of their own game. Too bad for them they were those who had to die. If they died with honor they might get some coverage and recognition, otherwise they might get buried under a pile of rocks in some jungle. Their families will be handed a casket full of stones. But beyond these fighters in uniform do not believe civilians are in any way considered in this matter. Civilians are not even collateral damage. They are just collateral garbage. And unluckily that's the fundamental point here. Who cares about children, women, and plain civilians. They should not have been here in the first place. Good riddance, next time they will not be dumb enough to be present on a future mass crime scene. That's how you get out of that film. And the last scene will not change anything. There is no justice in such a situation. You may see the politician who exploited you fall because his arrogance brings him down, but that will not be justice for you who will have footed the bill of that liar. So make up your mind and just accept to be used, over-used and abused by politicians: that's their fundamental function and you are a sucker by definition since you are not in politics. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID Not a good screenplay from book (contains spoilers); It's no wonder why Tom Clancy was angered with the making of his books into movies after Patriot Games. Many characters from the book were changed from the start of the movie. The movie was confusing for most audience members because it left out many chapters and sub plots from the book. In the book Jack Ryan does not find out the connection to the drug cartel until after the covert operation began because he never had a briefing with the President because the President had already made a statement of Clear and Present Danger. Ryan never meets Clark until after Escobedo's was bombed from an aerial strike. The movie also left out Samuel Jackson's character(Robby) out of the movie when he was a major part in the book discovering about the Covert Operation in Columbia. Harrison Ford Anne Archer and James Earl Jones reprized their roles with finesse. If you are an avid reader of Tom Clancy this movie will disappoint you. A Colombian's point of view; ---THIS MAY CONTAIN SMALL SPOILERS, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK-- This movie is quite believable. The plot I mean. The bad guys are there too, and the drug cartels life is in some way accurate. But it has a lot of disappointing details. Small details, like: - The president of the U.S. being emotional and taking a personal vendetta? - Isn't it naive to pretend to win a war against drugs with a commando force and taking down some drug lords? - Hollywood's ability to investigate and simulate real locations is frankly embarrassing. The have an ability to make fool of themselves for erratic representations and show their big ignorance with the way they show life in underdeveloped places. Bogota is characterized as a dusty, hot and poor city. Bogota is not dusty, not ugly and is cold. I've never seen places even close to the ones showed in the movie. They shoot in places in Mexico, but guys: Not everything below the great river looks like Mexico. Not every Colombian is a drug dealer, as I guess not every American is a junkie or an ignorant, neither stupid. But if we take what Hollywood shows looks that way. They might shoot the Bogota scenes in Mexico City, it is a lot more similar to the real Bogota. -You can see soldiers everywhere you go to. They show Bogota as a place where you can get killed by a sniper in any minute. Far away from the real thing, taking off the credibility of the movie, and also creating a false and erratic image of a whole country. - This lack of investigation from people involved in the representation of tropical countries is not new, and not over. \"The fockers\" is even more embarrassing, show a even bigger ignorance of how a country really is. For a production costing several millions of dollars, they might take the hassle to investigate a little more (at least investigate) and not to make fool of themselves. -A high rank CIA officer going to the jungle to rescue some soldiers and fist-figthing drug lords? Come on! And for the record: paramilitaries, guerrillas and Colombian soldiers use nice uniforms, in some way very similar to the U.S. soldier's ones. After all, those uniforms are made here too.. ;). And drug lords don't use bodyguards with cheap formal suits. They dress casual and classy too. Military Police uniforms were accurate, at least something good. Like it was said in the first part of the movie: \"as long as there are consumers, the will be someone providing you drugs, no matter where they come from\". That's why I liked the movie, it is a realistic story. Not very well represented (at least the Colombian part), but I've seen worst. Involving, although often too robotic, Ryan entry which knows what it has to do but often strikes us as to not knowing how to do it.; Where does one go after having taken on, and successfully parried, the threat of that of both Communism and Terrorism? Why, to wage war on Narcotics of course. At least, that is how the good folks charged with bringing to life the adventures of a C.I.A. agent named Jack Ryan see it, as too does the series original author Tom Clancy, whose source material I read was actually published on the brink of the Cold War's termination. With the Irish and the Soviets vanquished, that of Colombia's cocaine barons are next up on the chopping block for the world's most powerful intelligence agency. There is an eerie procession to things in that regard that mirrors today, an attitude of bountifully hopping from ideology to ideology; from nationality to nationality usurping the tyrants and conquering the odds not so far away from modern foreign policy: the action starts when things kick off that we like neither the looks or sounds of it. Clear and Present Danger is probably the most cryptic of the first three Ryan adaptations  I imagine its title is meant somewhat ironically, as there are times when things are anything but clear and the narrative can actually be quite overwhelming. Thankfully, this is not a case of the same stuff being regurgitated as Ryan charges about; does his thing and works everything out in the end. This is the sort of 'action' film whereby romping scores of circumstance and pomp put to sets heavy in the decour of American governmental iconography, as two men bicker and grimace intently over a situation, is discernible as the 'spectacle'. Things have moved on internally, also. Where in \"The Hunt for Red October\" Ryan was more of a middle man caught in a cross-fire who was charged with investigating and, ultimately, defusing a situation, his role changed dramatically in \"Patriot Games\", where he found himself an agent at the heart of a field operation. In Phillip Noyce's Clear and Present Danger, he has effectively been promoted to that of chief of operations following some health issues with James Earl Jones' evergreen \"M\" figure. The film begins where the last one culminated: at sea. An American Navy vessel flags down a luxury yacht which, to their horror, has been invaded by rouge South American Cartel members and has had its rightful owners executed. Where things suddenly become relevant is when this innocent party of murder victims are revealed to have been close friends to the American president, something which launches an investigation where previously these tyrants were getting away with the horrors associated with trafficking; smuggling and murder anyway. The leader of these renegades is a certain Ernesto Escobedo (Sandoval), who's a poor excuse for a Robert Davi villain from a then-not-too-recent Bond film about similar themes. Escobedo is rich; has a huge house; a loving family and enjoys baseball, but from within a certain Cuban aide by the name of Cortez (de Almeida) has his own ideas on Escobedo's empire. The film launches itself into too very distinct cuts of raw material, with on the one hand Ryan's task of leading the Cartel investigation dominating with a very blue, very cold Washington atmosphere as the snow and chilly conditions settle in just as equally cold levels of animosity are met with practically everything Ryan does via his peers. On the other, an elite team of SEAL commandos land in the warmer, greener and brighter South American jungles. The team is mostly made up of insignificant extras, although one such trooper of a sniper class gets his own introduction et al. early on; thus, it is of little surprise that he's the only one left upon which to focus when the mission gets messy later on. One item, of which there can be little doubt, is Harrison Ford's worthiness in the role. There is a moment early on when he walks into his superior's office; there is a smirk, some small talk and a pile of papers outlining the latest situation. Straight away, we're at home with him in the role and he brings a measured assuredness to the part. The film plays out with that invisible confidence films as cryptic as these often have, that nonchalant swagger as it dives into yet another scene drenched in conflict and suspicion; only assuming that you're keeping up but delivering the blows for you even if you haven't quite. It certainly reminds us of how good-a job the team made of The Hunt for Red October, which was equally involving in this regard although always had the benefit of things zeroing in on that lone submarine so things were never going to be able to go too far astray in the first place. To another extent, it highlights just how limp in comparison to \"Hunt\" Patriot Games was; a revenge film which is made to look fairly bog-standard and unspectacular in comparison in spite of its traversing of the globe and its taking of its characters to some pretty dire emotional places. Perhaps that was the point; Noyce has essentially overcompensated in that regard, lumping onto us more of what we thought we got in \"Hunt\" that we didn't get any of in \"Games\"  something that was Noyce's fault in the first place. As a result, I think it finds a comfortable spot in-between the two. A commercial thriller that lacks intelligence and ignores complexity but is still entertaining and provides good thrills on the Hill and in the jungle; When Admiral Greer is diagnosed with cancer, Jack Ryan finds himself as Acting Deputy Director of Intelligence at the same time as one of the President's personal friends is murdered by a Columbian drugs cartel. Despite the suggestion that his friend was involved in illegal money laundering the President gives the \"unofficial\" nod to National Security Adviser Cutter who falsifies a Presidential Order for Robert Ritter to employ a covert operation to strike at Escobedo's operations in Columbia. Meanwhile Ryan goes before the Senate to get funding for the fight on drugs  although the funding does not include troops or direct action, which doesn't concern Jack as he is out of the loop on the covert op. While Jack tries to trace the money on the laundering, Clark's men get bombing in the Columbia jungle. However as things start to get out of control, political backs get covered, plausible deniability kicks in and both Ryan and Slater find themselves exposed and in danger. Despite Ryan's outings in Patriot Games and Sum of All Fears being roundly average at best, I decided to try this film and I actually found it quite easy to enjoy. The first thing to state is that it is very safe and commercial thriller in that, for all its supposed commentary on corruption and drugs, it really doesn't say much and the good guys and bad guys are painted very clearly and the lines between them are clean. Those familiar with the much more interesting look at America and drugs presented in HBO's The Wire will not find the same level of intelligence or comment in this film. Of course this doesn't make this a bad film, but perhaps a weaker one. The plot uses these clear lines and turns in an enjoyable if basic mix of political drama and action thrills. I found myself quite gripped by some parts and the plot regularly throw up tough talking and action to keep things interesting. Although Ford is already looking a bit older, he fits in perfectly on the \"intelligence\" side of the film but when he is called into action on the streets of Columbia then he doesn't look the part at all. Much better at this is Dafoe, who spends the majority of this in his own little action movie. He is convincing and was a good call for the role, although it doesn't help that the material calls for Ford to occupy equal status with him in the action stakes. Providing the political tough talk with good turns are Czerny, Yulin and Moffat  each would have benefited from the script recognising the complexities of right and wrong but this wasn't the place for that. Almedia and Sandoval are both pretty average but they are handed half-cooked clichés to work with so it isn't really their fault. Overall this is a perfectly serviceable commercial thriller and I have no doubt that those who accepted the problems in Patriot Games and Sum of All Fears will find this easy to enjoy. Personally I would have liked a bit more intelligence instead of the black/white approach but it still worked for what it was and it was effective in catching me up. A truly American film.; An excellent film, with the always outstanding Harrison Ford at the helm, Clear and Present Danger is the third of Tom Clancy's works to be adapted to the big screen and the second with Ford as Jack Ryan, the patriotic ex-marine turned politician. With the CIA director - played by the James Earl Jones - befallen by pancreatic cancer, Jack Ryan is 'promoted' to acting CIA director in his absence. Once there he becomes involved - unbeknownst to him - in a series of plots that answers the question of what would happen if the United States used some of its brawn to do what is morally right if not politically right, the covert eradication of drug producers in Columbia. Complete with a powerful and brutal scene where American policy makers are caught in an ambush in a run down section of Bogota that is sure to surprise and thrill you. Willem Dafoe does a terrific job of playing Joe Clark, who those of you familiar with Clancy's work will undoubtedly know. Harrison Ford, the Reluctant Action Star; CIA Analyst Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) is drawn into an illegal war fought by the US government against a Colombian drug cartel. James Berardinelli remarked, \"Clear and Present Danger is all plot and no characters. The people running around on screen have about as much depth as the sheen of sweat on Harrison Ford's forehead. Jack Ryan is the most disappointing of all. He's disgustingly virtuous: a flawless fighter for good and justice, a Superman without the cape. I spent half the movie wondering if this guy was ever going to show anything to mark him as vaguely human.\" That just seems too harsh, and for no good reason. This is an action film, after all. Sure, we do not get the depth we might like from Jack Ryan, but we have already developed him in two prior films. This is action, a spy thriller. We need twists, turns, gunfire and explosions! (And we get them, too.) Read the book, don't watch the movie; It's not hard to see why Tom Clancy doesn't give his approval to the movie that are based on his books. There isn't a single plot line in the book that the movie doesn't butcher. The cast is good, and if the movie had actually followed the book, the movie could have been great.  I hate to criticize Harrison Ford movies, but this one disappointed me. Thrilling!; Based on the book of the same name by Tom Clancy, 'Clear and Present Danger' is a thrilling film, that is neatly written, tautly directed &amp; superbly acted. In short, Amongst the Finest Films from 1994! As in the novel, Jack Ryan is appointed Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Acting Deputy Director and discovers that he is being kept in the dark by colleagues who are conducting a covert war against drug lords in Colombia. Jack Ryan is a great hero to root for. Tom Clancy has indeed given us an Iconic Good-Guy, who in many ways, is a time-less personality. 'Clear and Present Danger' begins superbly and ends with a bang. The Writing Material is so Sharp, that it catches your attention right away. Also, The tense moments as well as the action-sequences, are wonderfully shot &amp; executed. Phillip Noyce's Direction is taut. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is good. Art Design is perfect. Performance-Wise: Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan, is in full form. The Screen Legend delivers a terrific performance from start to end. Willem Dafoe is first-rate. Anne Archer is impressive. James Earl Jones is dignified. Miguel Sandoval leaves a mark. Others lend able support. On the whole, A Winner! Check It Out! The Clear and Present Danger for me was being put to sleep at times  with this movie.; The movie was not all bad, but compared to the other two Clancy movies I have seen (Patriot Games/The Hunt for Red October) this one was by far the least entertaining and least interesting of the bunch. It is also not very memorable as I have a hard time recollecting much about it aside from William Defoe's rather good performance and Harrison Ford as a not quite as intense Jack Ryan as he was in the \"Patriot Games\". Anne Archer is back as well, unfortunately she may as well not be in the movie at all as they have basically assigned her a cameo appearance in this one which is sad considering how much of a factor she was in the previous movie. Still, that is understandable as she may have not played all that an important of a role in the novel either. The action comes in small doses and there is a particularly good one featuring a bunch of cars being blocked in and a missile launcher, however the connection I felt with the characters in \"Patriot Games\" is lost so none of the action scenes really reel me in as they did in the previous two movies as the characters are not as interesting as say those in \"The Hunt for Red October\". Still thanks to William Defoe and some good action here and there it is not a total loss in the least. A good thriller.; Clear and Present Danger is part of the continuing chronicles of the life of CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford).(spoilers) It follows how the government starts a war against the drug cartels in Colombia. The only catch is the Colombian government doesn't know about it. This movie is better than I've reviewed it and it has lots of action. Though don't expect a lot similarities between it and the book it has a lot but not all of them. 6 *'s out of 10 *'s. Does not work for me!; The third installment in the cinematic incarnation of Tom Clancy's CIA analyst Jack Ryan and the second starring Harrison Ford, this follow-up to Patriot Games is a more complex, rewarding, and bolder film than its predecessor. Ford returns as Ryan, this time embroiled in a failed White House bid to wipe out a Colombian drug cartel and cover up the mess. The script, by Clancy and John Milius (Red Dawn), has an air of true adventure about it as Ryan places himself in harm's way to extract covert soldiers abandoned in a Latin American jungle. There are a couple of remarkable set pieces expertly handled by Patriot Games director Phillip Noyce, especially a shocking scene involving an ambush on Ryan's car in an alley. The supporting cast is superb, including Willem Dafoe as the soldiers' leader, Henry Czerny as Ryan's enemy at the CIA, Joaquim De Almeida as a smooth-talking villain, Ann Magnuson as an unwitting confederate in international crime, and James Earl Jones as Ryan's dying boss. The DVD release has a widescreen presentation, theatrical trailer, closed captioning, optional French soundtrack, and optional Spanish subtitles. Good enough.; It was ",
       " decent. After \"The Hunt for Red October\", this is the best Clancy movie so far. This is not saying much though since these movies have either been amazing or awful (yes, I'm talking about the last one). It stays true to the book, the plot development is a bit slow so you need to be patient. As true to a Clancy novel, there is no \"one guy saves the world\" type of thing here. Good people die, bad people die, neutral people die. The conclusion is bittersweet, more like a pyrrhic victory, which I like. I must admit it, getting a Tom Clancy novel in script form is not easy since his works tend to be very, very complex, with multiple sub-plots. However, they did a great job on this one. It's not a 10 but it is an solid 8. Dullest of the series.; Jack Ryan III confirms why he can't be a James Bond for the nineties - he's just too boring, although Ford does try his hardest. A relic of its time; It's really amazing just how bad a great many films used to be. The acting is typically staid, apparently intended to replicate the faux-seriousness of CNN. None of the characters really make sense. I found the drug lord to be the most entertaining one of them all. Is this an action film? Then it's a mediocre one. There are some good fight scenes, and the explosions are nifty, but it's all pretty much irrelevant to the story. Is it a political intrigue? I guess, but the story just wasn't that compelling to me. So, somebody made a deal with some rich guy to launder money, then ... murder and war? Whatever. Ultimately, this was an attempt to make a violent parallel to Watergate, which no coincidentally was also as hopelessly impossible to understand. But, back the early 1990s, the media was desperate to relive the Watergate golden days. As unbelievable as the show is, it makes sense in a historical context. Clear and Present Danger; Ford returns as CIA Jack Ryan who now combats Colombian drug  cartels in this entertaining film version of the Tom Clancy novel. While entertaining, Ford is beginning to show his age with these roles. The worst installment of a bad series; Film adaptations of Tom Clancy's bestselling novels have never really measured up to the success of the books and this third film outing of Clancy's most popular character, CIA agent Jack Ryan, ranks as the worst adaptation of all. The book of the same name was the bestselling novel of the 1980's but probably one of the worst films of the 1990's. Harrison Ford reprises his \"Patriot Games\" role as Ryan. This time out, Ryan works to uncover and expose a working connection between a South American drug ring and an advisor for the U.S. President. Long before this dull film was over, it didn't really matter to me anymore how it was going to turn out. Most other viewers may feel the same way here. Stick with the novels because the film adaptations are just not as engrossing for some odd reason. This movie is superficial, biased and deceitful.; Oh my god. This movie is just another proof of how some people don't give a damn about making stories that respect people and at least show a little truth about other countries and cultures. This movie's representation of Colombia is just like Americans like to see people that they consider inferior, and criminal, thus, subject to be humiliated by means of a pathetic motion picture. This movie shows American, or Hollywood's, total ignorance about Colombia and the whole drug trafficking problem. I know is just a movie, but people around the world, naive or stupid people, believe in what movies show like if it was God's truth. Sure, this is just another action movie with predictable characters and plot, nothing to be studied further. Nonetheless, it hurts to see movies that only promote hatred and discrimination against Colombians. This picture shows the way Hollywood works: \"you can sell people crap, and make them eat it\" Jack is back; \"Clear and Present Danger\" is the second adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel to feature Harrison Ford as CIA agent Jack Ryan. This film involves a murder which is linked to drug cartels in Colombia and the subsequent efforts to take action against the cartels. Harrison Ford proves again that he is well-suited to the role of Jack Ryan and more appropriate than Alec Baldwin and Ben Affleck for the role. There are some great supporting performances as well, particularly from James Earl Jones, Willem Dafoe and Henry Czerny. Henry Czerny developed an interesting character and the rivalry between him and Jack Ryan was excellent. The story of this film is better developed than that of \"Patriot Games\" (1992), which is why I prefer this film. It goes beyond a simple \"Jack Ryan combats criminals\" story. There is not a lot of intrigue per se, but some interesting turns and friction between Ryan and officials within the United States government. There are also some well-made action sequences in the film to supplement the story. The film's ending was interesting and appropriate. \"Clear and Present Danger\" proved to be more interesting than its predecessor film, \"Patriot Games\" (1992). A course of action, that he can suggest....he can't.; Harrison Ford. Willem Dafoe. Anne Archer. James Earl Jones. Benjamin Bratt. Henry Czerny, Harris Yulin as a 'heavy' (National Security Adviser : James Cutter ) and Dean Jones. They have a cast of old school heavies and new talent all together. I hadn't seen Dean Jones in a while and he was fantastic! There is a 'chilling weight', that scores the film visually from the onset. The director Phillip Noyce, uses broad scenery (from what I can tell) it brings out a feeling of grandness, vast and encompassing. It just sort of takes control of the mind and vision. The story of a Cartel from Columbia taking 'Liberties' on a family that wound up unbeknown to Escabedo (the Cartel scumbag) being friends of the President of The United States of America. Violent liberties that have become deadly serious. A Cali Cartel. A decision, that the President discusses with his defense secretary. A course of action that he (The President) can't suggest, is exactly what he is suggesting, behind closed doors. Being inside the White House in a Tom Clancy /Phillip Noyce film always seems very real for me, as I watch the government employees walk and talk and what ever else. This has to be one of the highest Clancy novel/ movies that I have seen, just above \" Patriot Games \". Czerny is so good at being maligned. He is the one you don't want to be in a face-off with in a CIA office. He truly brings out a roundly compelling performance as Deputy Director of the C.I.A. ' Robert Ritter' . Deception, is all around. like a sort of wall-papering. Who can Jack trust when he must? This is a powerful story and a dramatic and strong ending that completes the story from start to middle and ending. I was very enthusiastic and impressed, by the directing performance, photography and music score. The film crew that worked on 'Patriot Games' (1992) was retained for this one too. I saw an inside interview about the production of 'Clear and present danger' and the Producer stated that Harrison Ford performed his driving stunt, during the ambush!! And in regard to that beautiful drug dealer home in the country, get this...it was not 'CGI' special effects, they actually blew the house to bits!!!! Yes, it was real too. Now thats how to make a top-end action adventure/ thriller, in my book. Can you believe this, of all the Ten and twenty million dollar salaries that Ford makes in his work, he barely got paid one-million for this body of work. This is a keeper. Recommended again and again. (*****) Another Winner Based on a Tom Clancy Novel.; Another intense winner from novelist Tom Clancy that is intelligent, complicated and well-made. Once again Jack Ryan returns (Harrison Ford) and this time he must take on a Colombian drug cartel that has murdered a close friend of the U.S. president (Donald Moffat). The president then sends a task force into Colombia to fight the cartel without the knowledge of Congress. This is of course an illegal act which will lead to problems at home and abroad. The task force, led by Willem Dafoe, fails and it is up to Harrison Ford to make all things right again. The film is smart, but truly confusing at times. Ford once again shines and he gets ample support from a strong cast. The direction is focused and the film ends up being another interesting action-thriller. 4 stars out of 5. Blah; I don't know why, but this movie failed to hold my interest. I like all of the cast members, the photography and direction seemed OK, and the book it was based on was great. It just didn't seem to come together. Willem Defoe did well in his role, although I agree that he was miscast, from the perspective of the book. True, you can't film a whole Clancy novel without making a 40 hour movie, but \"Hunt for Red October\" made a very good film. I haven't seen \"Patriot Games\" so I cannot comment on that. Grade: D Enemies Within And Without; Someone once said that absolute power corrupts absolutely. That saying is the theme at the heart of Clear And Present Danger, the third film in the Jack Ryan film series. With a near perfect combination of acting, action, music and script it is also a thriller of the highest quality. Harrison Ford takes his performance of Jack Ryan up to a new level with this film. His performance as the principled Ryan stays int eh front seat at all times as Ryan confronts those in the film, especially in the final scenes of the film. Ford is also at the top of his game in the action sequences of the film as well proving yet again that Ford is both a fine actor and a fine action hero as well. The rest of the cast is good as well. Willem Dafoe makes a welcomed good guy appearance as Clark, the mysterious CIA operative leading the secret war. Anne Archer makes a welcomed return as Cathy Ryan though she is underused sadly. There's also Henry Czerny and Harris Yulin as the me leading the war of behalf of their President (played expertly by Donald Moffat) plus there's Joaquin De Almeida, Miguel Sandoval, Raymond Cruz, Tim Grimm and of course James Earl Jones. In truth the whole cast is good enough to mention if there was enough space. Of course there's the action sequences of the film. Of special mention is the signature ambush sequence that easily belongs amongst the best action sequences ever dedicated on a frame of film. While that sequence alone is excellent one can't forget about the many other (and smaller) sequences in the film that are no less impressive. Overall though it is unfair to call this an action film by any means. If anything can this describe this film it is the words \"thriller of the highest quality\". The screenwriters took Tom Clancy's superb novel, trimmed down to film length, but kept many of the novel's key points. The result is, when put together with Phillip Noyce's direction and the superb score of James Hormer, an intelligent thrill ride where the corruption of absolute power leads to a secret war with lives and the reputations of nations at stakes where enemies are both within and without with only one man capable of unraveling it all. Clear And Present Danger is a thriller of the most unusual kind. It is a thriller that (in the words of Jack Ryan) sees the world not in black and white but as right and wrong. With its tale of a secret war and hidden agendas, the film is all the better for it. It may even be the best of the Jack Ryan films made so far but don't take my word for it. Go see the film for your self. The war on drugs gets a Machiavellian make-over.; In a Machiavellian storyline, Jack Ryan (played by Harrison Ford) is embroiled in a political agenda to cut off the Columbian Drug Lords and get \"revenge\" for the US president - whose friend was been murdered by \"drug tsar\" Ernesto Escobedo (played very well by Miguel Sandoval). The plot is very good and reminds viewers that even politicians can be the bad guys - but I think it overplayed the whole \"Ryan is good\", perhaps Clancy was annoyed by the rhetoric of politicians and decided to write a novel about it. The action sequences are very well done too, but it tries too hard to be a suspenseful political action-adventure movie by incorporating ideas and themes from all the other Jack Ryan movies and putting them into one box. I don't mind the fact its not the book, I thought this was a very good film about political agendas and the war on drugs. During the film we see Escobedo and Ryan team up - but I thought this would be a novel thing to have in future films and novels - Ryan's contact in Columbia just happens to be the country's top drug lord....but it was not to be. Anyhow - I thought this was a good political action-adventure movie that perhaps tried a little too hard on the action. Overall: 6/10. Top-notch Political Thriller; Clear and Present Danger is an exciting addition to the world of Jack Ryan, delving deep into the world of international politics. Nail-biting suspense and explosive action sequences add to the movie, with some truly awesome military special operations added to the mix as well. The inner conflict between acting CIA Deputy Director Jack Ryan and Robert Ritter is extremely entertaining, Harrison Ford and Henry Czerny play their parts impeccably, as do Willem Dafoe as John Clark, James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer and Raymond Cruz as cool soldier Domingo Chavez. Do not miss this top-notch political thriller! Harrison Ford on form in an excellent movie; I have read some quite negative reviews of this film, with many being upset by the lack of coherence with the book despite taking it's characterisations etc...I agree that the film does not follow the book particularly well but it is a film, for film watchers, not a book or a film for book readers so stop criticising it on that level. This film is entertaining from start to finish with a surprisingly clever plot considering the genre and credit must go to Ford for starring and excelling in yet another blockbuster. People may say he's not the most versatile actor in the world and I'm not going to disagree, but he does what he does brilliantly and those who don't enjoy this movie really do need a good talking to. Along with Patriot Games, this is part of an impressive set of movies which are far more entertaining than the books (perhaps thats because I'm not an avid reader) and shall keep all you viewers out there happy, if only for a short while. better than Patriot Games,but still pretty slow and boring; while i don't think this is a great movie,i do think it is better than the the last one,Jack Ryan film,Patriot Games.in Clear and Present Danger,Harrison Ford once again plays Jack Ryan.this one has a bit more intrigue than Patriot Games,and i also like the story more.it is more developed.to me,this one has a bigger scope.there is bit more urgency as well.having said that,i still think this movie is boring and slow,more often than not.Like Patriot Games,it's certainly not awful,but again i think maybe something got lost in the translation from Tom Clancy's novel.it's also almost 2 and a half hours long,and i think they could have trimmed some of it.still,it has it's good moments.for me,Clear and Present Danger is a 6/10 Role made for Ford; The gung-ho, heroic CIA intellignece offer Jack Ryan is a role made for Harrison Ford. Involved in a conspiracy within the US government that goes right to the top, he does overplay the righteous hero a bit much, but an enjoyable triller all the same. Good thriller; I think this is the best of the four Jack Ryan films. After seeing Clear and Present Danger, it is clear and present to me that director Phillip Noyce learned from his few mistakes in Patriot Games. This movie is faster, stronger, and more interesting. Harrison Ford gives another solid performance. There is less of a character to Ryan in this screenplay, but he also strikes me as more heroic. We end up rooting for him rather than just watching him. So far we have seen Ryan take on the Soviet Navy and the IRA, this time he gets involved with a Columbian drug lord. There is one potential problem with Clear and Present Danger. The movie requires just as much from the audience as it gives them. There is entertainment to be had here, but only if you pay close attention. The plot is complex, and fairly easy to get lost in. I personally don't see what is so hard about paying attention to a film, but with the action genre, I think people prefer to be entertained in a mindless eye candy kind of way rather than a thought provoking-thriller kind of way (but that's just my bias). Clear and Present Danger is still a good movie. Whether you are into the Jack Ryan novels or not, I'd recommend it. An interesting, but sometimes slow, sequence for \"Patriot Games\"...; Harrison Ford plays again the agent Jack Ryan, in this good, but a little unsuccessful, sequence for \"Patriot Games\". Directed by Philip Noyce, the same film maker who conducted the first one of the series and counting with an interesting supporting cast, \"Clear and Present Danger\" deserves to be seen, specially for a few excellent action moments (there is a particular impressive part, in which the CIA agents are caught between a shooting among the traffickers) and for the nice Harrison Ford's performance. If you didn't check the original, I recommend you to rent \"Patriot Games\" first, so you can understand the story.The bad points reside in the bad rhythm and in the confused direction by Noyce, who made a great work in \"Patriot Games\", but here accomplishes a decent, but not memorable work.Harrison Ford is a good actor and he has presence, but his character doesn't seem tough and hard enough. Not perfect, but clearly good.; Having read Tom Clancy's book, I noticed many differences with the movie (Cortez and Moira die in the movie, there is only one covert team in the movie instead of four in the book, Ritter is portrayed much more despicably in the movie, etc). I did not have a problem with most of these; the lone exception involved the death of Dan Murray in the movie. The only problem: In Clancy's later works, he becomes FBI Director Murray. So, who will conduct the seance for the next movie? Also, a language problem occurs in the film. Before I get to that, now is a good time for me to point out the show-stealers of the film, the bad guys. Yes, Harrison Ford turns in a quality performance, but Joaquim de Almeida (Cortez) and Miguel Sandoval (Ernesto Escobedo, the drug lord) are 100% believable, Escobedo as a reckless, scared bully and Cortez as a smooth-talking double-crosser who will eliminate anyone in his way. Now, on to the language problem: At the beginning of the movie, Cortez and Escobedo speak to each other in Spanish. Then, inexplicably, they resort to English for the rest of the movie. Even the guards at Escobedo's gate speak to each other in English when Ryan comes to see Escobedo. Cortez, when he yells to Escobedo's men that Ryan has killed Escobedo (it was Cortez's bodyguard), speaks to Escobedo's men in English. Message to the director: There are subtitles. You used them at the beginning of the movie. You should have continued this usage. Overall, though, the film is well-done, and I watch it whenever I catch it on television. clear and present danger background and commentary; In the 1980s, the United States, as well as many of its neighboring Latin American nations, began to feel the affects of the Columbian drug trade. Columbia was home to the Medellín and Cali drug cartels, both of which were deeply involved in the production and distribution of cocaine. The nation profited from the drug trade, as the cartels made lucrative gains by means of its unofficial protection from the Columbian government. The United States was especially accessible to the Columbian drug trade, as both coasts could be reached with relative ease. While the United States infiltrated Central American nations in attempts to tinker with the regional politics, there is no documented evidence of American presidents authorizing covert entries and operations into Columbia The action film Clear and Present Danger, deals with the issue of the American war on drugs, however, a large portion of the plot action takes place in Columbia. The film begins aboard a large white yacht with the death of an American family. The paterfamilias of the deceased family happens to be a close friend of the President of the United States. At this point, viewers are introduced to the hero, CIA analyst and family man Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford), who has been promoted to the position of Deputy Director of Intelligence, a position he inherits from his Agency mentor, Admiral James Greer (James Earl Jones). The film then moves to the Presidents issuing of an order to assemble a team of elite Hispanic commandos to infiltrate Columbia and wage a silent war on drugs. Here the audience first meets John Clark (Willem Dafoe), a mysterious black ops veteran who will train and lead the team of soldiers in Columbia. His soldiers are later dropped into the Columbian jungle where they begin their campaign with Dafoe running as their control officer from the city, reporting back to Bob Ritter, CIA's Deputy Director of Operations. The plot twist comes in the form of a man named Felix Cortez, a Cuban intelligence officer turned mercenary who serves as the intelligence officer for the cartel in the film. After a cartel meeting is bombed by an American jet, Cortez travels to the United States, where he begins to extract information through an illicit affair with the head of the FBI's secretary, Moira Wolfe. While on a romantic weekend trip, he discovers that the United States bombed the meeting, thus ending his need for the woman. He kills her and proceeds to blackmail the National Security Adviser, James Cutter, into cutting communications with the American soldiers. Jack Ryan discovers the whole operation while at the CIA, confronts Ritter, and then goes to Columbia to save them. When he arrives, he meets up with John Clark, who, under the belief that Ryan discontinued the communications, ties him up and nearly kills him. The two men then embark on a journey to find the soldiers, and eventually find Ding Chavez, hiding alone near a jungle stream since his comrades have all been shot or captured. These three then storm Cortez' compound to rescue the other soldiers and make their subsequent escape. While Clear and Present Danger is an entertaining film, it wildly strays from the novel on which it is based. Tom Clancy's storyline is much more in depth then the plot line of the movie. Some stark differences between the two include the deaths of Dan Murray and Moira Wolfe. In the film, Dan Murray is killed on a trip to Columbia that nearly results in the death of Jack Ryan as well. Dan Murray, according to Clancy's novel, is simply an up-and-coming FBI agent and friend of Ryan's. The FBI personality murdered in Columbia in the novel is Emil Jacobs, Director of the FBI. In the movie, Moira Wolfe's apparent death violently betrays the novel, for not only does she live, the novel ends with Ms. Wolfe traveling to Guantanamo Bay to see her \"lover\" Cortez, being escorted into the prison gates and eventually handed over to Cuban authorities. Driven a Ford lately?; CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER (1994) *** Harrison Ford, Willem Dafoe, Anne Archer, James Earl Jones, Joquim DeAlmeida, Ann Magnuson, Henry Czerny, Donald Moffat, Harris Yulin, Miguel Sandoval.  Superb adaptation of Tom Clancy's high-tech thriller with CIA analyst extraordinairre Jack Ryan (Ford reprising his role from \"Patriot Games\") up to his neck in a double-crossing cat and mouse set-up involving South American drug cartels and political machinations.  Intelligent script and some true edge-of-your seat moments. A so-so film that's worth watching.; Third installment of the Jack Ryan series takes place as Ryan (Harrison Ford) who takes over for his ailing mentor, Greer (James Earl Jones) and investigates the murders of a U.S. businessman (and his family) who was a friend of the current President (Donald Moffat) and had secret ties to a Colombian drug lord (Miguel Sandoval).  Ryan is aware that a fellow CIA employee, Cutter (Henry Czerny in a devilish performance) throws Ryan into the middle of a cover-up after a small band of U.S. soldiers and numerous innocent civilians have been killed.  Ford is okay here as Ryan, but Willem Dafoe (\"Shadow of the Vampire\") manages to steal the show as John Clark, a clever and reliable field operative who originally thinks that Ryan found out about his small operation in Colombia and pulled the plug on it.  The film becomes fun to watch in the second half as Ryan, Clark, and Chavez (Raymond Cruz), a sniper bail out the remaining members of Clark's squad out of Bogota.  Overall, \"Clear and Present Danger\" is a so-so film that's worth watching. Ryan is the best Ford Character ever; Wow i'm vote no 5000 a lot of people must love this movie too. Harrison Ford has played some great characters over the last 25 years but Jack Ryan rocks. As far as Tom Clancy stories go the Jack Ryan ones are the greatest. I just hope that more Ryan movies are made, they deserve to be... I rated this as a 10/10 movie only because the chart does not have any higher scores. Fair portrayal of the book; This is, in my view, the closes so far of the film adaptations of the Tom Clancy novels. I write this having recently read a precis of the new movie based on The Sum of all Fears in which terrorists try to cause a nuclear war between the USA and Russia. In the new movie, two bombs are released, one in chechnya and another in Baltimore.  The book was overall a very technical affair which admitedly would be difficult to translate to the screen. But enough of that, excepting a number of missing sub-plots from the book, clear and present danger follows closely the war against drugs and an illegal invasion by the USA into Columbia.  It misses off the wonderful helicopter finale of the book, but does a good job of capturing the audience. The car ambush is a particular high point that you'll want to see again and again! A good movie, but not as good as the original.; CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER It was good, but not as good as Patriot Games. The film went on for far too long. It was nearly 3 hours long and I felt it didn't need to be that long. The story has nothing to do with the original movie, which I liked. It was just the same characters in another situation. The original cast returned for this film which is always a good sign. I hate it when someone makes a sequel for a movie but changes the actors for one reason or another. It just makes it better when the original cast returns. Harrison Ford returns as Jack Ryan. He, as always, does a great job. I loved the new cast members to this movie too... Willem Dafoe played John. He was convincing in his role. But I think the actor I am growing to like more and more is Joaquim de Almeida. I have seen him in a few movies now and he has been brilliant in all of them. He really does play a brilliant bad guy. The action in this film is great. There are a lot of really good scenes where the action, explosions and suspense is great. This is another good 90s action film. It's one of those films that you have no idea who to trust... it is better not to trust anyone. I really did like this film, but it was on for too long and it was not as good as the original film. It would have been good if they made a few more of these with this character, just as long as Harrison returned as Jack. He could have been the new James Bond. I will give this film 6 out of 10. It is a shame there were no more.

Well, not as much as before, but, uh, still... nevermind; Special Collector's Edition review. I haven't read the novel. The first Ford attempt came off as more his movie than a properly done one based on a book by a solid writer. This gets closer to a healthy mix of the two. There is still action, and it's well-done, but it doesn't feel like it's struggling with the political thriller aspects for the spotlight(not only because of the considerably lesser amount). The pacing is pretty good, this is never boring. The plot is interesting, and I'd say the Clancy feel is a stronger presence in this than in its immediate predecessor(hey, you can go elsewhere for a straight Harrison flick, no?). The acting is relatively solid all the way. The characters are well-written and credible, for the most part. The editing and cinematography tend to be nice in this. The special effects leave little to be desired. The dialog has memorable lines, like the first in the series. The language does have some harsh words, but fewer(not to be confused with milder) than in the previous effort. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of the franchise, Tom Clancy and/or Harrison Ford. 7/10 Better than Patriot Games!; If you've read my comment on Patriot Games(you can by clicking my name above), you'll read I was a bit dissapointed in the film. The book by Tom Clancy was great, but I thought the movie was a bit slow at times, and boring. However, I still like Patriot Games. Clear and Present Danger on the other hand, I thought was even better. It's a bit more interesting, and although it also has some slow times in the film, some great action sequences make up for it. And as always in all Clancy books and films, the climax has great action sequences. Rent this movie if you haven't seen it. Watch it back to back with Patriot Games, and decide for yourself which you like better. 3.5/5 stars(.5 more than I gave Patriot Games, so I BARELY like this more, but just enough).-MovieCritic2003 The Old Potomac Two-Step; This was Harrison Ford's second outing as Jack Ryan following \"Patriot Games\" from two years earlier. (The character was also played by Alec Baldwin in \"The Hunt for Red October\" and Ben Affleck in \"The Sum of all Fears\", neither of which I have seen). The plot concerns a covert war being waged by American troops against drug traffickers in Colombia authorised by the President and his aides without the approval of Congress. Ryan, who has been promoted to Deputy Director of the CIA following the death of his mentor Admiral Greer, has to try and uncover the truth, which puts him into danger as the bad guys try to cover their tracks. \"Clear and Present Danger\" is in many ways a different film from \"Patriot Games\", and both have their strengths and weaknesses. \"Patriot Games\" was a more straightforward film. Although the villains were Irish terrorists there was no serious attempt to analyse, or make a statement about, the Northern Ireland situation; Irish terrorism was simply used as the basis for an exciting action thriller. \"Clear and Present Danger\" is a longer film than \"Patriot Games\"- at nearly two and a half hours it probably exceeds the optimum length for a thriller- and with more talk and less action, although there are some good action sequences. Those that stand out are the \"computer duel\" between Ryan and Ritter and the scenes where Ryan travels to Colombia to try and rescue the American soldiers who have been abandoned by the President in an attempt to try and prevent the truth coming out. It is a more political film about corruption in high places and the misuse of authority, reminiscent of Watergate and possibly also the Iran/Contra affair. There has been some debate on this board about whether President Bennett is a villain, although to me it seems quite clear that the film-makers intended to portray him as one. His decision to send troops into Colombia is motivated less by a desire to combat the international drugs trade than by a desire to avenge a personal friend who has been murdered on the orders of Ernesto Escobedo, a powerful drug lord from whom he had stolen money. (The surname Escobedo suggests that this character was based upon the real-life drug baron Pablo Escobar). He orders soldiers into action and then abandons them to their fate out of political expediency. There is also the question of the legality of his actions. The film takes the view that they are clearly illegal because they violate the War Powers Act 1973. The constitutionality of this Act, in fact, has been denied- not least by every President since its passage- but none of those Presidents have ever attempted to challenge it in the Supreme Court. Harrison Ford is once again very good as Ryan, perhaps even better than he was in \"Patriot Games\". Ford is not as versatile as some actors, but he does have his strengths, and playing solid, decent and reliable heroes is one of them, displayed not only in his Jack Ryan films but also in films like \"Witness\", \"The Fugitive\", \"K-19 The Widowmaker\" and the Indiana Jones series. Ryan's function in this film is not only as its action hero but also as its moral anchor. He is the man who can be relied upon to stand up for honour and decency, the man who, unlike officials from the President downwards, refuses to dance the \"Old Potomac Two-Step\" of concealment and corruption. (The phrase is taken from a key scene at the end of the film, when he refuses the President's blandishments to cover up the scandal). Political conspiracy thrillers have becomes something of a Hollywood cliché ever since Watergate, but this is one of the better ones.</td>\n",

Zealand by an Australian, Strange Behaviour stars Dan Shor as teenager Pete Brady who unwisely volunteers as a test subject for an experimental drug, in order to raise some much-needed cash. What Pete doesn't know, however, is that the scientist who has developed the treatment is a few sandwiches short of a picnic, and is turning his human lab-rats into knife-wielding assassins. 'Strange' is a very fitting word for this early 80s movie, which opts to buck the trends of the daygratuitous gore and nudityto deliver a very unique horror experience. Although the basic premise of a mad scientist using human guinea pigs to carry out nefarious acts might be considered fairly routine material for the genre, this film proves to be far removed from other similarly themed fare, and totally unlike the mainstream horrors of the era: there is a small helping of nasty violence in Strange Behaviour, but it is director Michael Laughlin's distinctly offbeat style and the promise of much weirdness that has lead fans of cult/drive-in movies to seek out the film. An impromptu formation dance routine at a 50s themed party, set to the sound of Lou Christie's \"Lighting Strikes\"; a psycho bitch scientist (played by Fiona Lewis) who is handy with a syringe; a gratuitous toenail clipping scene; Jimmy Olsen from Superman in crap fancy dress; Louise Fletcher NOT playing an evil cow; a creepy kid in a rubber mask and a murderous fat girl: it's all very quirky, and yet, somehow, it worksat least until the lacklustre final act, which fails to keep the levels of lunacy sufficiently high, and which is capped by a very abrupt ending that sorely needs a clever twist or suitably bizarre revelation to round off things in a satisfactory manner. Credentials high, however this low-budget shocker never quite takes off...; Australian-New Zealand-US co-production about modern-day teenagers in a small town \"outside of Chicago\" who come under the influence of a nefarious scientific team conducting paid experiments in their laboratory-fortress; the resident chief of police, harboring a grudge against the government-funded operation since the mysterious death of his wife, investigates. Director Michael Laughlin, working from a thin script by Bill Condon and himself, is very apt at creating atmosphere and mood, and the tension which slowly develops rests entirely upon these attributes (the characters and dialogue being of little consequence). His handling is, at times, uncomfortably physical, yet the violent sequences are paced in a realistically awkward manner--as if in a tumultuous dream-state. Laughlin takes it all quite seriously, with no camp overtones, though he doesn't give his first-rate cast an opportunity to do any real acting (Louise Fletcher, speaking with a light, frivolous twang, is particularly frittered away). Still, the look of the picture, the music by Tangerine Dream, and some of the horrific images are unique and memorable. *1/2 from **** Overall quite a confusing entry; A string of strange deaths in a small-town lead the sheriff to a rather obscure mystery he was involved with years earlier that has resulted in several youths running rampage over the residents that may have a more ghastly ulterior motive. Not really too sure what to make of this one, as there's a lot to work with that really shines through. The initial part of the murder mystery is pretty decent with a couple fun and admittedly enjoyable stalking scenes that definitely give off a tense vibe from time-to-time, and the finale offers some pretty interesting revelations that are definitely unnerving, but the fact that the film is just so slow-going and dragged-out that it really loses a lot of it's steam just by dragging out the investigation and doing nothing with what should've been a tense scene beforehand. Add to that a low number of kills which result in a tame amount of blood, a lot of broad comedy that really isn't funny and shouldn't be in the movie and a far more complex plot that normal really doom this one significantly. Rated R: Language and Violence. One of the truly great, overlooked, horror movies of the last 22 years.; Chock full of haunting images, chilling murders, and good performances this slow, laconic but amazingly effective horror flick has stayed with me since I saw it when it was originally released.  The film is best in its portrayal of teen life in a small college town in the midwest (though it was shot in New Zealand).  Taking it's cue from there, the film moves along at a leisurely, but ultimately disquieting pace revealing that all is not so sleepy and calm in this rural environment. Co-written by Academy Award-winner Bill Condon (\"GODS AND MONSTERS\") the story shows remarkable intelligence and wit in the vein of some of the best Roman Polanski flicks (e.g. \"THE TENANT\" and \"REPULSION\"). Best if seen in the movie theater to appreciate it's glorious widescreen landscapes.  Wish this picture was out on DVD. Something funny is going on; This came out during the slasher boom around the early '80s, except \"Strange Behavior\" dodged the norm from the infamous films of the heyday such as \"Halloween,\" \"Friday the 13th\" and \"Prom Night,\" as there isn't one killer at large and the murderers aren't cold-blooded psychopaths with twisted pasts, even if their bizarre motivations make them act like maniacal blood fiends. The continually annoyed and stressed looking local Chief of Police--who never dons a traditional uniform as everything is usually hunky dory--must investigate these mysterious deaths. The strange part is the audience hardly ever witnesses the small town in the grip of fear. Some innocent gets sadistically killed and others go about their lives as if the grass is always greener on the other side with frivolous humor and their regular routines intact. This is the type of plot where there's an \"elephant in the room\" and only one man detects it, as this focuses on a connection between the Chief, experimenters at the local college and the Chief's late wife fitting right smack in the middle. The story thickens when the Chief's son opposes his stubborn father to make decisions as his own man but gets ensnared by the affiliation. \"Strange Behavior\" throws in some distractions to lighten the load from watching violence and blood, such as a subplot between the Chief's son and the newly met, easy-going, blond secretary, as well as the chipper step mother who wants to fill the role of late wife. This takes cues from \"Halloween\" type killings meets \"Altered States\"-esque mad science meets \"Bond\"-like villains meets small town TV mystery/sitcom/love connection. This had the makings to be an esteemed film, though the filmmaker's ambitions were aiming sky high in an attempt to appease a viewer with scenes of the surreal and macabre, as well as the person who wants established, down-to-earth characters, though both sides bump heads to compete and this hardly feels steadily creepy or like it could actually happen as it doesn't fully come together and keep one on the edge of their seat. Even a potential for one last scare wasn't capitalized on. This could have learned from the weirdness that \"Dead & Buried\" had: to keep the atmosphere alive by feeding throughout. (Also submitted on http://fromblacktoredfilmreviews.blogspot.com/) A gripping, effective and stylish chiller!; I first saw this inventive and well-produced thriller in the mid-nineties via a full-screen Rhino Video cassette I bought--this is not a film that is easy to find in most video stores (I currently have it on DVD and, I must say, it is like a new film, immaculate and widescreen in all of its Panavision glory). Well, when I saw this deliciously tongue-in-cheek flick, I fell in love with it instantly. The direction by Michael Laughlin was tight and effective; Bill Condon's script was clever, funny and twisty; Louis Horvath's provocative and incredibly colorful cinematography was impressive; the Tangerine Dream score was stunning and dream-like; and, in the lead, Michael Murphy, towering and unforgettable, was both brilliantly subtle and medium cool, as well as intense and humanly believable. Along with fine supporting turns from Louis Fletcher, Fiona Lewis, Arthur Dignam, Scott Brady and Charles Lane, the whole film is quite satisfying. It's hard to describe this film in a few short, concise words, so I choose to say that \"Strange Behavior\" is like \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" meets \"Halloween\" meets \"Blue Velvet.\" It's an atmospheric, genre-busting, deliciously quirky slice of cinematic cleverness. A must for genuine horror film enthusiasts. 'Dead Kids' is dead good! One of my favourite horror movies of the late 70s/early 80s.; In the late 70s/early 80s during the Australian film \"renaissance\", when historical dramas like 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' and 'Gallipoli' were all the rage, a producer named Antony Ginnane attempted to go against the tide and get some thrillers and horror movies made Down Under. He dreamed of being Australia's Roger Corman. Sadly it wasn't to be but hats off to him for helping movies like 'Patrick', 'Thirst' and 'Turkey Shoot' get to the big screen! 'Dead Kids' (a.k.a. 'Strange Behavior') is another underrated movie from this period that he co-produced. This time Ginnane and friends went to New Zealand instead of Australia, something to do with union hiccups I believe. The movie was actually filmed in Auckland, but set in the US with a mostly American cast, including Dan Shor ('Wise Blood'), Michael Murphy ('Manhattan'), Louise Fletcher ('One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'), Marc McLure ('Superman'), and Dey Young ('Rock'n'Roll High School'). Also appearing were the British born Fiona Lewis ('The Fury') and Aussie character actor Arthur Dignam ('The Devil's Playground'), who plays the enigmatic Dr Le Sangel, a role originally intended for Klaus Kinski. As well as a great cast this movie is noteworthy because it was directed by Michael Laughlin, the producer of Monte Hellman's 70s road classic 'Two-Lane Blacktop', and co-written by Laughlin and Bill Condon, who went on the write and direct the excellent James Whale biopic 'Gods And Monsters'. There are two outstanding bits in 'Dead Kids' which anyone who watches it will never forget: the syringe-in-the-eyeball scene, and the party sequence with a bunch of kids dancing to the Lou Christie oldie \"Lightning Strikes\". Music buffs will also appreciate the score from Tangerine Dream, and Aussies will get a kick out of (briefly) hearing The Boys Next Door's post-punk classic \"Shivers\" on the soundtrack. 'Dead Kids' is one of the my favourite horror movies of the late 70s/early 80s, a golden age filled with some very inventive and original shockers e.g. 'Evil Dead', 'Phantasm', 'Dead & Buried', 'Basket Case', to name a few. Eli Roth's super-hyped 'Cabin Fever' claimed to be inspired by some of these movies but totally missed the point in my opinion. Forget Roth, go for the real thing like this, which is both more entertaining AND scarier. \"I can't help you.  I don't have a gun\"; This takes place in a small mid-western town in Illinois (even though it was shot in New Zealand!). Police chief Jim Brady (Michael Murphy) has his hands full with a sudden rash of killings--someone is stabbing people to death and is targeting teenagers. His son Pete (Dan Shor) takes part in some experimental behavioral tests at the local university for some extra money. They're run by creepy Gwen Parkinson (Fiona Lewis) and might have something to do with the murders... This is far from perfect. The script is pretty silly with terrible dialogue; the film is grainy (even in a remastered print) with bad sound; Murphy is just terrible; Louise Fletcher is wasted and the direction and editing are off (to say the least). Still, this film works. It has some pretty good acting by Shor (who is first shown completely nude--back view only) and Dey Young and an excellent performance by Lewis. It has a creepy feel to it, has an excellent score by Tangerine Dream and has a few highlights (especially one particular murder sequence and a great sequence at a costume party where everybody dances to \"Lightning Strikes\"). Also it's pretty restrained in its use of blood and gore. This is no unsung masterpiece but a good solid thriller that deserves some recognition. Due to lousy distribution this disappeared but is available on video and DVD. Worth seeing. Trivia: The opening victim is writer Bill Condon. interesting and entertaining; dead kids is very well made and unusual addition to horror cinema. it is an australian/new zealend production, and was made with the intention to sell it to an american market. so you get a film that looks very much like an american film, is shot and crafted like an american film with american actors (who are often better than any australian actor that gets into this kind of film, neighbours and home and away are rarely good casting grounds) but the script has a definite australian feel to it. from the odd, sly humour, to the way it deals with the murders and the almost complete lack of morality in the film. not to say it is immoral, but themes of morality never come into it, which is not often seen in american horror. for the most part, it is wonderfully directed, one that has to be seen in widescreen to appreciate. however, the murders are somewhat lacklustre, they are directed with very little bite. it is obvious that the director has no idea of hot to show \"action\". most of the time it does not drastically effect the overall film as this is not a typical slasher film. in a few scenes however, this \"relaxed\" view of violence heightens the horror, such as the final murder and the \"human experiments\" carried out on the main character. as mentioned above, the script is quite interesting and entertaining. however, there is a 2 minute ending tacked on after the final showdown which drastically decreases the power of the film. while not being a classic, it is still one of the better and more interesting horror films of the 80s that deserves a far wider audience than it has recieved. Strange indeed!; Known most everywhere (outside the US) as DEAD KIDS, this is the film by which \"strange flicks\" are measured. To some extent, comparable to MY BLOODY VALENTINE in as much as what we have here is majorly weird goings-on in a small township. You would never pick that this was filmed in New Zealand - it LOOKS like a small Nebraska township with a Pontiac Le Mans, Thunderbird, Chevy and assorted 60's Yank tanks on view as well as your all-american college dudes. Only the dedicated viewer may pick up the cinematography and Tangerine Dream soundtrack as revealing its New Zealand ancestry - very reminiscent at times of BATTLE TRUCK! Actually in large part an Australian endeavour also - witness Arthur Dignam as Dr Weird-In-The -extreme! Agreed, as a slasher movie it doesn't cut it....as a thinking man's thriller it never rates. As an 80's time-capsule..its a winner (\"Friday the 13th\" vintage) What makes the film, is its very weirdness and the musical score from Tangerine Dream. Those shots of the car moving along the town's main drag are utterly cool and absorbing.  For some reason also the fancy dress party and the kids dancing to Lou Christie's great 60's hit, \"Lighting strikes,\" just hits a nerve somewhere down memory lane. Interesting also to see McClure as a zappy college student. Some of you may recall him as reporter-pup Jimmy Olsen in the four-part SUPERMAN series as well as SUPERGIRL Not great by a long shot but way left field enough to stake a claim to horror immortality. Experimenting on the younger generation.; Galesberg, Illinois is a sleepy, small town where brutally strange murders are occurring. Sheriff John Brady believes it has something to with some secret experiments being performed on the local teenagers by a collage's psych department led by Dr Gwen Parkinson. Also unknowingly to John, his son Pete has signed up to the program in the hope the money he earns off it, would go a long way for him getting into his preferred collage. Slashers hey. God love 'em! Well this was around the same time when the craze for it was huge in the horror genre. But that in mind, while I found the New Zealand/Australian co-production \"Dead Kids\" to follow the conventional methods and clichés. It still manages to hold its own within the sub-genre because of its quirky charm, realistic touch and overall edgy style that sets it apart from many rancid entries. There's something quite compelling about it all, even though the fractured story could have been far more fulfilling in its matter. Mainly it comes off because the sterling performances are very convincing in setting up their characters, the story's progression is unforeseeable with a unique premise (that could be lifted right out of those early horror 30's and 40's features of mad scientists) and Michael Laughlin's pastel direction has a freshly polish tinge about it that comes off very well in some superbly choreographed scenes that are stylishly unusual (loved the inspired party scene with Lou Christie's \"Lighting Strikes\"), unnervingly creepy (the scarecrow scene) or just plain suspenseful. If there's one downer to Laughlin's direction though, it's that the most of the imaginatively nasty death/or attack scenes are executed rather sloppily and can look silly. At least they were grisly and had some splatter to spare, but in the long run it wasn't trying to be pointlessly gory or wanting to up the body count. It's a moody atmosphere that slowly engages the viewer with its mysteriously offbeat vibe and nail biting jolts created from its wholesome reality. Streaming through the script is a welcome slice of humour that has the right sense towards its material. The production is that of low budget, but it doesn't show up prominently with many professional elements working in favour on the project. While the film is set in US, it was actually filmed in New Zealand with a mostly American cast. The picture-perfect setting authentically comes across and makes good of the atmosphere. Louis Horvath's wide scope Panavison cinematography is gorgeously framed with such hypnotic verve and the Tangerine Dream's effectively airy music score has that alienating awe to it. Australian producer Antony I. Ginnane backed this one and has some other great films under his belt that he managed to get the screen, like \"Turkey Shoot\", \"Patrick\", \"Harlequin\" and \"The Survivor\". Michael Laughlin would go on to direct \"Strange Invaders\" and screenwriter Bill Condon would be recognised for penning and directing \"Gods and Monsters (1998)\". Though, he first kicked of his flair for direction with effectively minor southern Gothic shocker \"Sister, Sister (1987)\". The performances are particularly fine. Dan Shor is ideal as the Pete and Dey Young has a very appealing presence on screen. Michael Murphy holds it together with an admirably focused turn as sheriff Brady. Fiona Louis really eats it up as the icy Dr Parkinson. Making up the rest in bit parts are Marc McClure, Johnny Guitar, Charles Lane, Arthur Dignam and very warm-hearted Louise Fletcher. A definite oddity that works a treat in what it sets out to do. Recommended. Review from a kid of the 80's; The 80's is when I went to college and gained my independence. I also own alot of my movie watching experiences to the wonderful \"Z\" Channel which was a staple in Los Angeles when I moved out here. The \"Z\" Channel had the best films and the best way of showing them. I got to see \"Strange Behavior\" on \"Z\" Channel's yearly \"Halloween Fest\", a week long showing of films from all over the world. Not one digital/satellite/cable select movie channel today programs what \"Z\" had done on Halloween. They continue to show the same old standards \"movie\" when there are wacked out little films like this one that can be viewed as well. This is not a horror masterpiece by any standards but for the 80's it was low budget horror. The way I first saw it made it more interesting to see which is why it interested me and I liked it at the time. (By the way, I haven't seen it since!) It was gory more than scary and watching the experiments on these kids were something. Sometimes timing is everything and seeing this film on Halloween Night on the \"Z\" Channel in 1983 was pretty cool, even though by todays standards, this movie may be a dud. So I say, if you're an adult and want to add some \"different\" movies in your Halloween party fare, this might do the trick. Other than that, this film may seem really dated and cheap to you. A fascinating offbeat horror movie.; Don't let the unpleasant title put you off, this is an excellent little movie that I actually found quite scary. The acting is top class especially from Dan Shor and Michael Murphy who star. Louise Fletcher is also on top form and all three bring a realistic almost 'cinema veritie' feel to the proceedings. The film works because of Michael laughlins direction that develops the film on many levels. On the one hand there is lots of atmosphere and a suspenseful intensity that builds up to the films climax yet Laughlin also concentrates on character development and relationships giving us insights in to Chief Bradys (Michael Murphy) mysterious past and the close father/son relationship him and Pete (Dan Shor) have. The film also pays close attention to small town life. In this small Louisiana town everyone knows everyone there are lots of nice little touches by Laughlin to point this out. Laughlins direction also has a humorous edge to it and the good acting adds to this. There is one incredibly surreal scene in the movie at a party where all the 'party-goers' start dancing in unison! They are all in 50's style fancy dress and dance in a hyperbolic 50's fashion! Although it is hard to decipher Laughlins motives here this scene seems incredibly inspired to me personally. Although some scenes in this film are quite shocking I cannot comment on the amount of gore in this film because I have only seen the UK 18 cert release which has been cut considerably and panned and scanned. If only there was a widescreen version available I for one would instantly snap it up! Strange Behavior (interesting plo - BAD MOVIE); I just got it on DVD because I read of all the positive hype, and loved movies like \"Stepford \"Wifes\", \"Desturbing Behavior\" and \"The Mansurain Candidate\", and I hoped to find more movies in this genre. I stumbled over this movie, and though I had found what I was looking for because of the good reviews and interesting plot, but I was really WRONG! First of all, this movie has a really slow pace! You can deal with that is the acting and the atmosphere is good, but none of these were good. There was just about no atmosphere at all, you never get a shock or feel scared or even interested in the characters. The Good: Kid with scare mask makes a kill. (Really great mask!) Nice filming while riding the car. (camera on backseat) Plot with potential The Bad: only 5 kills in the entire movie, and only one is interesting. No interest in the characters hardly any focus on the experiments/plot Lots of random talk, no continuation in the movie No atmosphere, you feel nothing but boredom while watching this movie Boring surroundings Boring sound side of the movie Conclusion: Not worth watching, even if your a horror fan. There is no reason for watching this movie, unless your a major fan of someone in it :-S Don't know who that should be! Could have been stranger \n",
       " AND better.; Feel free to call me a sick and disturbed individual, but I have a weakness for horror movies in which the bloodthirsty murderers are young children and/or movies in which young kids are being killed off. So you can image, since one of the a.k.a title of this movie is \"Dead Kids\", I was very much intrigued and eager to trace it down. Browsing through the other user comments, it looks as if the film has quite a solid cult following and many fans even refer to it as a genuinely underrated and neglected gem of early 80's horror. Personally, I wouldn't go so far and call it that, but it definitely is a worthwhile sleeper, featuring several moments of effective creepiness, an overall sinister atmosphere and a handful of delightfully insane characters. Actually, the only thing that keeps me from rating \"Strange Behavior\" as a neglected gem myself is the rather mundane and unoriginal plot as well as the disappointing amount of explicit gore. The script  courtesy of Bill Condon (\"Gods and Monsters\")  contains a few ingenious ideas and neat touches, but it generally is a run-of-the-mill shocker about a mad scientist whose behaviorist experiments are causing the youthful guinea pigs to turn into sadistic & unaware murderers. \"Strange Behavior\" is set in a quiet little town near Chicago (although filmed in New Zealand), where four young citizens are brutally killed within a short period of time. The police remain clueless regarding the identity & motivation of the culprit(s), until inspector John Brady discovers that the local psychiatric center pays students in exchange for experimenting on them. Brady had unpleasant encounters with the eerie Dr. Le Sange in the past  and assumed he was dead  but the nightmare starts all over again, especially when his own son appears to be involved in the experiments. The finale is a tad bit predictable and déjà-vu, but the earlier killing sequences are extremely well staged and macabre. There also is an unforgettably unsettling syringe-in-the-eyeball sequence that made me feel uncomfortable for a second. Definitely the best shot in its type, along with the similar moment in  and that's a true gem  \"Dead & Buried\". The soundtrack is quite awesome and there's even room for a slight bit of black humor, provided by Charles Lane as the elderly cop. When the authorities finally receive a lead stating that a mildly obese young girl committed one of the murders, he goes to the local high school in order to collect the files of all the female students. When asked what they're for, he cheerfully replies: \"We're gonna find the fat ones!\" Priceless\n",
       " \"Strange Behavior\" is a fun horror film that does deserve a little more appreciation, but the basic plot surely had more potential. Nonetheless, it's worth checking out. Better than expected, but...; FINALLY, a passable horror. Although, I'll remember it more for a stunning I Dream Of Jeannie costume in the fancy dress party scene, than for the actual content. Also, I have no idea why this is rated 18 since the murders are more comical than gruesome, and the most horrific thing on displays are the bad 80's hairdos. Still, Fiona Lewis's performance as the most ruthless female medical worker since Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is noteworthy (Oddly enough, the woman who played Nurse Ratched, Louise Fletcher, pops up here in a completely different role) and there is a nice little twist near the end. Alas, the unrealistic stabbings and the presence of breathing corpses prevent it from ever being scary, and the tactic of renaming it DEAD KIDS in the UK just reeks of desperation.It's perfectly watchable,and miles better than some of the dross I've seen of this genre recently, but my wait for a truly good horror this year goes on Not bad, but not very good.; SB is definitely not a reminder of the teen slasher/slasher runs loose at camp/sorority house serial killer films of the 80s. The violence is quite mild (with the possible exception of a certain bathroom scene), there's no mystery about who the killer is or why they're killing, and there's no gratuitous nudity. (In fact, I don't recall any nudity at all.) The plot, which revolves around the ability of mad scientist types to remotely control the behavior of teens and to make them commit murder, is hackneyed and dated even by the standards of the early 80s. The viewer is let in on the plot fairly early in the film. Combined with the low overall body count (and some inexplicable gaps in the storyline,) the film can be both boring and puzzling. Several well-known actors put in obligatory roles, but only Louise Fletcher seems embarrassed by her marginal and insignificant character. Fiona Lewis plays...well, Fiona Lewis. Charles Lane appears in the movie, but we're never sure exactly why. Dan Shor is a somewhat odd and inappropriate choice as the teen lead. He was 25 when the movie was made and while this is not uncommon in casting teens, he is not able to pull it off. Besides being a couple inches shorter than the romantic interest, he walks around like a zombie BEFORE he's zombified and his face makes him look like he's just come off a three-day bender. From the right angle, he'll remind you of William Katt, but with none of Katt's charm or boyish sense of humor. One distinctive touch to this movie is the odd little scene that serves as a coda. The scene does not really serve any purpose...there are no revelations...no suggestions that \"the evil\" will return...no surprises or shocks...no final resolution of the fate of Fiona Lewis's character. It's just filler stuck on the end. In spite of all the film's flaws, it is fairly well-made and the NZ scenery does stand in well for Illinois. Overall, it's quite competent, just not memorable. Strictly for those who enjoy such movies, as there is little else to recommend it other than the genre. A sadly overlooked sci-fi slasher (See This Slasher #4); A couple of teens looking to grab a few extra bucks sign up to be experimented on by the scientists at the local university. Unfortunately, something strange is going on that will cost the lives of more than a few of the town's teens: The experiments are causing them to turn into violent killers! Though it starts out a bit shaky with one of the least thrilling death scenes ever, Strange Behavior quickly becomes one of the most entertaining and enjoyable slashers I've ever seen. Using a great blend of comedy and horror, Michael Laughlin creates a film that is quite tragically forgotten or overlooked when consulting the huge library of late 70s/early 80s horrors. There isn't much to complain about since almost everything is done surprisingly well. The writing & direction work very well, which results in a film that works on several different levels: horror, sci-fi, thriller, and comedy. The acting is pretty good for a teen film, not over-the-top or cheesy like one would expect, but still not great. There are a few good songs on the soundtrack from Lou Christie and Pop Mechanix. The conclusion is cool and a bit unexpected, though it seemed rather rushed. But, it all comes together to be a very, very watchable slasher. In the end, if this film sounds like it would be enjoyable. . . you will find it enjoyable. It's the kind of movie that was made for one thing: entertainment, and it succeeds. I'll now be checking in on the second installment of the failed trilogy: Strange Invaders. Unfortunately, the third installment was never produced. Never too late, Endeavour Productions (well, for you it is). *wink wink* Obligatory Slasher Elements: - Violence/Gore: Well, there isn't much violence (most of it is off-screen), but there's some good gore. The 'smaller' gore scenes are done well, but some of the more extravagant ones aren't so great. - Sex/Nudity: Sadly, no. - Cool Killer(s): Yes, very. Because the experiments cause the OTHERS to be killers, it made it far more interesting. - Scares/Suspense: There are some jump scares and some good tension (especially during the experiments), but it wasn't overly suspenseful. - Mystery: Yeah, there is. . . origins of the medical facility & all that. - Awkward Dance Scene: There is a totally rockin' costume party complete with an Adam West-style Batman and a tuxedo t-shirt. . . and all the great choreographed 80s moves none of us want to remember. - Classic Quote of the Film: ''We're going to find the fat ones!\" Final verdict: 8/10. See this slasher! -AP3- Strange Behavior; From director Michael Laughlin(the underrated STRANGE INVADERS with Paul LeMat)and writer/producer Bill Condon(director of GODS AND MONSTERS), shot in New Zealand substituting a town in Illinois miles out of Chicago, comes this rather interesting mad-scientist \"killer college kids\" movie about how neurological experiments, which require volunteers(students wanting to make a couple hundred), could be linked to a series of sadistic knife stabbings; differing methods as to how they are performed leaves policeman John Brady(Michael Murphy;MANHATTAN)baffled to the point that he must call up Chicago for some assistance. Brady has a history with the scientist, Dr. Le Sangel(Arthur Dignam), whose work is the template used by Professor Gwen Parkinson(Fiona Lewis;DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN)in conducting her behavioral experiments which includes a certain type of drug, a pill called PRL-B58, which supposedly awakens a part of the brain we don't normally use. In fact this drug in actuality allows Parkinson(or someone else maybe)to puppet human guinea pigs into committing homicides. Brady's boy, Pete(Dan Shor), is Parkinson's latest victim and might be used to kill his dad. Brady's wife died he believes at the will of Le Sangel for leaving the scientist and his research project. Brady and Le Sangel become mortal enemies, although it's believed the scientist was killed. With Louise Fletcher as Barbara Moorehead, Brady's love interest, Dey Young(the snobby saleswoman who hurts Julia Roberts' feelings in PRETTY WOMAN)as Pete's girlfriend, and Marc McClure(Jimmy Olsen in the SUPERMAN movies)as Pete's pal who convinces him to be involved in Parkinson's seemingly innocent experiment for $200. The knife murders are quite potent including one scene where a mother finds her son in the bathroom, his hand sliced off, the murderer(a robotic girl absent any free will of her own)returning to not only finish the job on him but pursues her as well. I think the cinematography(by Louis Horvath)and hypnotic Tangerine Dream score boost this rather cold thriller. Great cast that really never quite rises above the material for some reason..maybe they didn't receive the proper motivation because the performances come off as stiff and unconvincing. Michael Murphy has certainly been better than he is here. One of the few instances where the filmmakers attempt to \"doll up\" Louise Fletcher. Eerie thriller that is disturbing and very graphic.; Experiments at a local lab are connected to a series of brutal murders in a small midwestern town.  Confusing but effective chiller, made on a low budget, has a cast of mostly unknowns, but it all comes together.  It does leave some uneasiness, and does offer some shocking scenes that, while not elaborate, are still pretty gory.  It is a very disturbing, surreal experience, with solid suspense and a good ending.  It feels like you're having a bad dream: a nightmarish place, faceless persons, creepy enough to want to get out of, but intriguing enough to want to stay and see what happens.  Strange indeed. \"We're going to find the FAT ones!\"; Definitely a film with its own personality, Strange Behavior can best be appreciated by those that remember when films didn't require fast editing to appease the short attention spans of MTV-weened young'ns. With lines like the one about the \"fat ones\" delivered by the great Charles Lane and a vision of a 1950s style small town set in the \"present\" (something director Michael Laughlin and writer Bill Condon again brought us in Strange Invaders), the film was a splendid hybrid of old fashioned Twilight Zone ambiance and the fun, then-fresh exuberance of New Wave music and sheer sense of FUN. To top off the great mix: a Tangerine Dream score. Mad Scientists, teens partying (but in the pre-MTV, pre-home computer kind of ways), mysterious killings, and....strange behavior! Oh, and the kind of impromptu group dance that was a heck of a lot more fun than the big dance scene in Footloose! Where else would a sudden dance sequence just seem to fit into a film -- the way Strange Behavior smoothly incorporates old-style thrills with humor and wit, having a bunch of teens break out into dance to the song \"Lightning Strikes\" doesn't seem so unusual, especially since the theme of the party was 1960s TV characters! Disguising the location of New Zealand as an Illinois town was quite a treat as well. The story could have easily been done a number of times: small midwestern town, teens used as behavioral science subjects, mysterious murders by different killers...but of course the collaboration of Laughlin and Condon assures us this is not going to be typical. the focus is not to scare you out of your wits, but to offer something more mysterious. Add to that a very great choice for the cast (including more seasoned actors the likes of Michael Murphy, Fiona Lewis, Louise Fletcher, Charles Lane and others, plus the ever-smoking Dey Young and Dan Shor bring a likable aspect as well without being pushy teens) and an eye for design, Strange Behavior rises far above the cookie-cutter horror (particularly slasher) films of that time, and even in the present. There are many master shots that go for lengthy takes, and those of us that care more for story and dialogue can savor what's going on. I wouldn't be surprised that younger audiences that are used to fast cuts and one-liners would find this film too slow (and then again youth that are smarter might embrace this as other films from over 20 years ago). The minimal bloodletting works just as well, and the needle-in-the-eye trick can still illicit a good squirm today just as it did in 1981. It's great to see that Strange Behavior has influenced other films: Fiona Lewis' hairdo inspired the one Sean Young had in Blade Runner, and it's obvious the lackluster film Disturbing Behavior from 1998 was, to put it kindly, \"inspired\" by Strange Behavior. Joe Dante even wanted Fiona Lewis for Innerspace based on her being seen in this film. Strange Behavior is a great reminder of how things were so much more based on literal creativity and storytelling. Nowadays, it's all about special effects done digitally and pushing soundtracks from bands or music styles no one's going to care about 10 years from now. Laughlin and Condon were smart enough to give us elements that remain to this day unique, memorable, and never wearing out their welcome. Sure, by today's standards the film may not seem so shocking, but having come from being a \"teen\" back in 1980, it was refreshing for its time and has well earned its cult status. Sure, even the songs in it are more cool than what's considered a hit these days! Thank goodness Elite Entertainment has released the DVD in the film's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1, which also gives that widescreen feel of the 1950s thrillers in which Strange Behavior resembles so well. It makes my life much more fulfilling knowing such gems as this one are being given the respect and care in their restoration. Ignore the lower IMDb rating that it has at this time (just over a 4), because I feel it's being given a low rating by those who are too familiar with recent \"shockers.\" The general reviews by the press were quite good for Strange Behavior back when it was released, and I for one feel that I do know a bit more about what quality is since I've experienced these kinds of films and their evolution up through to today's more slicker productions. It's also why you're hearing more references to older TV shows and songs in today's advertisements: they just don't make 'em like they used to, and there's just more distinction and personality in things from way back when! Or at least, some of them, since this film definitely was different from anything else when IT was released. Long live Strange Behavior! Hypnotic.; Not quite the underrated masterpiece other people are talking about, I'm afraid. It begins well enough, with an atmospheric, out-of-this-world Tangerine Dream score and hypnotically slow direction, but the story tips its hand too early; the basics (if not the particulars) of its plot become rather obvious to us well before they do to the characters. Still, this is above average for an early-80s horror film.    (**) Hidden Ozploitation Gem?; A scientist is experimenting with teenagers and turning them into murderers. Although this movie is supposed to be taking place in suburban Illinois (the home state of director Michael Laughlin), it is actually the first horror film shot in New Zealand. Not until many years later, with Peter Jackson, would such horror films (notably \"Bad Taste\") really showcase the New Zealand scenery. The cast is impressive, with the Oscar-winning Louise Fletcher (\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\") in a small role and a young Dan Shor (perhaps best known as Billy the Kid from \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\"). Shor makes a great leading man, and it is a shame he never seems to have risen above supporting actor. The song \"Lightnin' Strikes\" was included because the writer (Bill Condon) was a big fan, but it also happens to be very appropriate for a horror film with its imagery of a stormy night. Heck, it also makes for a great group dance (surprisingly). Condon, incidentally, became a director in the late 1980s, and went on to direct some huge successes, including two films in the \"Twilight\" series. Severin has released the film on Blu-ray under the alternate (and inferior) title \"Dead Kids\". The disc is packed full of special features, including multiple commentary tracks. Even those who have enjoyed this film many times will be able to find something new here. The dead don't come back and take revenge - they don't.; This video nasty, released as \"Human Experiments\" with 26 seconds cut in 1994, and also known as \"Dead Kids\" in the US was one of the 74 films banned in Britain. Now, some may be grossed out quickly by Michael Murphy clipping his toenails at the breakfast table, Yech! I assure you there are more hideous things awaiting. It has lots of exciting scenes like the knife in the head, blood and screams, more blood and more screams. What it didn't have, however, was anything that would make this something to ban. Those 26 seconds must have been horrendous. I did enjoy seeing Louise Fletcher in a good role. Lousy!!!; \"Dead Kids\" aka \"Strange Behavior\" is really lame movie without scares or invention.The cast is horrid and very unappealing,the special effects are truly awful and the film is incredibly boring.Why do a lot of people like this piece of scum is beyond me.Sure,the concept is original and creative,but it should be better revealed.In conclusion,don't bother with this one. How will you spend your 200 dollars?; Slasher fans will have fun with this offbeat thriller filmed in New Zealand. It boasts a score by Tangerine Dream which is only occasionally effective. Several of the actors either went on to have a considerable body of film work afterwards or they arrived on set with it already under their belts. This has something going for it that so many slashers of the time did not: an adequate director. Michael Laughlin isn't an amazing director, but he does know how to make the camera his and our friend. He doesn't just turn the camera on and have people walk around in front of the lens and die as so many other abominable pictures of the time tended to do. He used some unusual angles and had items and hands coming from off camera at odd times. There's plenty of creepy shots to go around. An Illinois(ahem) college has a psychology department where students are paid to go through several sessions of new experimentation with behaviors. And some strange behavior results, of course. A woman in a lab coat with \"librarian hair\" who went to the Rachel Ward/Kelly LeBrock school of acting sets up the experiments, following in the footsteps(ha) of a doctor who used to work for the college. Enter young Brady, who wouldn't mind making some extra scratch, and he signs up for the program. Along the way, we discover that the research performed is making the guinea pig students into killers who stalk and stab. Rather unusual slasher fare, but it's quite good. Some highlights include the hilarious old cruster Donovon, who \"will find the fat ones\" and some of the worst dancers you've ever seen but somehow it's still fun to watch them. Possibly because this has one of the most tubular like awesome homemade Batman(and Robin) costumes you're likely to find around. Oh yeah, they're dancing, too! You may be disappointed to learn that the female doctor neither gets naked or gets the blade for a butchering she richly deserves. The last scene seems to cut to the credits rather abruptly. I was trying to recall where I'd seen Brady before and afterwards saw that he'd been in Tron. He has a young Steve Guttenberg appeal. Recommended for the great camera work, bloody stabbings, and fairly good acting almost all the way around(something of a rarity for these sorts of films). One of the better Aussie offerings. Of note, an alternate title is \"Dead Kids.\" Now, really, isn't that just the best horror title around? Almost as appropriate as Strange Behavior for a title. Unsettling and disturbing horror film; Strange Behavior really is a strange film. It is haunting, disturbing and so easy to be drawn into even with it's faults. The acting is excellent by everyone. Even the young lead Dan Shor was talented enough to show a wide range of facial expressions that conveyed what he was feeling by the smallest expressions. Some of the gore is played out very slowly and is so very hard to watch. One scene is a man's worst nightmare in a way you may not think. But beyond the gore are the bizarre and odd scenes that sometimes come to an abrupt halt. My thinking is the editor didn't have as much to work with as he had hoped. Some scenes end hastily which adds to the mystery of what is going on. In contrast, many of the sets are bright white with a pearlescent or shiny surface, some pastel mixed in here and there in paint or neon. One thinks of the surface of candy or TV commercial cleanliness. Other scenes show the beauty of the unspoiled countryside, the lives of people here are simple and uncomplicated. And along comes horror, the result of some gruesome killings. It's hard to believe that this film has stayed under the radar so long. Horror fans will love this and hopefully more people will discover it. But, it isn't for everyone. Before Bill Cordon became an ultra-liberal quack; Someone or someones are turning kids into murderers It's up to a local homicide cop to figure out what's happening..Of course this being a Bill Cordon written film he has to throw some gayness in there. Here it's in the form of naked male ass. Bill of course would go onto writing and directing movies that Liberals love and if you criticize them you're labeled a \"homophobe\", \"Puritan\", \"Close-minded\", or any combination there of. Such crap as \"Gods and Monsters\" and the abysmal glorification of pedophilia and his return to the mad \"scientist\" motif that is \"Kinsey\" If Mr. Cordon only stuck to semi-enjoyable low-grade horror films like this and \"Strange Invaders\", I wouldn't have a bone to pick with him (no pun intended) My Grade:C+ DVD Extras: Commentary with Bill Condon, Dan Shor, and Dey Young; Isolated music score; 2 deleted scenes with optional commentary; Photo gallery; Filmographies; Theatrical Trailer; and Trailers for \"Dead Kids\" (This films original title), \"Patrick\", \"Thirst\", and \"Syngenor\" A few Inspired moments of Horror, but Dull & Unbalanced; In a small town in Illinois, the local teenagers have found a new way to make after school cash. They have been volunteering as test subjects at the local University in the psychology department run by Dr. Gwen Parkinson (Lewis). Parkinson is secretly doing the work of Dr. Le Sange (Dignam) who is believed to be dead after the crazed doctor was caught doing mind experiments on the kids which resulted in the death of the wife of local sheriff John Brady (Murphy). John's son Pete (Shor) has now began to volunteer and starts showing psychotic tendencies. Also known as \"Strange Behavior\", this film was shot in New Zealand and passed off as Illinois. Essentially it's the mad scientist behind the evil in this unbalanced horror film. There are a few effective sequences like when a mind controlled girl chases an old woman through a house and when twisted Oliver (Marc McClure) puts on a Tor Johnson mask and stalks and slashes a girl at a party. Unfortunately there are plenty of dull moments spread throughout and both the action and actors seem bored. This movie flicks to life in a few flashes which makes it watchable but it just never catches any momentum and in the end is quite forgettable. Different horror film, but falls apart in the middle; The first half of this horror film, about strange experiments going on at a small campus, is very good. It was very effective thanks to a chilling score by Tangerine Dream and had some expert cinematography. It also had some big names in the cast. Michael Murphy (M*A*S*H), Louise Fletcher(One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest) and classic film actor Charles Lane. But then, maybe 3/4ths of the way through, it gets terrible. And it gets there quick. I think the scene that convinced me this movie was no longer good was the one where Michael Murphy's character is talking to Louise Fletcher's at the kitchen table. He talks about this evil scientist like he's some cartoon super villain. In fact, the plot to this whole movie becomes a ridiculous mad scientist/ revenge story like you would see in a Poverty Row production from the 30s or 40s, with hilariously campy lab scenes straight out of a bottom of the barrel James Bond flick. It loses all credibility here. It loses it's atmospheric feel , the blond kid acts like he's high for most of the rest of the film, and it has a climax that is very predictable and feels like it was thought up right on the spot. It also has one of the most pointless and confusing (to me anyway) \"last lines\" in movie history, and ends abruptly. I would also like to note that, unless I missed something, we never find out what happens to any of the kids that the mad doctor experiments on. (SPOILER) They just kill and disappear from the film altogether. So to me, it just seems like the filmmakers stopped caring halfway through. They don't even try to cover up this one kid's New Zealand accent (it's set in Illinois, but was shot in New Zealand.) This movie is included in the same set with \"Patrick\". It is marginally better than that film but alas, only marginally. Fresh Blood; In a small New Zealand (as Illinois) town, future acclaimed filmmaker Bill Condon (as Bryan Morgan) is stabbed in silhouette after his parents leave him home alone. Elsewhere, aging teenager Dan Shor (as Pete Brady) is having trouble persuading \"top cop\" father Michael Murphy (as John) to sponsor an application to Galesburg College. To raise money, Mr. Shor accompanies pal Marc McClure (as Oliver Myerhoff) to the college's psychology department, where the lads are paid $200 to volunteer for some supposedly harmless experiment. Administered by creepily sexy Fiona Lewis (as Gwen Parkinson), you can bet the experiment has something to do with the film's rising body count... \"Strange Behavior\" features some of the usual genre missteps, but they're interjected with freshness. The characters are introduced uniquely. Shor shows his cheeks, and Mr. Murphy clips his toenails at the breakfast table. Louise Fletcher (as Barbara Moorehead) is okay, but in a much smaller role than heralded. Best of all is a sixties TV costume party kicked off by Lou Christie's hit single \"Lightnin' Strikes\" (1966) and ending in what can be described as \"Uncle Fester\" stabbing \"Hoss Cartwright\" to death. The Tangerine Dream soundtrack is sweet. Director Michael Laughlin, working with Mr. Condon, nicely mixes fright with fun, and they neatly construct an unexpected plot twist. ****** Strange Behavior (10/16/81) Michael Laughlin ~ Dan Shor, Michael Murphy, Fiona Lewis, Louise Fletcher Quirky, oddly gripping low budget horror; Inventive horror yarn that transcends the usual slasher fare by mixing in an imaginative, sometimes scarily plausible plot with the usual nasty in-your-face violence that goes with the period. Filmed in New Zealand but set in America, the photography in this film is ruined by a hideous print and poor pan-and-scan job on the video version I saw, but that doesn't stop it being a tense and grisly exercise in terror that proves to be a lot stronger than other '80s horror fare. I know I always use it as a whipping boy, but the Friday the 13 series in comparison is sterile, comic book stuff. I really liked this film's plot of a science lab being the front of a brainwashing cult, which I believe hadn't been done elsewhere. Some scenes are packed with tension and the film as a whole is very suspenseful. The gore isn't overdone, but is still pretty strong stuff and used in a way to make you squirm (for example, in one scene a boy slashes open his own wrists - ouch!). The scene in which the maid discovers a girl sawing the arm off a corpse is particularly grisly. At the same time, there's a great final twist in the plot (the \"kill your father\" scene) which I have to say I didn't see coming, although some other moments are predictable. The acting as a whole is impressive, especially when you consider most of the cast are unknowns. Particularly affecting are Dan Shor as the brainwashed teen, Fiona Lewis as a despicably evil nurse and, most of all, Arthur Dignam (for trivia fans, he went on to play Ernest Thesiger in GODS AND MONSTERS) as the weird-looking, immortal scientist. Great stuff. While the film does have some lulls and seems overlong at even a fairly shot running time, it still manages to be quirky, unpredictable and on the occasion, intensely gripping. Strangeness and disquiet.; \"Strange Behavior\" is a bizarre slasher/mad scientist horror film with moody score by Tangerine Dream.John Brady,sheriff of the small town of Galseburg,investigates a series of incidents where teenagers have gone berserk and started killing people.At the same time Brady's son Pete tries seeks to earn money for university tuition by volunteering for a series of mind control experiments being run by Dr Gwen Parkinson at the university psychology department.\"Strange Behavior\" is the first horror film that was actually shot in New Zealand.The direction by Michael Laughlin is flat and there are some dull and lifeless moments.Still there are also some nasty shocks including particularly brutal throat stabbing committed by the masked killer at party.If you liked \"Strange Behavior\" check out \"Death Warmed Up\" with its almost identical plot.7 out of 10 The Best Scene in a Movie Ever?; Overall, Strange Behaviour is a fairly lame sci-fi/horror hybrid with seemingly ordinary kids making a few bucks at a research facility and turning out a little bit...wrong. There are a few decent shocks here and there, but mostly it seems like there's just something missing - like the filmmakers lost part of the script on the way to the shoot and just went with it. Cinematic ally, there's no real reason to watch it, but there's also no real reason not to. However, our hero goes to a party (for no reason) and it's a costume party (for no reason) and eventually everyone breaks out into a synchronized dance to Lou Christie's \"Lightning Strikes.\" That's quite possibly the greatest scene in a movie ever. Take some tests,to get some cash.; In the last few weeks I've been passed one or two (what looked like) low-budget horror DVDs.Im surprised to find out that this is the first film by writer Bill Condon.While it has some slight \"slasher\" parts that defined the 1980s horrors,thankfully this films doges most of these things (no sign of groups of \"dumb teens\"),and thought flawed,this is still a very good under-rated horror: The Plot: Pete Brody finds out that hes been offered a place at some top colleges (includeing the same one his dad,the head of police,John went to.)But he unable to afford the cost of going to them,Pete gets some advice from a friend,so he decides to go to an \"animal testing\" lab,and offers himself as a human guinipig.What Pete does not know is that his dad blames the death of his mother on the lab,and with killings starting to happened by teens who are on a \"weight loss\" pill made at the lab.So John decides to look deeper into the workings of the lab... View on the film: The score is by famous electronic band Tangerine Dream,who give a very good ambient score,and there's also song by before-he-went-solo Nick Caves band The Birthday Party.The screenplay by Bill condon,one of the things thew film looks at is animal testing,thought sadly Condon does not fully build on the very interesting issues,thought he thankfully does include some good horror scenes (the best one being in a mens toilet!)The odd thing is for some scenes it seems that someone has pressed \"mute\" on the sound-effects! Final view on the film: A good horror film,with a good cast,score and screenplay,thats sadly let down by the low budget. Authentic take-on the slasher formula; *Spoilers Small Town Massacre really pushes the limits for being classed as a traditional slasher movie. Most of the post-Halloween additions basically stuck with the lone-maniac stalks teenagers scenario; but Michael Laughlin's impressive opus includes multiple killers and a completely authentic conclusion to an engaging mystery. Despite those blatant discrepancies however, it still wouldn't seem right to class this amongst any other horror sub-category, as it does include many of the genre's prominent trappings. One of the assassins sports a white mask and you'll also find a shockingly large amount of cheese, which is no less than hilarious in places. The thing that really lifted this above many of its counterparts from the peak year of 1981, were the surprisingly strong performances from a refreshingly competent cast. Academy Award-winner Louise Fletcher and Michael Murphy lead respectively, while Dan Shor and Dey Young provide credible youthful support. It also boasts a great periodic soundtrack, which includes tracks from Tangerine Dream and Lou Christie (more on that later). Unfortunately, on the down side, the frame cropping for videotape transfer from the cinematic release is no less than abysmal in places. There are times throughout the movie when the actor's faces are completely cut from the screen, and one could be forgiven for initially believing that a cack-handed camera operator was at fault for the incompetent photography. The reality of the matter is that the leap from the silver screen to VCR certainly wasn't kind to Laughlin's spacious set-locations. I remember many years ago, when I was only knee-high to a hubcap, noticing this suggestive cover signalling for my inspection like a beacon in the foggy night sky at my local video store. After checking the plot synopsis and wondering what words such as 'mutilated' could possibly mean, I decided that one-day I would have to pluck up the courage to actually purchase it and find out for myself. Of course, those movies rarely - if ever - terrified me as much as I had expected them to, but I kept that same copy right up until this day, and was indeed intrigued to see if my glowing memories had served me as well as I'd hoped for. It opens with a youngster studying in his bedroom; his parents inform him that they're leaving, so he sparks-up a sly cigarette and turns on the radio (cue some cheesy eighties grooves, via the Pop Mechanics!). He's puffing away merrily, when all of a sudden; we're thrown into darkness, courtesy of a convenient power-cut. To solve the problem, the teen heads downstairs, picking up a handy candle en-route and sparking it up with a lighter. With the small amount of light that emerges from the flickering flame, he begins making hand shapes in the shadows; only soon we learn that he isn't going to be enjoying these creations on his own for much longer. Another silhouette appears, clenching a knife, and let me just state that those will be the last finger puppets that he'll be making for the foreseeable future. Next we learn that this isn't going to be a typical trip into whodunit's-ville, because we see the killer's face as he blows out the candle. Soon after we meet our central family of characters that will guide us through the story, - the Bradys (no not the Brady bunch, unfortunately!) John (Michael Murphy) is the local Sheriff, who's got some serious personal hygiene problems (well, would you cut your toenails at the kitchen table?). His son, Pete (Dan Shor) is an intelligent young student that's debating his educational future and deciding which college that he wants to attend in the fall. His dad wants him to leave the area and pursue his career options elsewhere, but Pete has decided to stay rooted in his hometown of Galesburg. His only problem is that he doesn't have enough money to submit his application, but thankfully his scrawny buddy Oliver, knows 'a fast and easy way to make money'. The local Hospital is paying 200 dollars a time, for student's participation in un-clarified medical experiments, which Ollie describes as two simple sessions. These scientists prove that they are well ahead of their game with a demonstration in which a dead professor manages to control the mind of a chicken to make it obey his every command. Ingenious stuff, I'm sure you'll agree. An extremely sadistic-looking nurse called Miss Parkinson controls the moneymaking experiments, and Pete makes an appointment to visit her the following day. The night before his date with the medic, Pete informs his mother in-law, Barbara (Louise Fletcher) that he's got a party to attend; a fancy dress gathering no less, - and oh what a memorable celebration it turns out to be. One beaming female describes it as 'an honour of independence', which I guess is one way of putting it. A more descriptive term though, would be a no holds barred romp of amazingly sidesplitting comedy that will have even the most sinister viewers holding their guts with paroxysms of laughter. The highlight is when the teens begin to boogie and we get a wonderfully daft sequence in which all the comically dressed revellers do a synchronised dance routine that looks like it has been borrowed from Grease, more than a slasher film. They start by doing the 'locomotive', before they take it in turns to jump in front of the camera and do the 'hokey-cokey' in quick succession (!) The song that invites this unforgettable sequence is no less than Lou Christie's classic sixties dancehall favourite, Lightening Strikes. Falsetto king, Christie was notable because he was one of the very few vocalists to emerge between the death of Buddy Holly and the Beatles' worldwide explosion as a teen idol, and sustain a strong career for a long time after. The musical months from1960 to 1963 are often referred to, as the 'lost years' because very few artists appeared around the time that were not crushed by the big-beat phenomenon that was launched by British bands such as The Rolling Stones and John Lennon and crew. There's nothing that I can remember ever witnessing that compares to watching Batman and Robin taking it in turns to boogie, and its moments like those, which make this film so decidedly enjoyable. Anyway, the fun doesn't last for too long, and soon we get back to more of what people were truly expecting, - the horror side of things. Cut to two youngsters that probably couldn't handle watching any more grooving, because their sides had almost split, so they've headed out to the peaceful serenity of a parked car, in an attempt to escape the hilarity. We sail into traditional territory when Lucy rebuffs Waldo's romantic advances, because she claims that she has to get home very soon and they should be leaving right about now. Once the budding lothario has learnt that he isn't going to get anywhere that particular night, they decide to split; only that might not be such an easy task, as the car seems to be firmly rooted in the mud. Waldo jumps out to push, telling the strumpet to gun it, only his problems don't end there. In fact, things get a whole lot worse or the unfortunate fella when he bumps into a masked maniac that stabs him in the throat with a large blade. Then we get a suspenseful chase through the woodland, as the psycho pursues the terrified female back to the party, making the effort to stab her in the ankle as he goes. His murderous intent is ruined when the partygoers hear her frantic screams, so the assassin decides to heel it from the scene very abruptly. Before he disappears into the pitch-black night, he removes his mask to reveal a face that we already know fairly well. And so the plot thickens... The following morning, John interviews many of the teenagers - including the killer -, but none of them has any recollection of the events that unfolded. He realises that he has a maniac roaming around the town, when Barbara discovers the mutilated body of the teen that was murdered in the opening scene, craftily disguised as a scarecrow (perhaps as a nod to Dark Night of the Scarecrow?). Meanwhile, Pete keeps his appointment with the enigmatic nurse, which amounts to not a lot more than him taking a strange pill that he says, 'makes him feel a little high'! Earning 100 dollars for getting stoned; that must be every student's dream! To add to his good-fortune, he pulls a stunning blonde receptionist (Dey Young) and the two go out for dinner, which results in the beginning of a microwave relationship. That night, another of the town's teenagers and a cranky cleaner are murdered in a fairly taught sequence that mimics Halloween's use of building fear from staging creepy occurrences in the background of the screen's focal point (a door opening slowly behind the unsuspecting soon-to-be victim etc.) Due to previous experience, John decides that he knows what is behind this sudden spate of murderous mania, and heads off to investigate, which results in a fairly shocking showdown and an unexpected twist in the story. Small Town Massacre has enough confidence in the strength of its truly shocking and fairly intelligent conclusion, not to ruin the rest of the movie with pointless false-scares and gratuitous gore. Although, saying that, there is at least one un-watchable scene, where Pete gets a four-inch syringe pushed into his eyeball, while strapped to a chair! It would be truly terrifying to viewers who have a strong phobia of medicinal needles, which is quite a common fear amongst non-diabetics. As I said before, this isn't really a traditional slasher movie, but it succeeds because it tries a refreshing alternate setting to a genre that was all ready beginning to grow tired, even that early on. Aside from the licensed tunes that may bring back fond memories for fans of nostalgia, we're also offered a neat acoustic guitar-based score that provides the film's accompaniment; and a more typical synthesizer lick for the moments of horror. Although this is supposed to be set in Illinois, Chicago (Halloween?), it was actually filmed in New Zealand, explaining some of the beautiful shots of scenery that break up the story. The cast offer a few genuinely credible performances and the characters that they portray are fairly approachable and above all likeable, so that you feel for their individual torments. Laughlin also manages to build suspense in places, especially towards the finale with the will-he won't-he cliffhanger. Sadly, the chopped screen does cause a few viewing problems, and it's clumsily edited to the point of aggravation in places. There are a few plot-holes that I can't really tell you about without including a spoiler; but overall, it's competently written and makes the most of the authentic ideas that it has on offer. The BBFC don't admit to cutting anything from the murders, although there were a couple of suspicious jumps, which were impossible to tell whether they were the fault of lazy editing or outside censorship intervention? All in all, I actually thoroughly enjoyed watching Small Town Massacre and certainly suggest that you hunt it out if you're a fan of slashers or tacky eighties horror. It's been OOP for quite a long while now, but you may be able to track down a copy under one of its four aliases, if you run a search with a video-finding agency. The fancy dress scene alone makes it worth a budget asking price, and it also boasts a few edge of your seat thrills that separate it from the influx of its more formulaic counterparts from '81. It certainly deserves a visit from people looking for a different take-on the genre One of the truly great, overlooked, horror movies of the last 22 years.; Chock full of haunting images, chilling murders, and good performances this slow, laconic but amazingly effective horror flick has stayed with me since I saw it when it was originally released.  The film is best in its portrayal of teen life in a small college town in the midwest (though it was shot in New Zealand).  Taking it's cue from there, the film moves along at a leisurely, but ultimately disquieting pace revealing that all is not so sleepy and calm in this rural environment. Co-written by Academy Award-winner Bill Condon (\"GODS AND MONSTERS\") the story shows remarkable intelligence and wit in the vein of some of the best Roman Polanski flicks (e.g. \"THE TENANT\" and \"REPULSION\"). Best if seen in the movie theater to appreciate it's glorious widescreen landscapes.  Wish this picture was out on DVD. Trippy eighties slasher; Strange Behaviour takes influence from the idea of drugs/mind control that other films have used previously and since; and wraps this around a story that sees college kids murdering people. This is actually a decent springboard for a horror flick, and while Strange Behaviour is not a complete dead loss; it's not as good as it could have been, and when it all comes down to it; what we really have here is little more than another eighties slasher. As mentioned, the plot focuses on drugs and mind control and begins with several people being murdered for unknown reasons and by unknown assailants. Police Chief Jim Brady begins looking into the crimes at around the same time that his son agrees to participate in some behaviour orientated tests (unbeknown to his father). The police officer remains clueless about the identity of the murderers and the motives for the killing, but it soon becomes apparent that the tests his son is participating in may have something to do with the shocking and random murder spree befalling the town. The film has a handful of good ideas and the trippy atmosphere (bolstered by a soundtrack courtesy of Tangerine Dream) is good too. However, it's also very derivative and descents into familiar territory all too quickly, which is a shame as more could have been made from the premise. Strange Behaviour is an eighties horror film, so I'm sure nobody will go in expecting anything resembling good acting; and it's a good job too because this film doesn't have any. The exception to this, however, is the performance from Louise Fletcher (previously in films such as The Fury and Tintorerra), which is actually quite good. There's some decent violence to enjoy at least and an eyeball syringing scene stands out in terms of the cringe factor. It all boils down to a decent if not particularly surprising ending, although it does at least wrap everything up. I wouldn't by any means call Strange Behaviour a great film, but it does at least provide an hour and a half of decent entertainment and there are many worse examples of eighties horror films.   \n",
       "10807  Jack Ryan Is Back!; Harrison Ford is back as Jack Ryan, the star of the famous Tom Clancy novels, in this \"new\" adventure, Clear and Present Danger. When compared to Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games, this is probably the worst film. But, it still is a pretty good, tense film with some crafty action scenes. Philip Noyce's film is about how Jack Ryan moves up in the world since his boss is very ill. His first mission as CIA acting deputy director, is too stop the trafficking of drugs in Colombia quick and quietly. But there already may be a team there..... Harrison Ford is good as always in his role as Jack Ryan. I noticed that unlike Patriot Games, he seems reluctant to carry a gun. James Earl Jones is also really good and his performance made me connect with my emotions. Overall, this is a solid thriller which displayed some good action scenes. The story is nothing new as many movies these days focus on drug cartels. But if done right, it can still be good. I rate this film 8/10. Perfectly Clear and Present for 1994; Though I remember liking this when it opened in August of 1994 and more than Patriot Games but far under The Hunt for Red October and one climactic line (\"How DARE YOU, SIR!\"), I could not for the life of me recall anything else. That's probably not a good sign for a movie I thought I liked. The first half of this movie plays like a TV movie with a plot a seven year old could follow and the film really doesn't pick up until act 2. Luckily, by then we're invested and totally rooting for John/Jack Ryan. 21 years later and only my 2nd viewing in as many years, I believe it somewhat holds up. Not to mention and comparatively speaking, it blows the other Jack Ryan installments out of the water, with the exception of The Hunt for Red October. Patriot Games, The Sum of all Fears and Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit all wither to this film. Oh, and please, guys, five Ryan films, two good and the last one 21 years ago. No more trying. Just move on. An atrocity to a fine novel; Clancy should sue!; The book was great.  I realize that rarely does a movie cover a book well, but this was absolutely ridiculous!  Half the scenes in the movie were completely fabricated from the screenwriter's imagination, and bore no resemblance to the events portrayed in the book.  Furthermore, the casting was awful.  Willem DaFoe as Clark?  Give me a break!  DaFoe is a great actor, but horribly miscast here.  All in all, it was disgraceful.  Even as a stand-alone movie, it stunk. William Dafoe steals the film...Ford is not at his best...; Harrison Ford is rumored to have disliked playing Jack Ryan in 'Clear and Present Danger' (for whatever reasons, I don't know), so perhaps that's the reason William Dafoe (who obviously relishes his part as a deadly field operative) is able to steal the film. At any rate, it's a well-done action thriller, the kind that Tom Clancy does so well. And, yes, it matches the excitement of 'Patriot Games'. A standout is the ambush scene involving an FBI motorcade unexpectedly under crossfire in the crowded streets of Colombia. Not as convoluted a plotline as usual in these sort of stories, it still has some confusing bits of business involving the drug lords and shady Washington officials. Harrison Ford's fans may prefer him in his Indiana Jones guise, and here they have even more reason because his performance is sub-par. Although a bit too long with some slow moments in between the action, it's definitely worth your time. Indiana Jones: The CIA years; The 1990's saw the addition of orbital satellites, laser guided bombs, fibre optic cameras, night vision goggles, personal computers, state of the art hardware, and more overtly militaristic themes to the techno-thriller format. One of the best of these films, which tended to coincide with the first Gulf War and the fall of the Soviet Union, was \"Patriot Games\", directed by Phillip Noyce with a certain classiness. The plot is a generic revenge tale, but it takes place within a world that is genuinely interesting: CIA conferences, Pentagon back-rooms, high-tech gear, telephone calls from the president etc. Building on the work of political thriller directors like Costa Gavras, Pakula, Frankenheimer, John Schlesinger and Fred Zinnemann, and mainstream novelists like Michael Crichton and Frederick Forsyth in the 70s and Tom Clancy in the 80s, an entire vocabulary was being added to here. Beyond the classy direction and the cool gear on display (the film has 3 good action sequences  one involving a CIA raid viewed entirely through a spy satellite- a big deal back in 1992), \"Patriot Games\" is mildly interesting for a couple other reasons. This is another in a long line of movies in which Harrison Ford finds himself playing a meek everyman who bravely protect his family, and it's funny to see the film's scriptwriters struggling to be politically correct. They want IRA bad guys, but they don't actually want to offend the IRA, so they opt instead for an Irish bad guy who is \"too hardcore for even the IRA\". End result: writers able to serve up easy cartoon villains whilst also placating their conscience. More interesting is the way all these films popped up during the First Gulf War. Like an unconscious display of American prowess, in the form of super advanced technology and \"all seeing\" surveillance gear, \"Patriot Games\" might as well have been an advertisement for the military industrial complex and the long reaching arm of Uncle Sam. In terms of flaws, the film has two: at times the villains are pure cartoon and the film's ending features a silly action scene on a boat, hastily tacked on by nervous studio heads. A better director would have extended the action sequence in the house (the film's climax features a battle in a CIA safe house) and omitted the boat sequence entirely. Released 2 years before \"Patriot Games\", \"The Hunt For Red October\" trades Gulf War muscle flexing for post Cold War, pro Soviet/American bridge building. But though it pretends to be about the healed wounds between Russia and America, this is still a rather propagandistic flick, about a Russian submarine captain who seeks to defect to the glorious promise land of Uncle Sam. Here, like \"Patriot Games\", a techno-culturally superior America is filled with good leaders and upstanding generals, and Russians would be crazy not to come on over for a slice of \"freedom\". Still, the film was directed by John McTiernan (\"Die Hard\", \"Predator\", \"Die Hard 3\", \"Thomas Crown Affair\"  all good action flicks), so it has a certain style to it. Like \"Patriot Games\", once you get past some clichés and some clownishness, it's a rather serious picture with some nice hardware on display for the boys and some well mounted action scenes. Released in 1994, and again directed by Phillip Noyce, \"Clear and Present Danger\" is the most sophisticated of these films, which were all based on Tom Clancy novels (Clancy, a major tech-head, fantasises about World War 3 for a living). Here, the world isn't made up of good guys and bad guys and there are lots of conflicting, self interests. The villain here is also nothing less than the President of the United States, a gutsy move, though by now this \"paternal villain\" cliché is getting old (\"The Fugitive\", \"LA Confidential\", \"Monster's Inc\", \"Minority Report\" etc). Unusual for such films, \"Danger\" points out the immorality of affairs such as Irangate, doesn't salivate over the film's depiction of a secret war in South America (which Noyce links to Vietnam), considers (somewhat) the moral implications of violence, criticises snap emotive responses and deals with political betrayals and private agendas among both the President and his advisers. Where the film differs significantly from its 1970s predecessors, is it's total lack of impotency: the 90s spy-hero doesn't shy away from responsibility, and will go so far as to topple the Presidency to maintain the good of his country What's funny, though, is that the film treats its central idea (the President mounting an illegal covert war in Panama) as a shockingly evil thing. In the real world, despite the fact that the American President is not allowed to deploy or instigate any military actions without Congress first declaring war, he routinely does so. Iraq, Vietnam, Korea etc, not to mention countless CIA instigated coups in places like Haiti, Iran, Chile and Ecuador, were all illegal by the Constitution of the United States. The fact is, Congress is always sidestepped, most recently in the \"bank bailout package\" fiasco. This being Tom Clancy, the main attraction is once again the gear on display: laser guided bombs, F18 hornets, sniper's hidden in the grass, an RPG attack on a convoy etc. From here, many computer game franchises would spawn, and from there, a banalization of military technology. People used to go to these thrillers and marvel at the hardware, gasping at the inside looks offered of the Oval Office and Pentagon, but now such things are routine, countless TV shows (West Wing, 24, The Unit, JAG) and video games (why be wowed by the sniper on screen, when you can BE him online) diluting the spectacle that made these films popular in the 90s. 8/10 - With the down sizing of armies around the world, and all technology fetishized to the point of disaffection, the techno-thriller genre (itself a genre borne from war, see Lang's 1928 \"Spies\") looks like it's winding down again. Ford Brings Freshness In His Second Portrayal Of Jack Ryan.; Clear And Present Danger is a spy action thriller that is based on the novel of Tom Clancy of the same title.It features Harrison Ford in the title role as Jack Ryan with James Earl Jones,who portrays as Vice-Admiral James Greer together with supporting cast that includes Willem Dafoe,Miguel Sandoval,Belita Moreno and Joaquim de Almeida.it was directed by Philip Noyce,who also was at helm in other Jack Ryan films such as The Hunt For Red October and Patriot Games. The film's setting happens when Jack Ryan has been appointed as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) acting Deputy Director.He later discovers that he is being kept in the dark by some of his CIA colleagues in the agency about a covert war operation against the drug lords at Colombia.Later,it was also revealed that the President's wealthy friend is well-connected to the said Colombian drug cartel.When the national security adviser and the CIA deputy director were captured in Colombia,the President's men decided to abandon their force.In the end,it was up to Jack Ryan and another operative to rescue them on their won risking his career and life. This is the second time that Harrison Ford will portray Jack Ryan after Patriot Games and he brings earnestness and freshness to the role.Aside from that,it the story provides complex political intrigue,interesting plot and lots of tension that it is fun to sit through as it is exciting and entertaining from beginning to end.Despite some confusion that it may provide in the political ideologies and beliefs that the characters in it adhere to including the President,what stands out here though is the moral dilemma that Jack Ryan as it brings his humanistic side of saving lives in danger which could probably considered the overall theme of this action thriller. The better of Harrison's Jack Ryan films; While less believable than the book by having Jack involved in almost every plot point - in Tom Clancy's novel he only properly comes into the main story in the last third - it's a more satisfying experience all round than Patriot Games. Some patience is required as much of the first half is spent introducing new characters, setting up plot, etc. The investigation of a hit on a businessman and his family on a luxury yacht by a pair of hired muscle reveals connections with a Colombian drug cartel - the businessman was skimming money from them, and he and his family paid for it with their lives. The money skimmed is located, and the US government seizes it which angers the drug baron who was being scammed, Ernesto Escobedo. Escobedo's intel man, former Cuban DGI colonel Felix Cortez, sees an opportunity to seize power by having the US Ambassador, and the visiting FBI Director assassinated. Meanwhile, the CIA, without Ryan's knowledge, is running an illegal covert operation against the drug cartels, with covert troops deep in Colombia staging hit and run raids on drug factories, and secret airports used for aircraft smuggling drugs. The assassinations provoke the President into ordering things to be taken to a new lever. An aerial strike is ordered against a drug baron's mansion while he is meeting with several others, and attempts are made to pass it off as a car bombing by angry cartel members. But not only is Jack growing suspicious that his own country is doing something illegal, Cortez also is becoming alert to the fact the US government is running a secret operation in a supposedly friendly nation. When Cortez blackmails a senior US official into giving him the locations of the US troops in Colombia, Jack, with the help of a shadowy field agent called John Clark - Willem Dafoe - takes matters into his own hands. Convoluted to be sure, but a thoroughly intriguing political thriller, with great action sequences, particularly the RPG attack on the convoy in Bogota. The climactic rescue sequence is rather weak compared to the more epic version in the book, more akin to a 12-rated Rambo movie, but it works well in itself. The showdown with the President provides plenty of sparks - I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES - though the ending departs considerably from the book. Intelligent, yet Laborious at times; WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS \"Clear and Present Danger\" is the third translation of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series to the screen, and the second one starring Harrison Ford as the \"thinking-man's James Bond\".  Although a definite improvement over \"Patriot Games\", and on par with \"The Hunt for Red October\", the film contains serious points of lag.  The material in these drawn out sequences is interesting, but it molds the film into an average entry in either of two categories: either as a tepid action film, or an underdeveloped drama.  Holes aside, the film is engaging enough to wet the appetites of fans of either genre, and is an entertaining experience overall. Ford is the best Jack Ryan in my opinion, successfully conveying Ryan's intelligence as well as his vulnerability in dangerous situations.  Plus he is able to inject his trademark charm and snide humor into the role which gives the character a more down-to-earth character we can relate to.  Part of the problem with the movie is the lack of development of the rest of the characters.  Since the script is burdened with an array of important roles, their screen time is often marginalized.  For example, Willem Dafoe is given hardly any development prior to the climax of the film.  I respect Dafoe as an actor greatly, and found myself wishing that he would be involved in more of the film.  Anne Archer has the throwaway role as the wife of Jack Ryan, but James Earl Jones is able to shine as Admiral Greer, even though he's on the sidelines.  Some characters just don't fit, like the entire cabinet of political bigwigs who orchestrate the events of the movie.  Donald Moffat is ridiculous and an utter buffoon of a president, and Henry Czerny seems to be insidious for no reason.  Many of these holes in characters could have been remedied with another half hour of screen time. However, my last comment would have shifted the context of the movie to a full blown drama.  As much as Clancy's work is engaging, the movie cannot stand on its own without the promise of action.  The action scenes are well done and gripping at times, but they are merely peppered throughout the film.  Philip Noyce is able to create scenes of tension without using weapons, such as the well-done scene involving a computer battle between Ford and Czerny.  Overall, the film gives off an odor stemming from a lack of sustained tension, and the plot visibly loses steam at points. Ultimately, the main problem with \"Clear and Present Danger\" is the problem of defining what it \"clearly\" is as a movie.  But, if you're a fan of Clancy's work or are just looking for an entertaining movie, give this one a rent. One of the best of the 90's; Clear and present danger is a simply amazing combination of old school spy thriller and action movie rolled into one. The pace is simply intelligent and the film avoids clichés. We open with the Coast Guard tracking a boat that had strayed off course. After stopping, boarding, and arresting the \"pirates\" aboard the ship, they stumble upon a crime scene. The murder victim isn't just your average citizen, he is a friend of one of the most powerful men in the world, the president of the United States, played to a statesmen effect by Donald Moffett. Spurred by the need of revenge, the plot is planned by two white house staff members, James Cutter (played by legendary character actor Harris Yulin), and Robert Ritter (played by Henry Czerny, who plays the role with the perfect blend of ruthlessness and coldness) James Earl Jones reprises his role as Adm. Greer, and Harrison Ford the role of Jack Ryan, the straight edged hero who sees the world in right and wrong. Both are simply spectacular in the roles. The film also has a good amount of name actors in supporting roles, such as Benjamin Bratt, Ann Magnuson, Williem DeFoe, Thora Birch, Joaquim De Almeida (from Despardo fame), and the late Hope Lange. As the plot unfolds, Ryan is pulled into a world that he's not completely ready to handle. He seems completely shocked that such corruption can come from the White House. On the surface, you can somewhat identify with President Bennett's need for revenge. One his best friends, along with the man's wife, and young son and daughter, who brutally murdered and tossed overboard into the sea. However, the means to which he goes borderlines on the obsessive and dangerous. His actions may lead to the deaths of several drug dealers and their counterparts, but it also leads to the deaths of several women and young children. The underlining question becomes, does the person seeking revenge become just as evil as those they seek revenge on. As Ryan is pulled into this twisted world of revenge he finds himself pushed to his own boundaries. He's nearly killed in an assassination attempt. He's caught in the middle of a coupe between a drug lord and his underlings. And he soon learns that he is as much responsible for the deaths of US Troops as those who sent them on the mission. For once, his moral view of right and wrong has led to someone's death. I think the franchise dropped off without Harrison Ford in the role of Jack Ryan. He seemed to bring the most to the table. Simply put, he was more believable in the role then the other actors who've tackled the role. Of all the Jack Ryan films, I think Patriot Games and it's sequel, Clear and Present Danger remain the best in terms of storyline, character development, and overall direction. I think that some viewers will be left at the end, wondering what will happen to Ryan, as he's testifying at the end of the film about the activities that had taken place. FRom the open to the close, the movie pulls you in, and even at slightly over two hours, the film never overstays its welcome. 10 out of 10!!! Great book, rotten movie.; Every time I have seen Tom Clancy's novels adapted to screen, they have been atrocious.  Being a major fan of Clancy's novels, it seems as though whenever they are adapted to the big screen, the writers botch the whole process.  None of the novels that have been made into movies do the books any justice. A Lot More Good Than Bad; Harrison Ford returns as \"Jack Ryan,\" star of the very well-done \"Patriot Games,\" the film adaption off the best-selling Tom Clancy novels. Also returning are Anne Archer and James Earl Jones. THE BAD - This isn't as intense, especially in the first half hour, as Patriot Games and the ending was a little disappointing with a action-scene credibility problem. Once again - it's getting to be a tired Hollywood theme - top U.S. government officials, going all the way to the President, are corrupt people, liars not to be trusted. THE GOOD - It's nice to see Willem Dafoe finally play a good guy. The villains in here are deceptively interesting, actors such as Joaquim De Almeida, Harris Yulin and Henry Czerny and Miguel Sandoval - not big names but recognizable and good actors. The violence is not overdone in here and when the action does occur, the sound is terrific. The best action scene was shootout in the streets with snipers firing at cars below. The positives are far more than the negatives, making this a solid thriller. Jack Ryan returns against a new enemy, but an old plot...; Harrison Ford returns as Jack Ryan, a CIA operative who's boss becomes hospitalized at a time when the President of the United States has declared war on the Columbian drug cartels (again?) I saw this movie for the first time the other day.  I have seen \"The Hunt For Red October\" and \"The Sum of All Fears\" before, so I was familiar with Jack Ryan, but Ryan has moved up the ladder a little bit in this film and he finds himself in a twist to the plot: people are behind some of the illegal tactics while fighting the war against drugs that lead him to a place where he, for obvious reasons, reluctantly treads. This is a very good movie!  Willem Dafoe was his co-hort in the drug war and they find themselves together against the common enemy, but the trust is not felt between the two of them and the tension created is felt throughout the whole film!  Way to go, Tom Clancy! Truth needs a what?????????; Harrison Ford was a bad selection for this film, as many here have correctly pointed out. Equally revolting were the pretentious, often self-righteous references to Jack Ryan's \"honesty\". Example 1: \"truth needs a soldier\", the film's tagline. Or how about \"Jack, you see things in black and white.\"---\"Not black and white, right and wrong!!!!\" (groan). Or my personal favorite: \"That Ryan is such a boy scout.\" We get it, Jack doesn't lie, everyone else in Washington does. Now the combat scenes captured a bit more interest, but contained plenty of errors. The laser guided bomb dropped from a Navy fighter jet appeared way too fake (even though I didn't expect them to actually film a plane releasing munitions) and surely could have been improved. Also, wouldn't one expect the director of the FBI to have just a bit more security in a foreign country, particularly one as dangerous as Colombia, than three chevy trucks and two paltry motorbikes??? I won't go into the whole \"give me maps of their locations, cut off their communications\" bit, but even fiction has to recognize some boundaries of credibility. Two stars out of 4. Totally wonderful movie; Harrison Ford is the best.  He is one great actor and makes those Movies that he stars in unique and wonderful.  He puts so much of himself into his films that they could be nothing else.  Clear and Present Danger is full of action, good over evil and right prevailing.  The action is awesome, the storyline is up to date with current events and what is happening in the world today. Following up on The Hunt for Red October and going through to Patriot Games and The Sum of All Fears, the story of Jack and his uncommon belief in right vs wrong and that good should prevail is what makes this and the others such good movies. I own them all, I watch them over and over and never grow tired of them. An all-around good film; Harrison Ford returns to play Jack Ryan in good form. Clear and Present Danger was a good film with a good plot and is a worthy sequel of the previous Jack Ryan films. It was good, but Patriot Games was extremely good, and a little better. My Vote: 8 Your word is You; ***SPOILERS*** Spoting a yacht sailing erratically in the choppy waters off Florida the US Coast Guard has the boat boarded. On board they find that it's owner was murdered together along with his wife and two children by the group of Columbian drug traffickers who sea-jacked the craft. The man who together with his family that was murdered happened to be businessman Peter Hardin the Presdent of the United States Pres. Bennett, Donald Moffat, best friend. Outraged at what happened to his friend Pres. Bennett sets into motion a plan to get those who ordered Hardin and his family's murder with his top two advisor's Cutter & Ritter, Harris Yulin & Henry Czerny. To cover his and his advisor's behinds puts the now new CIA Deputy Director Jack Ryan, Harrison Ford, is put officially in charge. Ryan working together with the CIA comes up with the startling findings that Hardin, the presidents best friend, was a major money launder for the Cali Drug Cartel. Hardin using his business and banking expertise was skimming off the profits, that his bosses in the cartel needed to continue their operations, and that was the reason for his and his family's murder. Getting retired US Special Forces officer John Clark,Willen Defoe, to get a 12 man strike force to hit the Cali Cartel where it hurts, in it's drug processing operations,Ritter is going against Dept. director's Ryan's sworn testimony to the US Congress. Ryan testified that no US military personnel will be used to fight the Columbian drug dealers putting the unsuspecting Ryan in danger, if the operation is ever found out, of being indited for perjury, in him lying to the US Congress. As all these undercover dealings are going on the head of the Cali Cartel Ernesto Escobedo, Miguel Sandoval, chief counselor and ex-Castro intelligence agent Col. Felix Cortez, Jaquim de Almeida,is planing to set up his boss by getting him knocked off by the CIA. Cortez is also setting up rest of the Cartel leaders to be whacked by arraigning a major hit on the US governments representatives in Columbia. Later there's a Cortez sponsored attack in Bogata killing 5 Secret Service Agents and the the FBI chief Jacobs,Tom Tammi, with Cortez pining the attack on the \"innocent\" drug dealers. Cortez has his lover and FBI director Jacobs private secretary Moira Wolfson, Ann Magnuson, unwittingly give him the information of Jacobs whereabouts. This helps Cortez in having Jacobs trapped in a motorcade in downtown Bogata where he was gunned down. Cortez then plans to make a deal with the US, after he had the Cali Cartel leaders knocked off, to take over the cartel's operations and cut the drug supply to the US in half. Making the US government's drug fighting agency DEA and the FBI, as well as President Bennett, look like their \"War on Drugs\" is a big success to the American people, It turns out that Cortez's master plan miss-fires when it's discovered after a massacre of most of the cartel leaders, with the exception of Escobedo, that it wasn't a car bomb that was first reported by the news that did them in! It was a laser-guided missile, that could have only been used by the USAF, that did the job. With the sh*t hitting the fan all over D.C and the members of Congress demanding to know why the US military was involved in this unauthorized \"hit\" two things are quickly put into motion by presidential advisor's Cutter & Ritter 1. the US troops sent into Columbia are sold out by giving up their positions to the cartel mercenaries in order to have them all killed so they'll never live to tell the truth about their mission and 2. Jack Ryan is saddled with the blame for the secret operation with him made, by Cutter & Ritter, to look like he authorized it which he didn't. Despite it's very complicated plot \"Clear and Present Danger\" is a top rate political thriller that never lets up, or lets you down, in it's nerve racking suspense. The movie ends with two great final sequences with Jack Ryan having it out in Columbia with Cortez and his hoods in order for him and Clark, the head of the sold-out US troops, to save the remaining US soldiers held captive. The ending just flipped me, as I assume everyone else who saw it, out with an incredible confrontation between Ryan and President Bennett right in the Oval Office that has to be seen to be believed! It's here more then anywhere else in \" Clear and Present Danger\" where I hoped that for once, just this ONCE, that life would imitate art! nice mix of intrigue and action; President Bennett's friends are murdered by Columbian Cali cartel drug lord Escobedo. He seeks revenge by declaring them Clear and Present Danger. Presidential Adviser James Cutter and Bob Ritter sends John Clark (Willem Dafoe) and his team to direct bombs on the targets. It's a secret mission that neither Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) nor his mentor Jim Greer know about. Greer is sick with cancer. Ryan is appointed Deputy Director of Intelligence and sent down to Bogota. Meanwhile Escobedo has intelligence operative Félix Cortez who has inside info in the White House and plans of his own. It's an intriguing political espionage mixed with some well executed action scenes. The ambush in Bogota is terrific action. Joaquim de Almeida is a great villain. He has a great depth which is perfect for his double dealing. It's a well made Tom Clancy spy movie. Taut political thriller, but is something missing?; I admire what Tom Clancy has written over the years, and can appreciate the close detail he puts into his works. He is in tune with American politico and international affairs, but how can he make it more applicable to mainstream audiences? The answer is Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan, one of my favorite starring actors, one who is always alert to the atmosphere around him, and always seems coolly affected by his environment. \"Clear and Present Danger,\" the third Jack Ryan movie to date, uses Ford's talents at times to great effect, but at other moments seems to ignore him altogether. It is only after two hours of the film has surpassed that we see Ford command the screen, taking charge of his opponents. He didn't somehow resemble the Jack Ryan from the previous film, \"Patriot Games,\" at all. I'm not used to seeing Harrison in the background as much or noticing him dance around situations like a weakling, so I was kind of caught off guard. I felt a mild tinge of excitement from the film's plot, that of a militant force in Colombia and its threatening power over American affairs. Also, I was quite interested in Willem Dafoe's character and his longing to get out of the field of war, but even he wasn't emphasized to a great extent. The President's intervention in the conspiracy was not clearly brought to perspective enough to matter. \"Clear and Present Danger\" does have its moments, its turns of excitement and action sequences, but they come few and far between. Harrison Ford delivers a good performance out of what he is given, but I do not think he was used to the fullest advantage. Somehow, there seems to be a great film underneath this web of international intrigue and drug cartels, but I was unable to receive a satisfactory show. Rating: Two stars and a half. Boring 'thriller'; By definition, a thriller is meant to thrill. This 'thriller' fails to do so. Reprising his role as CIA hotshot Jack Ryan, Harrison Ford looks disinterested as he becomes involved in an undercover war between the American government and some naughty Colombian drug barons. Whereas Patriot Games conveyed some excitement to the viewer, this sequel fails to match that modest achievement. I found myself counting down the minutes till the end. There are endless dull and 'meaningful' conversations in this film, all of which are of no interest to those who crave a bit of glamour and fun from a movie. This film could have been 90 minutes long, edited for action and injected with a little humour. The absence of any real humour actually harms the film the most. A Clint Eastwood or a Kiefer Sutherland would have portrayed Jack Ryan with a touch of class and the odd laugh, but Harrison Ford just bores the audience senseless. The cast is good and the plot could have been developed into something of interest, but I was left feeling empty from viewing this sorry rubbish. It takes itself too seriously. Despite it only being 12 years old, I felt this movie was incredibly dated, more so even that the older Patriot Games. I guess in recent years I have been spoilt by the excellent and always compelling 24. Things have clearly moved on.

Unclear is this Present Danger **1/2; Harrison Ford in this disappointing film about the affects of a Colombian cartel group dealing with drugs. Ford gets a top job at the CIA when the director (James Earl Jones) develops a terminal illness. It seems that the President and his assistant are involved in a covert war in Colombia when they are denying this. Ford, their dupe, appears before Congress and is questioned by the late Hope Lange, who portrays a U.S. senator in one brief scene. The action really starts when an adviser goes to Colombia to negotiate getting back U.S. money. He is murdered there and his assistant, possibly his lover, is found dead the same day as he is killed. The film falls into other Tom Clancy books made into films. There is plenty of action but a lack of cohesiveness. pretty good Clancy adaptation; 'Clear and Present Danger' is full of great scenes which never really come together to make a great movie. It's trying to tell too many different stories and so, even with nearly two and half hours screen time, each story feels too short and incomplete. There are at least a half-dozen major plot threads running concurrently; give the director credit for at least TRYING to fit everything that matters in from another of Tom Clancy's super-fat bestsellers. The other problem though is Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford). He is not the action hero of 'Patriot Games.' Here, he is a dupe at first, then a decoy at the end, and in between sort of a standard-issue government official (albeit a rare honest one). John Clark (Willem Defoe) is the closest thing to a 'hero' present. There is a large ensemble cast, everyone has a role to play, and Ryan frankly is reduced to being just another member of that ensemble. In short, the US President orders (without stating so explicitly, to cover his own butt) a covert military operation against drug cartels in Colombia. Clark heads up a small, elite squad that then begins going around blowing up labs and generally disrupting the drug business. In apparent retaliation, the FBI director and his entourage are killed in their motorcade while on a visit to Bogota. A Cuban intelligence expert working for one of the drug lords approaches National Security Adviser Cutter (the president's right-hand man) for a truce, and a deal-in exchange for his cutting drug exports to the US in half, he wants the inserted military team cut off and abandoned, so he can kill them. As mentioned, there are several other side-plots (Admiral Greer has terminal cancer, an FBI secretary is seduced by the Cuban intelligence agent and murdered) so there is a lot of jumping back and forth among the various players and situations. Among the best scenes is the ambush of the FBI director's motorcade in Colombia; very well-staged and realistic, it's a real nail-biter of a sequence. But there are several other good action set-pieces as well. 'Clear and Present Danger' does not seem as long as it is. It's just too bad the director, Philip Noyce, and the trio of screenwriters couldn't make the film a more cohesive package and found better ways to pump up Ford's role. After 'The Hunt for Red October' and 'Patriot Games,' we have certainly come to expect more from the Jack Ryan character than to be a fall-guy for a slippery Prez and his corrupt underlings, even if he belatedly turns the tables on them. Yet another god awful adaptation; I was once told if you don't have anything nice to say don't say it at all. Unfortunately there's nothing nice i have to say about this movie, and must let you know about the bad... John Clark is portrayed in this movie as some sleezy CIA mercenary, which is entirely untrue. The novels, while much better than this terrible movie, does go more into depth, the movie could at least given Mr. Clark some class. While this movie did stick closer to the original story than Patriot games, it was still terribly far off the mark. While i understand that for a movie some things do need to be deleted, the most important thing they got rid of was the backstory. The event's that set this story in motion are totally missing from the movie, which is truly unacceptable. Don't waste your time on this worthless flop of a film. Bad end action sequece....; The movie was very entertaining and educational but to be a classic in it's genre,it should have had better action sequences towards the end of the movie.Particularly the scenes of the daring rescue of the special forces from the Colombians.The thrill was there but the action was not powerfull enough which fans of this movie subject will definitely demand.Ford may be getting old but he can still pull off better action sequences than what was shown in this movie.Even the scenes where in the US special forces were defeated by the mercenaries could have been way better.The scenes where the CIA guys were ambushed in their vans was very good.They should have continued with those kind of sequences in the other action scenes.It was a bad decition to tone down the violence too much becouse the seriousness of the movie demands realism to become a classic.Still a good try.I know Ford did not like the way it was done as well and that is why he is reluctant as of now to play Jack Ryan again.Ford knows movies well.I give this one an 8 out of 10. Harrison Ford Returns To Play Jack Ryan; Harrison Ford returns to play Jack Ryan in this mega-hit from the summer of 1994. In this follow-up to Patriot Games, Ford gets involved in a scandalous illegal drug war in Columbia orchestrated by top government officials. As with any film over 2 hours long, there are a few slow moments in the movie. However, for the most part, the film stays on course with alternating action, drama, and suspense scenes. Anne Archer and Thora Birch return in more forgettable roles as Ford's wife and daughter. Several other colorful characters are present, especially Joaquim de Almeida as a sinister cartel figure. Willem Dafoe plays a great role as a CIA contact, who supplies the illegal firepower to attack the cartels. His role should have been developed more; he's on screen all too briefly. James Earl Jones also returns for a farewell performance as Greer, Ryan's mentor. Henry Czerny, Harris Yulin, and Donald Moffat make up the oily triumvirate that Faces Ford. The film has terrific action and suspense sequences, especially the cartel's open attack on Ford's government convoy in the SUV's and the computer battle where Ford tries to run off illegal government doings. Ford's actions are consistent with his character, in that, he never saves the day via extraordinary means by himself, as can be customary in these type of films. One of the few false notes is the sanctimonious tendency of Ryan to self righteously bear the torch of truth, when we all know that being in the CIA can compromise that possibility. *** of 4 stars. Another Entertaining and Action Packed Jack Ryan Adventure,; Clear and Present Danger is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a very talented cast.Harrison Ford returns as Jack Ryan for a second outing,and it's more intense and a lot more action than we saw in Patriot Games,Ford clearly still enjoyed playing Ryan and it shows in his performance.Anne Archer also returns as Jack Ryan's wife Cathy,and I find her as annoying as i did in Patriot Games,I haven't seen her in anything else and I know she's suppose to be a very good actress in other things,but I find her characters dialogue and just the way Archer delivers them very irritating and just unrealistic.Clear and Present Danger is action packed and very intense and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great action or thriller. After a close friend of the president of the United States is murdered,Jack Ryan gets involved in a war against a powerful drug cartel. Best Performance: Harrison Ford Worst Performance: Anne Archer A Major Turn Around in the Jack Ryan Series!; The first two Jack Ryan pictures failed to capture my interests in a spy flick but this movie didn't. While the plot really isn't out of this world. It is still a good plot which contains a lot of action sequences and with Harrison Ford on board there is a sense of adventure. I still haven't seen 'The Sum of all Fears' but this is the best and perhaps the only movie in the Jack Ryan series that I like so far. 3(***)out of 4(****)stars Great Clancy novel brought to life.; I have to say that ALL of the Clancy novels that were made into films, with the exception of \"The Sum of All Fears\" were brought to life as great films. Harrison Ford reprises his role as Dr. Jack Ryan, who is forced in this film to step into the shoes of Admiral Greer, who is dying. While there is a lot of each characters personal lives carefully inserted into the film, it NEVER ceases to be clever and interesting. It's much better to watch than any senseless action picture with Bruce Willis or your wimpy little Ben Affleckish character. The film is perfectly balanced so that there is not a single boring scene in the picture. The wheels are constantly turning to make sure something dramatic is happening to really draw you further into the picture. I recommend this movie as well as it's two predecessors, \"The Hunt for Red October\", and \"Patriot Games\". Both of which are equally brilliant. Good covert story of intrigue; How many things go on daily in government planning that we, the public, and, frankly, the media, never find out about. This film reminds us of this factor and I liked its constant attention to corruption at the highest levels of government. We all know its there, but a constant reminder of it is a good thing. The drug angle that Jack Ryan investigates, tied in with the secret hit squad hired to bring it own, put these events on a collision course that is unpredictable, highly suspenseful and tense. Willem Dafoe's character as the mercenary is my only complaint. Not a complaint against Dafoe but how his part was under written. A little more development would have helped the story nicely. Condensed Clancy; The makers of this movie are to be congratulated for turning a Tom Clancy doorstop into a tense, tightly woven international thriller with a top notch cast and believeable plot. Where the previous two Jack Ryan movies depended on stunts and quite unbelieveable plot twists this film concentrates on a grubby little military/political incident (more the domain of intelligence men) and the men of honour and integrity (Ford and an under used Dafoe) trapped in the middle of it. I also like this movie for its subtle dig at the American establishment and how it assumes it can coerce the weak into doing its bidding. The Clark character in Clancy's fiction is an interesting one and deserves to be further developed. Casting Willem Dafoe in the part was actually a stroke of genius, and I could easily imagine his character in Platoon doing this kind of work if he had survived Vietnam. The fact that Dafoe is one of THE most underrated actors in Hollywood also means I like this. John Clark and John Clark; I loved the movie. I've watched it many times. However, last night I noticed something strange. In Clear and Present Danger, Greer tells Jack Ryan to look up Clark when he gets to Bogota. Of course, Jack Ryan does meet John Clark. Supposedly, Jack Ryan has been with the CIA for some time now, considering the position he holds. Acutually, Ryan should know who Clark is. In the \"Sum of All Fears\", another great movie, which is supposedly a prequel, young Jack Ryan goes on a mission with John Clark. Therefore, in Clear and Present Danger, Jack Ryan already knows who John Clark is. Am I mistaken on this? Also, the \"Sum of All Fears\" is not shown as much as Clear and Present Danger. Standard but well made movie.; This is a good and above average political thriller with action elements in it. Still the movie gets a bit too complicated at times and isn't always easy to follow. The movie is also long and some point of the movie are dragging on, even though the pace always remains good and high. It's hard to say in which genre this movie can be put. For an action movie it doesn't have enough action and for a thriller the story isn't good enough. It makes \"Clear and Present Danger\" a bit of a mixed movie that is far from perfect but still remains a perfectly watchable movie with some great actors and some memorable moments. Main problem I had with the movie is that it lacked a distinctive visual style. A problem all Phillip Noyce movies always have. That's why I'm not a too big fan of Phillip Noyce movies, with the exception of \"Dead Calm\" maybe, which simply had a very solid and tense story. \"Clear and Present Danger\" is a good made movie but it just is too simply and standard done all and it isn't really anything new. The cast is great and has some big names in it; Harrison Ford, James Earl Jones, Harris Yulin, Donald Moffat, Henry Czerny, Joaquim de Almeida, Miguel Sandoval, Benjamin Bratt, Willem Dafoe, Ted Raimi in a small role and a still very young Thora Birch. The music by James Honer is really good. Even though it's typical Horner stuff, like he always used in his '90's movies, it works really well for the movie and truly uplifts the movie at times. There are some good moments in the movie that are highly memorable such as the convoy ambush which has become a bit of a classic already perhaps. Yes, the movie is perfectly watchable but the story isn't always the best to follow and at times the storytelling is lacking. Still, a movie that I would recommend to you. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ Politics: Put On Your Hip Waders!; Spoilers Ahead: My favorite Clancy based movie. It has such depth to it and also works on many levels. As a pure adventure movie, it is excellent. Yet, I adore the movie for a wonderful trip into the excremental world of politics. Even people from other countries, believe me, it has relevance to you. Politicians are just like this wherever on earth you go. My favorite line is Moffat's president, caught with his pants down, killing civilians in an illegal drug war, leaving his own soldiers out for target practice,\"Jack, you won't do that, you got yourself a chip in the big game now. You're going to save that for when your own ass in on the line and I'm going to cash that in for you.\" A well written movie that adumbrates the whole Iran / Contra drug store the White House was running with that great patriot who lived on the 5th amendment and the world's worst memory. You will pick up who Clancy is speaking about here's a big hint, listen for Ritter saying,\"There you go again,\" ring any bells? Notice what's on the president's desk that lovely jar of jelly beans? Beyond the thinly veiled look into the wonderful way to fund a clandestine army with cocaine, the movie is such an exciting, well written, suspenseful piece of work. With Dafoe and Earl Jones in support, you really get some great acting. Even if my analysis bores or you disagree with, it is worth owning. I like Patriot Games, except for the ending, but this towers over it. It stays with me because of the trip into the world of politics which Clancy's narrative has such a feel for authenticity about it. Even non philosophers have an innate sense of truth, I think that is why this was such a big hit. Czerny's Ritter is my favorite character what a great depiction of an amoral, ladder climbing, take no prisoners low life. This is the core of why the movie works so well, even during what should be slow parts at the White House. The movie moves very well, the politics are quite few and far in between. There are some great action set pieces; the attack on the Motorcade, the jet missile attack on the drug lords and the final rescue of the prisoners. Do not be fooled by my review, the politics take a back seat to the action filled story. Why you should watch it is for the depths. Be sure to put on your hip waders because you are going to be around politicians, hold your nose. The slime cannot be exaggerated; as scathing a delineation as this movie is, I still think it is even worse than this. It won't make you want to race out and vote. Ryan barely escapes with his skin when those government servants, who put the Mafia to shame, paint a giant bulls-eye on his backside. The showdown scene between Ryan and The President is worth owning the movie for. I loved all of them but the Ben Affleck one but this one is forty stories above the rest for what I would call: Into The World Of Politics Get Those Hepatitis Shots First. A Good Movie. One of my all time favorite movies; A CIA anaylst, Jack Ryan(Harrison Ford), is promoted to  Deputy Director of Intelligence of the CIA after Admiral James Greer(James Earl Jones) suffers from illness. A close friend of the president(Donald Moffat) is murdered. The situation gets worse when the President is convinced to take actions against the drug cartels. Felix Cortez plays both sides. He tries to \"inform\" the CIA and he also works with the cartels. James Cutter(Harris Yulin) an advisor to the President, makes a deal with Cortez, and cuts off communications to troops in Columbia, through the Deputy Director of CIA Operations, Robert Ritter(Henry Czerny). Ryan goes to Colombia to save the troops with the help of John Clark(Willem Dafoe),  but not before Ritter blames Ryan for Clark's men being captured by Cortez's mercenaries. Clear and Present Danger is a great action/political thriller that is one of my all time favorite movies. Ford gives a great performance, perhaps his best. Theres also a great supporting cast including Willem Dafoe, Henry Czerny, and James Earl Jones. Besides powerful drama, Clear and Present Danger supplies good action sequences. I haven't read the book, but I plan to after seeing this movie. Although the plot is a bit complex, this is a great movie and a must see. If you like Ford, action, or great drama, then Clear and Present Danger is a movie you should see. This film recieves my highest recommendation. 10/10 One of the better Harrison Ford movies, but not his best; I'm not going to say that Harrison Ford is my most favorite actor, but I sure like to see him play. That's why I've already seen several of his movies and that's also the reason why I gave this movie a try. I'm normally not too much a fan of action movies, but with him in one of the leading roles, you can always expect something more and better than some simple spectacle. \"Clear and Present Danger\" is a movie based on a Tom Clancy novel that tells the story of Doctor Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst who finds himself in the middle of a power struggle within the Colombian drug cartel as well as some dirty political games in the highest ranks of the American political establishment. It all starts with the murder of a close friend and his family of the American president aboard their yacht in the Caribbean, apparently in retaliation for stealing money as part of a money laundering scheme for the cartel. When some of the president's men convince the president to conduct covert actions against the cartel, without telling the Congress of course, and the security chief of one of the cartel bosses tries to play both sides by informing his boss, but trying to organize a coup against the cartel leadership with the help of the CIA at the same time, Ryan soon gets in a very difficult position. When he finds out the entire truth, he sets himself the almost impossible task to save the men that were left behind in the jungle, while trying to save his own reputation and life... Whether everything shown in this movie is possible or not, I can not really say. But one thing is for sure and that is that we certainly will not know everything the president of the USA is involved in or has knowledge of. I'm convinced that everywhere in the world, the CIA does play some dirty tricks so now and then, as long as it is beneficial for them and / or the country. So in that perspective I must say that this entire movie feels quite believable. And even though this isn't the best movie I've ever seen Harrison Ford play in, I must say that he did a nice job in this movie. His character is still believable, because he never seems to use any weapons and certainly isn't some kind of superman who can escape from entire armies without getting a scratch (although it sometimes started to look like it). I don't think the average CIA office worker is used to carry a lot of guns, machine guns, hand grenades, bazooka's or I don't know what other weaponry you sometimes see them use in all those cheap action flicks, so it's a good thing that they didn't have Jack Ryan carry them either. But there is one thing I don't really believe: I don't think that the CIA would ever send such a high ranking employee in the field. Nevertheless, Harrison Ford did a nice job with his role and the same can be said about Willem Dafoe, Anne Archer,... But in the end this is a bit too much an action movie to my taste, even though the action shots are certainly nice to watch. The story and the acting are OK and make that this movie is a lot better than the average action flick. That's why I give this movie a rating between 6.5/10 and 7/10. Not even political fiction, just plain reality; At first it looks like a banal drug film with some CIA agents trying to find out who killed a couple of people and why, people who were personal friends of the President of the US. Just that makes things tricky, I mean the fact that the victims were friends of the President of the US. Be discreet Jack. But things are also trickier than they look and I don't want to tell you the film. I am just going to give a few ideas about politics first. A politician always lies, by definition and by principle. It sounds pessimistic and it is. Never believe a politician, no matter what side he is on and what side you are on. A politician will always do what the circumstances will make him do under pressure. If he is wise he will listen to his advisers and he will think then. If he is not wise he will run into the wall and push with his head. He may break through, but anyway afterwards he will tell you tall tales. The second element is that you have to serve politicians, no matter what and just try to cover your back and by back I mean under your lower back. You can serve them well it does not matter. If there is a problem you will be the fuse. If the problem was big, you may be the fuse, but the politicians will get it on their heads. But that will not give you what you deserve: a medal and a premium for serving them well. The film brings up another line of reflection. Politicians do not give a damn about the life of the people who are defending the country or who are fighting just or unjust wars for their country. Politicians consider these fighters as pawns on their chessboard and if they die they are collateral victims of their own game. Too bad for them they were those who had to die. If they died with honor they might get some coverage and recognition, otherwise they might get buried under a pile of rocks in some jungle. Their families will be handed a casket full of stones. But beyond these fighters in uniform do not believe civilians are in any way considered in this matter. Civilians are not even collateral damage. They are just collateral garbage. And unluckily that's the fundamental point here. Who cares about children, women, and plain civilians. They should not have been here in the first place. Good riddance, next time they will not be dumb enough to be present on a future mass crime scene. That's how you get out of that film. And the last scene will not change anything. There is no justice in such a situation. You may see the politician who exploited you fall because his arrogance brings him down, but that will not be justice for you who will have footed the bill of that liar. So make up your mind and just accept to be used, over-used and abused by politicians: that's their fundamental function and you are a sucker by definition since you are not in politics. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID Not a good screenplay from book (contains spoilers); It's no wonder why Tom Clancy was angered with the making of his books into movies after Patriot Games. Many characters from the book were changed from the start of the movie. The movie was confusing for most audience members because it left out many chapters and sub plots from the book. In the book Jack Ryan does not find out the connection to the drug cartel until after the covert operation began because he never had a briefing with the President because the President had already made a statement of Clear and Present Danger. Ryan never meets Clark until after Escobedo's was bombed from an aerial strike. The movie also left out Samuel Jackson's character(Robby) out of the movie when he was a major part in the book discovering about the Covert Operation in Columbia. Harrison Ford Anne Archer and James Earl Jones reprized their roles with finesse. If you are an avid reader of Tom Clancy this movie will disappoint you. A Colombian's point of view; ---THIS MAY CONTAIN SMALL SPOILERS, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK-- This movie is quite believable. The plot I mean. The bad guys are there too, and the drug cartels life is in some way accurate. But it has a lot of disappointing details. Small details, like: - The president of the U.S. being emotional and taking a personal vendetta? - Isn't it naive to pretend to win a war against drugs with a commando force and taking down some drug lords? - Hollywood's ability to investigate and simulate real locations is frankly embarrassing. The have an ability to make fool of themselves for erratic representations and show their big ignorance with the way they show life in underdeveloped places. Bogota is characterized as a dusty, hot and poor city. Bogota is not dusty, not ugly and is cold. I've never seen places even close to the ones showed in the movie. They shoot in places in Mexico, but guys: Not everything below the great river looks like Mexico. Not every Colombian is a drug dealer, as I guess not every American is a junkie or an ignorant, neither stupid. But if we take what Hollywood shows looks that way. They might shoot the Bogota scenes in Mexico City, it is a lot more similar to the real Bogota. -You can see soldiers everywhere you go to. They show Bogota as a place where you can get killed by a sniper in any minute. Far away from the real thing, taking off the credibility of the movie, and also creating a false and erratic image of a whole country. - This lack of investigation from people involved in the representation of tropical countries is not new, and not over. \"The fockers\" is even more embarrassing, show a even bigger ignorance of how a country really is. For a production costing several millions of dollars, they might take the hassle to investigate a little more (at least investigate) and not to make fool of themselves. -A high rank CIA officer going to the jungle to rescue some soldiers and fist-figthing drug lords? Come on! And for the record: paramilitaries, guerrillas and Colombian soldiers use nice uniforms, in some way very similar to the U.S. soldier's ones. After all, those uniforms are made here too.. ;). And drug lords don't use bodyguards with cheap formal suits. They dress casual and classy too. Military Police uniforms were accurate, at least something good. Like it was said in the first part of the movie: \"as long as there are consumers, the will be someone providing you drugs, no matter where they come from\". That's why I liked the movie, it is a realistic story. Not very well represented (at least the Colombian part), but I've seen worst. Involving, although often too robotic, Ryan entry which knows what it has to do but often strikes us as to not knowing how to do it.; Where does one go after having taken on, and successfully parried, the threat of that of both Communism and Terrorism? Why, to wage war on Narcotics of course. At least, that is how the good folks charged with bringing to life the adventures of a C.I.A. agent named Jack Ryan see it, as too does the series original author Tom Clancy, whose source material I read was actually published on the brink of the Cold War's termination. With the Irish and the Soviets vanquished, that of Colombia's cocaine barons are next up on the chopping block for the world's most powerful intelligence agency. There is an eerie procession to things in that regard that mirrors today, an attitude of bountifully hopping from ideology to ideology; from nationality to nationality usurping the tyrants and conquering the odds not so far away from modern foreign policy: the action starts when things kick off that we like neither the looks or sounds of it. Clear and Present Danger is probably the most cryptic of the first three Ryan adaptations  I imagine its title is meant somewhat ironically, as there are times when things are anything but clear and the narrative can actually be quite overwhelming. Thankfully, this is not a case of the same stuff being regurgitated as Ryan charges about; does his thing and works everything out in the end. This is the sort of 'action' film whereby romping scores of circumstance and pomp put to sets heavy in the decour of American governmental iconography, as two men bicker and grimace intently over a situation, is discernible as the 'spectacle'. Things have moved on internally, also. Where in \"The Hunt for Red October\" Ryan was more of a middle man caught in a cross-fire who was charged with investigating and, ultimately, defusing a situation, his role changed dramatically in \"Patriot Games\", where he found himself an agent at the heart of a field operation. In Phillip Noyce's Clear and Present Danger, he has effectively been promoted to that of chief of operations following some health issues with James Earl Jones' evergreen \"M\" figure. The film begins where the last one culminated: at sea. An American Navy vessel flags down a luxury yacht which, to their horror, has been invaded by rouge South American Cartel members and has had its rightful owners executed. Where things suddenly become relevant is when this innocent party of murder victims are revealed to have been close friends to the American president, something which launches an investigation where previously these tyrants were getting away with the horrors associated with trafficking; smuggling and murder anyway. The leader of these renegades is a certain Ernesto Escobedo (Sandoval), who's a poor excuse for a Robert Davi villain from a then-not-too-recent Bond film about similar themes. Escobedo is rich; has a huge house; a loving family and enjoys baseball, but from within a certain Cuban aide by the name of Cortez (de Almeida) has his own ideas on Escobedo's empire. The film launches itself into too very distinct cuts of raw material, with on the one hand Ryan's task of leading the Cartel investigation dominating with a very blue, very cold Washington atmosphere as the snow and chilly conditions settle in just as equally cold levels of animosity are met with practically everything Ryan does via his peers. On the other, an elite team of SEAL commandos land in the warmer, greener and brighter South American jungles. The team is mostly made up of insignificant extras, although one such trooper of a sniper class gets his own introduction et al. early on; thus, it is of little surprise that he's the only one left upon which to focus when the mission gets messy later on. One item, of which there can be little doubt, is Harrison Ford's worthiness in the role. There is a moment early on when he walks into his superior's office; there is a smirk, some small talk and a pile of papers outlining the latest situation. Straight away, we're at home with him in the role and he brings a measured assuredness to the part. The film plays out with that invisible confidence films as cryptic as these often have, that nonchalant swagger as it dives into yet another scene drenched in conflict and suspicion; only assuming that you're keeping up but delivering the blows for you even if you haven't quite. It certainly reminds us of how good-a job the team made of The Hunt for Red October, which was equally involving in this regard although always had the benefit of things zeroing in on that lone submarine so things were never going to be able to go too far astray in the first place. To another extent, it highlights just how limp in comparison to \"Hunt\" Patriot Games was; a revenge film which is made to look fairly bog-standard and unspectacular in comparison in spite of its traversing of the globe and its taking of its characters to some pretty dire emotional places. Perhaps that was the point; Noyce has essentially overcompensated in that regard, lumping onto us more of what we thought we got in \"Hunt\" that we didn't get any of in \"Games\"  something that was Noyce's fault in the first place. As a result, I think it finds a comfortable spot in-between the two. A commercial thriller that lacks intelligence and ignores complexity but is still entertaining and provides good thrills on the Hill and in the jungle; When Admiral Greer is diagnosed with cancer, Jack Ryan finds himself as Acting Deputy Director of Intelligence at the same time as one of the President's personal friends is murdered by a Columbian drugs cartel. Despite the suggestion that his friend was involved in illegal money laundering the President gives the \"unofficial\" nod to National Security Adviser Cutter who falsifies a Presidential Order for Robert Ritter to employ a covert operation to strike at Escobedo's operations in Columbia. Meanwhile Ryan goes before the Senate to get funding for the fight on drugs  although the funding does not include troops or direct action, which doesn't concern Jack as he is out of the loop on the covert op. While Jack tries to trace the money on the laundering, Clark's men get bombing in the Columbia jungle. However as things start to get out of control, political backs get covered, plausible deniability kicks in and both Ryan and Slater find themselves exposed and in danger. Despite Ryan's outings in Patriot Games and Sum of All Fears being roundly average at best, I decided to try this film and I actually found it quite easy to enjoy. The first thing to state is that it is very safe and commercial thriller in that, for all its supposed commentary on corruption and drugs, it really doesn't say much and the good guys and bad guys are painted very clearly and the lines between them are clean. Those familiar with the much more interesting look at America and drugs presented in HBO's The Wire will not find the same level of intelligence or comment in this film. Of course this doesn't make this a bad film, but perhaps a weaker one. The plot uses these clear lines and turns in an enjoyable if basic mix of political drama and action thrills. I found myself quite gripped by some parts and the plot regularly throw up tough talking and action to keep things interesting. Although Ford is already looking a bit older, he fits in perfectly on the \"intelligence\" side of the film but when he is called into action on the streets of Columbia then he doesn't look the part at all. Much better at this is Dafoe, who spends the majority of this in his own little action movie. He is convincing and was a good call for the role, although it doesn't help that the material calls for Ford to occupy equal status with him in the action stakes. Providing the political tough talk with good turns are Czerny, Yulin and Moffat  each would have benefited from the script recognising the complexities of right and wrong but this wasn't the place for that. Almedia and Sandoval are both pretty average but they are handed half-cooked clichés to work with so it isn't really their fault. Overall this is a perfectly serviceable commercial thriller and I have no doubt that those who accepted the problems in Patriot Games and Sum of All Fears will find this easy to enjoy. Personally I would have liked a bit more intelligence instead of the black/white approach but it still worked for what it was and it was effective in catching me up. A truly American film.; An excellent film, with the always outstanding Harrison Ford at the helm, Clear and Present Danger is the third of Tom Clancy's works to be adapted to the big screen and the second with Ford as Jack Ryan, the patriotic ex-marine turned politician. With the CIA director - played by the James Earl Jones - befallen by pancreatic cancer, Jack Ryan is 'promoted' to acting CIA director in his absence. Once there he becomes involved - unbeknownst to him - in a series of plots that answers the question of what would happen if the United States used some of its brawn to do what is morally right if not politically right, the covert eradication of drug producers in Columbia. Complete with a powerful and brutal scene where American policy makers are caught in an ambush in a run down section of Bogota that is sure to surprise and thrill you. Willem Dafoe does a terrific job of playing Joe Clark, who those of you familiar with Clancy's work will undoubtedly know. Harrison Ford, the Reluctant Action Star; CIA Analyst Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) is drawn into an illegal war fought by the US government against a Colombian drug cartel. James Berardinelli remarked, \"Clear and Present Danger is all plot and no characters. The people running around on screen have about as much depth as the sheen of sweat on Harrison Ford's forehead. Jack Ryan is the most disappointing of all. He's disgustingly virtuous: a flawless fighter for good and justice, a Superman without the cape. I spent half the movie wondering if this guy was ever going to show anything to mark him as vaguely human.\" That just seems too harsh, and for no good reason. This is an action film, after all. Sure, we do not get the depth we might like from Jack Ryan, but we have already developed him in two prior films. This is action, a spy thriller. We need twists, turns, gunfire and explosions! (And we get them, too.) Read the book, don't watch the movie; It's not hard to see why Tom Clancy doesn't give his approval to the movie that are based on his books. There isn't a single plot line in the book that the movie doesn't butcher. The cast is good, and if the movie had actually followed the book, the movie could have been great.  I hate to criticize Harrison Ford movies, but this one disappointed me. Thrilling!; Based on the book of the same name by Tom Clancy, 'Clear and Present Danger' is a thrilling film, that is neatly written, tautly directed & superbly acted. In short, Amongst the Finest Films from 1994! As in the novel, Jack Ryan is appointed Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Acting Deputy Director and discovers that he is being kept in the dark by colleagues who are conducting a covert war against drug lords in Colombia. Jack Ryan is a great hero to root for. Tom Clancy has indeed given us an Iconic Good-Guy, who in many ways, is a time-less personality. 'Clear and Present Danger' begins superbly and ends with a bang. The Writing Material is so Sharp, that it catches your attention right away. Also, The tense moments as well as the action-sequences, are wonderfully shot & executed. Phillip Noyce's Direction is taut. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is good. Art Design is perfect. Performance-Wise: Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan, is in full form. The Screen Legend delivers a terrific performance from start to end. Willem Dafoe is first-rate. Anne Archer is impressive. James Earl Jones is dignified. Miguel Sandoval leaves a mark. Others lend able support. On the whole, A Winner! Check It Out! The Clear and Present Danger for me was being put to sleep at times  with this movie.; The movie was not all bad, but compared to the other two Clancy movies I have seen (Patriot Games/The Hunt for Red October) this one was by far the least entertaining and least interesting of the bunch. It is also not very memorable as I have a hard time recollecting much about it aside from William Defoe's rather good performance and Harrison Ford as a not quite as intense Jack Ryan as he was in the \"Patriot Games\". Anne Archer is back as well, unfortunately she may as well not be in the movie at all as they have basically assigned her a cameo appearance in this one which is sad considering how much of a factor she was in the previous movie. Still, that is understandable as she may have not played all that an important of a role in the novel either. The action comes in small doses and there is a particularly good one featuring a bunch of cars being blocked in and a missile launcher, however the connection I felt with the characters in \"Patriot Games\" is lost so none of the action scenes really reel me in as they did in the previous two movies as the characters are not as interesting as say those in \"The Hunt for Red October\". Still thanks to William Defoe and some good action here and there it is not a total loss in the least. A good thriller.; Clear and Present Danger is part of the continuing chronicles of the life of CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford).(spoilers) It follows how the government starts a war against the drug cartels in Colombia. The only catch is the Colombian government doesn't know about it. This movie is better than I've reviewed it and it has lots of action. Though don't expect a lot similarities between it and the book it has a lot but not all of them. 6 *'s out of 10 *'s. Does not work for me!; The third installment in the cinematic incarnation of Tom Clancy's CIA analyst Jack Ryan and the second starring Harrison Ford, this follow-up to Patriot Games is a more complex, rewarding, and bolder film than its predecessor. Ford returns as Ryan, this time embroiled in a failed White House bid to wipe out a Colombian drug cartel and cover up the mess. The script, by Clancy and John Milius (Red Dawn), has an air of true adventure about it as Ryan places himself in harm's way to extract covert soldiers abandoned in a Latin American jungle. There are a couple of remarkable set pieces expertly handled by Patriot Games director Phillip Noyce, especially a shocking scene involving an ambush on Ryan's car in an alley. The supporting cast is superb, including Willem Dafoe as the soldiers' leader, Henry Czerny as Ryan's enemy at the CIA, Joaquim De Almeida as a smooth-talking villain, Ann Magnuson as an unwitting confederate in international crime, and James Earl Jones as Ryan's dying boss. The DVD release has a widescreen presentation, theatrical trailer, closed captioning, optional French soundtrack, and optional Spanish subtitles. Good enough.; It was \n",
       " decent. After \"The Hunt for Red October\", this is the best Clancy movie so far. This is not saying much though since these movies have either been amazing or awful (yes, I'm talking about the last one). It stays true to the book, the plot development is a bit slow so you need to be patient. As true to a Clancy novel, there is no \"one guy saves the world\" type of thing here. Good people die, bad people die, neutral people die. The conclusion is bittersweet, more like a pyrrhic victory, which I like. I must admit it, getting a Tom Clancy novel in script form is not easy since his works tend to be very, very complex, with multiple sub-plots. However, they did a great job on this one. It's not a 10 but it is an solid 8. Dullest of the series.; Jack Ryan III confirms why he can't be a James Bond for the nineties - he's just too boring, although Ford does try his hardest. A relic of its time; It's really amazing just how bad a great many films used to be. The acting is typically staid, apparently intended to replicate the faux-seriousness of CNN. None of the characters really make sense. I found the drug lord to be the most entertaining one of them all. Is this an action film? Then it's a mediocre one. There are some good fight scenes, and the explosions are nifty, but it's all pretty much irrelevant to the story. Is it a political intrigue? I guess, but the story just wasn't that compelling to me. So, somebody made a deal with some rich guy to launder money, then ... murder and war? Whatever. Ultimately, this was an attempt to make a violent parallel to Watergate, which no coincidentally was also as hopelessly impossible to understand. But, back the early 1990s, the media was desperate to relive the Watergate golden days. As unbelievable as the show is, it makes sense in a historical context. Clear and Present Danger; Ford returns as CIA Jack Ryan who now combats Colombian drug  cartels in this entertaining film version of the Tom Clancy novel. While entertaining, Ford is beginning to show his age with these roles. The worst installment of a bad series; Film adaptations of Tom Clancy's bestselling novels have never really measured up to the success of the books and this third film outing of Clancy's most popular character, CIA agent Jack Ryan, ranks as the worst adaptation of all. The book of the same name was the bestselling novel of the 1980's but probably one of the worst films of the 1990's. Harrison Ford reprises his \"Patriot Games\" role as Ryan. This time out, Ryan works to uncover and expose a working connection between a South American drug ring and an advisor for the U.S. President. Long before this dull film was over, it didn't really matter to me anymore how it was going to turn out. Most other viewers may feel the same way here. Stick with the novels because the film adaptations are just not as engrossing for some odd reason. This movie is superficial, biased and deceitful.; Oh my god. This movie is just another proof of how some people don't give a damn about making stories that respect people and at least show a little truth about other countries and cultures. This movie's representation of Colombia is just like Americans like to see people that they consider inferior, and criminal, thus, subject to be humiliated by means of a pathetic motion picture. This movie shows American, or Hollywood's, total ignorance about Colombia and the whole drug trafficking problem. I know is just a movie, but people around the world, naive or stupid people, believe in what movies show like if it was God's truth. Sure, this is just another action movie with predictable characters and plot, nothing to be studied further. Nonetheless, it hurts to see movies that only promote hatred and discrimination against Colombians. This picture shows the way Hollywood works: \"you can sell people crap, and make them eat it\" Jack is back; \"Clear and Present Danger\" is the second adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel to feature Harrison Ford as CIA agent Jack Ryan. This film involves a murder which is linked to drug cartels in Colombia and the subsequent efforts to take action against the cartels. Harrison Ford proves again that he is well-suited to the role of Jack Ryan and more appropriate than Alec Baldwin and Ben Affleck for the role. There are some great supporting performances as well, particularly from James Earl Jones, Willem Dafoe and Henry Czerny. Henry Czerny developed an interesting character and the rivalry between him and Jack Ryan was excellent. The story of this film is better developed than that of \"Patriot Games\" (1992), which is why I prefer this film. It goes beyond a simple \"Jack Ryan combats criminals\" story. There is not a lot of intrigue per se, but some interesting turns and friction between Ryan and officials within the United States government. There are also some well-made action sequences in the film to supplement the story. The film's ending was interesting and appropriate. \"Clear and Present Danger\" proved to be more interesting than its predecessor film, \"Patriot Games\" (1992). A course of action, that he can suggest....he can't.; Harrison Ford. Willem Dafoe. Anne Archer. James Earl Jones. Benjamin Bratt. Henry Czerny, Harris Yulin as a 'heavy' (National Security Adviser : James Cutter ) and Dean Jones. They have a cast of old school heavies and new talent all together. I hadn't seen Dean Jones in a while and he was fantastic! There is a 'chilling weight', that scores the film visually from the onset. The director Phillip Noyce, uses broad scenery (from what I can tell) it brings out a feeling of grandness, vast and encompassing. It just sort of takes control of the mind and vision. The story of a Cartel from Columbia taking 'Liberties' on a family that wound up unbeknown to Escabedo (the Cartel scumbag) being friends of the President of The United States of America. Violent liberties that have become deadly serious. A Cali Cartel. A decision, that the President discusses with his defense secretary. A course of action that he (The President) can't suggest, is exactly what he is suggesting, behind closed doors. Being inside the White House in a Tom Clancy /Phillip Noyce film always seems very real for me, as I watch the government employees walk and talk and what ever else. This has to be one of the highest Clancy novel/ movies that I have seen, just above \" Patriot Games \". Czerny is so good at being maligned. He is the one you don't want to be in a face-off with in a CIA office. He truly brings out a roundly compelling performance as Deputy Director of the C.I.A. ' Robert Ritter' . Deception, is all around. like a sort of wall-papering. Who can Jack trust when he must? This is a powerful story and a dramatic and strong ending that completes the story from start to middle and ending. I was very enthusiastic and impressed, by the directing performance, photography and music score. The film crew that worked on 'Patriot Games' (1992) was retained for this one too. I saw an inside interview about the production of 'Clear and present danger' and the Producer stated that Harrison Ford performed his driving stunt, during the ambush!! And in regard to that beautiful drug dealer home in the country, get this...it was not 'CGI' special effects, they actually blew the house to bits!!!! Yes, it was real too. Now thats how to make a top-end action adventure/ thriller, in my book. Can you believe this, of all the Ten and twenty million dollar salaries that Ford makes in his work, he barely got paid one-million for this body of work. This is a keeper. Recommended again and again. (*****) Another Winner Based on a Tom Clancy Novel.; Another intense winner from novelist Tom Clancy that is intelligent, complicated and well-made. Once again Jack Ryan returns (Harrison Ford) and this time he must take on a Colombian drug cartel that has murdered a close friend of the U.S. president (Donald Moffat). The president then sends a task force into Colombia to fight the cartel without the knowledge of Congress. This is of course an illegal act which will lead to problems at home and abroad. The task force, led by Willem Dafoe, fails and it is up to Harrison Ford to make all things right again. The film is smart, but truly confusing at times. Ford once again shines and he gets ample support from a strong cast. The direction is focused and the film ends up being another interesting action-thriller. 4 stars out of 5. Blah; I don't know why, but this movie failed to hold my interest. I like all of the cast members, the photography and direction seemed OK, and the book it was based on was great. It just didn't seem to come together. Willem Defoe did well in his role, although I agree that he was miscast, from the perspective of the book. True, you can't film a whole Clancy novel without making a 40 hour movie, but \"Hunt for Red October\" made a very good film. I haven't seen \"Patriot Games\" so I cannot comment on that. Grade: D Enemies Within And Without; Someone once said that absolute power corrupts absolutely. That saying is the theme at the heart of Clear And Present Danger, the third film in the Jack Ryan film series. With a near perfect combination of acting, action, music and script it is also a thriller of the highest quality. Harrison Ford takes his performance of Jack Ryan up to a new level with this film. His performance as the principled Ryan stays int eh front seat at all times as Ryan confronts those in the film, especially in the final scenes of the film. Ford is also at the top of his game in the action sequences of the film as well proving yet again that Ford is both a fine actor and a fine action hero as well. The rest of the cast is good as well. Willem Dafoe makes a welcomed good guy appearance as Clark, the mysterious CIA operative leading the secret war. Anne Archer makes a welcomed return as Cathy Ryan though she is underused sadly. There's also Henry Czerny and Harris Yulin as the me leading the war of behalf of their President (played expertly by Donald Moffat) plus there's Joaquin De Almeida, Miguel Sandoval, Raymond Cruz, Tim Grimm and of course James Earl Jones. In truth the whole cast is good enough to mention if there was enough space. Of course there's the action sequences of the film. Of special mention is the signature ambush sequence that easily belongs amongst the best action sequences ever dedicated on a frame of film. While that sequence alone is excellent one can't forget about the many other (and smaller) sequences in the film that are no less impressive. Overall though it is unfair to call this an action film by any means. If anything can this describe this film it is the words \"thriller of the highest quality\". The screenwriters took Tom Clancy's superb novel, trimmed down to film length, but kept many of the novel's key points. The result is, when put together with Phillip Noyce's direction and the superb score of James Hormer, an intelligent thrill ride where the corruption of absolute power leads to a secret war with lives and the reputations of nations at stakes where enemies are both within and without with only one man capable of unraveling it all. Clear And Present Danger is a thriller of the most unusual kind. It is a thriller that (in the words of Jack Ryan) sees the world not in black and white but as right and wrong. With its tale of a secret war and hidden agendas, the film is all the better for it. It may even be the best of the Jack Ryan films made so far but don't take my word for it. Go see the film for your self. The war on drugs gets a Machiavellian make-over.; In a Machiavellian storyline, Jack Ryan (played by Harrison Ford) is embroiled in a political agenda to cut off the Columbian Drug Lords and get \"revenge\" for the US president - whose friend was been murdered by \"drug tsar\" Ernesto Escobedo (played very well by Miguel Sandoval). The plot is very good and reminds viewers that even politicians can be the bad guys - but I think it overplayed the whole \"Ryan is good\", perhaps Clancy was annoyed by the rhetoric of politicians and decided to write a novel about it. The action sequences are very well done too, but it tries too hard to be a suspenseful political action-adventure movie by incorporating ideas and themes from all the other Jack Ryan movies and putting them into one box. I don't mind the fact its not the book, I thought this was a very good film about political agendas and the war on drugs. During the film we see Escobedo and Ryan team up - but I thought this would be a novel thing to have in future films and novels - Ryan's contact in Columbia just happens to be the country's top drug lord....but it was not to be. Anyhow - I thought this was a good political action-adventure movie that perhaps tried a little too hard on the action. Overall: 6/10. Top-notch Political Thriller; Clear and Present Danger is an exciting addition to the world of Jack Ryan, delving deep into the world of international politics. Nail-biting suspense and explosive action sequences add to the movie, with some truly awesome military special operations added to the mix as well. The inner conflict between acting CIA Deputy Director Jack Ryan and Robert Ritter is extremely entertaining, Harrison Ford and Henry Czerny play their parts impeccably, as do Willem Dafoe as John Clark, James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer and Raymond Cruz as cool soldier Domingo Chavez. Do not miss this top-notch political thriller! Harrison Ford on form in an excellent movie; I have read some quite negative reviews of this film, with many being upset by the lack of coherence with the book despite taking it's characterisations etc...I agree that the film does not follow the book particularly well but it is a film, for film watchers, not a book or a film for book readers so stop criticising it on that level. This film is entertaining from start to finish with a surprisingly clever plot considering the genre and credit must go to Ford for starring and excelling in yet another blockbuster. People may say he's not the most versatile actor in the world and I'm not going to disagree, but he does what he does brilliantly and those who don't enjoy this movie really do need a good talking to. Along with Patriot Games, this is part of an impressive set of movies which are far more entertaining than the books (perhaps thats because I'm not an avid reader) and shall keep all you viewers out there happy, if only for a short while. better than Patriot Games,but still pretty slow and boring; while i don't think this is a great movie,i do think it is better than the the last one,Jack Ryan film,Patriot Games.in Clear and Present Danger,Harrison Ford once again plays Jack Ryan.this one has a bit more intrigue than Patriot Games,and i also like the story more.it is more developed.to me,this one has a bigger scope.there is bit more urgency as well.having said that,i still think this movie is boring and slow,more often than not.Like Patriot Games,it's certainly not awful,but again i think maybe something got lost in the translation from Tom Clancy's novel.it's also almost 2 and a half hours long,and i think they could have trimmed some of it.still,it has it's good moments.for me,Clear and Present Danger is a 6/10 Role made for Ford; The gung-ho, heroic CIA intellignece offer Jack Ryan is a role made for Harrison Ford. Involved in a conspiracy within the US government that goes right to the top, he does overplay the righteous hero a bit much, but an enjoyable triller all the same. Good thriller; I think this is the best of the four Jack Ryan films. After seeing Clear and Present Danger, it is clear and present to me that director Phillip Noyce learned from his few mistakes in Patriot Games. This movie is faster, stronger, and more interesting. Harrison Ford gives another solid performance. There is less of a character to Ryan in this screenplay, but he also strikes me as more heroic. We end up rooting for him rather than just watching him. So far we have seen Ryan take on the Soviet Navy and the IRA, this time he gets involved with a Columbian drug lord. There is one potential problem with Clear and Present Danger. The movie requires just as much from the audience as it gives them. There is entertainment to be had here, but only if you pay close attention. The plot is complex, and fairly easy to get lost in. I personally don't see what is so hard about paying attention to a film, but with the action genre, I think people prefer to be entertained in a mindless eye candy kind of way rather than a thought provoking-thriller kind of way (but that's just my bias). Clear and Present Danger is still a good movie. Whether you are into the Jack Ryan novels or not, I'd recommend it. An interesting, but sometimes slow, sequence for \"Patriot Games\"...; Harrison Ford plays again the agent Jack Ryan, in this good, but a little unsuccessful, sequence for \"Patriot Games\". Directed by Philip Noyce, the same film maker who conducted the first one of the series and counting with an interesting supporting cast, \"Clear and Present Danger\" deserves to be seen, specially for a few excellent action moments (there is a particular impressive part, in which the CIA agents are caught between a shooting among the traffickers) and for the nice Harrison Ford's performance. If you didn't check the original, I recommend you to rent \"Patriot Games\" first, so you can understand the story.The bad points reside in the bad rhythm and in the confused direction by Noyce, who made a great work in \"Patriot Games\", but here accomplishes a decent, but not memorable work.Harrison Ford is a good actor and he has presence, but his character doesn't seem tough and hard enough. Not perfect, but clearly good.; Having read Tom Clancy's book, I noticed many differences with the movie (Cortez and Moira die in the movie, there is only one covert team in the movie instead of four in the book, Ritter is portrayed much more despicably in the movie, etc). I did not have a problem with most of these; the lone exception involved the death of Dan Murray in the movie. The only problem: In Clancy's later works, he becomes FBI Director Murray. So, who will conduct the seance for the next movie? Also, a language problem occurs in the film. Before I get to that, now is a good time for me to point out the show-stealers of the film, the bad guys. Yes, Harrison Ford turns in a quality performance, but Joaquim de Almeida (Cortez) and Miguel Sandoval (Ernesto Escobedo, the drug lord) are 100% believable, Escobedo as a reckless, scared bully and Cortez as a smooth-talking double-crosser who will eliminate anyone in his way. Now, on to the language problem: At the beginning of the movie, Cortez and Escobedo speak to each other in Spanish. Then, inexplicably, they resort to English for the rest of the movie. Even the guards at Escobedo's gate speak to each other in English when Ryan comes to see Escobedo. Cortez, when he yells to Escobedo's men that Ryan has killed Escobedo (it was Cortez's bodyguard), speaks to Escobedo's men in English. Message to the director: There are subtitles. You used them at the beginning of the movie. You should have continued this usage. Overall, though, the film is well-done, and I watch it whenever I catch it on television. clear and present danger background and commentary; In the 1980s, the United States, as well as many of its neighboring Latin American nations, began to feel the affects of the Columbian drug trade. Columbia was home to the Medellín and Cali drug cartels, both of which were deeply involved in the production and distribution of cocaine. The nation profited from the drug trade, as the cartels made lucrative gains by means of its unofficial protection from the Columbian government. The United States was especially accessible to the Columbian drug trade, as both coasts could be reached with relative ease. While the United States infiltrated Central American nations in attempts to tinker with the regional politics, there is no documented evidence of American presidents authorizing covert entries and operations into Columbia The action film Clear and Present Danger, deals with the issue of the American war on drugs, however, a large portion of the plot action takes place in Columbia. The film begins aboard a large white yacht with the death of an American family. The paterfamilias of the deceased family happens to be a close friend of the President of the United States. At this point, viewers are introduced to the hero, CIA analyst and family man Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford), who has been promoted to the position of Deputy Director of Intelligence, a position he inherits from his Agency mentor, Admiral James Greer (James Earl Jones). The film then moves to the Presidents issuing of an order to assemble a team of elite Hispanic commandos to infiltrate Columbia and wage a silent war on drugs. Here the audience first meets John Clark (Willem Dafoe), a mysterious black ops veteran who will train and lead the team of soldiers in Columbia. His soldiers are later dropped into the Columbian jungle where they begin their campaign with Dafoe running as their control officer from the city, reporting back to Bob Ritter, CIA's Deputy Director of Operations. The plot twist comes in the form of a man named Felix Cortez, a Cuban intelligence officer turned mercenary who serves as the intelligence officer for the cartel in the film. After a cartel meeting is bombed by an American jet, Cortez travels to the United States, where he begins to extract information through an illicit affair with the head of the FBI's secretary, Moira Wolfe. While on a romantic weekend trip, he discovers that the United States bombed the meeting, thus ending his need for the woman. He kills her and proceeds to blackmail the National Security Adviser, James Cutter, into cutting communications with the American soldiers. Jack Ryan discovers the whole operation while at the CIA, confronts Ritter, and then goes to Columbia to save them. When he arrives, he meets up with John Clark, who, under the belief that Ryan discontinued the communications, ties him up and nearly kills him. The two men then embark on a journey to find the soldiers, and eventually find Ding Chavez, hiding alone near a jungle stream since his comrades have all been shot or captured. These three then storm Cortez' compound to rescue the other soldiers and make their subsequent escape. While Clear and Present Danger is an entertaining film, it wildly strays from the novel on which it is based. Tom Clancy's storyline is much more in depth then the plot line of the movie. Some stark differences between the two include the deaths of Dan Murray and Moira Wolfe. In the film, Dan Murray is killed on a trip to Columbia that nearly results in the death of Jack Ryan as well. Dan Murray, according to Clancy's novel, is simply an up-and-coming FBI agent and friend of Ryan's. The FBI personality murdered in Columbia in the novel is Emil Jacobs, Director of the FBI. In the movie, Moira Wolfe's apparent death violently betrays the novel, for not only does she live, the novel ends with Ms. Wolfe traveling to Guantanamo Bay to see her \"lover\" Cortez, being escorted into the prison gates and eventually handed over to Cuban authorities. Driven a Ford lately?; CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER (1994) *** Harrison Ford, Willem Dafoe, Anne Archer, James Earl Jones, Joquim DeAlmeida, Ann Magnuson, Henry Czerny, Donald Moffat, Harris Yulin, Miguel Sandoval.  Superb adaptation of Tom Clancy's high-tech thriller with CIA analyst extraordinairre Jack Ryan (Ford reprising his role from \"Patriot Games\") up to his neck in a double-crossing cat and mouse set-up involving South American drug cartels and political machinations.  Intelligent script and some true edge-of-your seat moments. A so-so film that's worth watching.; Third installment of the Jack Ryan series takes place as Ryan (Harrison Ford) who takes over for his ailing mentor, Greer (James Earl Jones) and investigates the murders of a U.S. businessman (and his family) who was a friend of the current President (Donald Moffat) and had secret ties to a Colombian drug lord (Miguel Sandoval).  Ryan is aware that a fellow CIA employee, Cutter (Henry Czerny in a devilish performance) throws Ryan into the middle of a cover-up after a small band of U.S. soldiers and numerous innocent civilians have been killed.  Ford is okay here as Ryan, but Willem Dafoe (\"Shadow of the Vampire\") manages to steal the show as John Clark, a clever and reliable field operative who originally thinks that Ryan found out about his small operation in Colombia and pulled the plug on it.  The film becomes fun to watch in the second half as Ryan, Clark, and Chavez (Raymond Cruz), a sniper bail out the remaining members of Clark's squad out of Bogota.  Overall, \"Clear and Present Danger\" is a so-so film that's worth watching. Ryan is the best Ford Character ever; Wow i'm vote no 5000 a lot of people must love this movie too. Harrison Ford has played some great characters over the last 25 years but Jack Ryan rocks. As far as Tom Clancy stories go the Jack Ryan ones are the greatest. I just hope that more Ryan movies are made, they deserve to be... I rated this as a 10/10 movie only because the chart does not have any higher scores. Fair portrayal of the book; This is, in my view, the closes so far of the film adaptations of the Tom Clancy novels. I write this having recently read a precis of the new movie based on The Sum of all Fears in which terrorists try to cause a nuclear war between the USA and Russia. In the new movie, two bombs are released, one in chechnya and another in Baltimore.  The book was overall a very technical affair which admitedly would be difficult to translate to the screen. But enough of that, excepting a number of missing sub-plots from the book, clear and present danger follows closely the war against drugs and an illegal invasion by the USA into Columbia.  It misses off the wonderful helicopter finale of the book, but does a good job of capturing the audience. The car ambush is a particular high point that you'll want to see again and again! A good movie, but not as good as the original.; CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER It was good, but not as good as Patriot Games. The film went on for far too long. It was nearly 3 hours long and I felt it didn't need to be that long. The story has nothing to do with the original movie, which I liked. It was just the same characters in another situation. The original cast returned for this film which is always a good sign. I hate it when someone makes a sequel for a movie but changes the actors for one reason or another. It just makes it better when the original cast returns. Harrison Ford returns as Jack Ryan. He, as always, does a great job. I loved the new cast members to this movie too... Willem Dafoe played John. He was convincing in his role. But I think the actor I am growing to like more and more is Joaquim de Almeida. I have seen him in a few movies now and he has been brilliant in all of them. He really does play a brilliant bad guy. The action in this film is great. There are a lot of really good scenes where the action, explosions and suspense is great. This is another good 90s action film. It's one of those films that you have no idea who to trust... it is better not to trust anyone. I really did like this film, but it was on for too long and it was not as good as the original film. It would have been good if they made a few more of these with this character, just as long as Harrison returned as Jack. He could have been the new James Bond. I will give this film 6 out of 10. It is a shame there were no more.

Well, not as much as before, but, uh, still... nevermind; Special Collector's Edition review. I haven't read the novel. The first Ford attempt came off as more his movie than a properly done one based on a book by a solid writer. This gets closer to a healthy mix of the two. There is still action, and it's well-done, but it doesn't feel like it's struggling with the political thriller aspects for the spotlight(not only because of the considerably lesser amount). The pacing is pretty good, this is never boring. The plot is interesting, and I'd say the Clancy feel is a stronger presence in this than in its immediate predecessor(hey, you can go elsewhere for a straight Harrison flick, no?). The acting is relatively solid all the way. The characters are well-written and credible, for the most part. The editing and cinematography tend to be nice in this. The special effects leave little to be desired. The dialog has memorable lines, like the first in the series. The language does have some harsh words, but fewer(not to be confused with milder) than in the previous effort. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of the franchise, Tom Clancy and/or Harrison Ford. 7/10 Better than Patriot Games!; If you've read my comment on Patriot Games(you can by clicking my name above), you'll read I was a bit dissapointed in the film. The book by Tom Clancy was great, but I thought the movie was a bit slow at times, and boring. However, I still like Patriot Games. Clear and Present Danger on the other hand, I thought was even better. It's a bit more interesting, and although it also has some slow times in the film, some great action sequences make up for it. And as always in all Clancy books and films, the climax has great action sequences. Rent this movie if you haven't seen it. Watch it back to back with Patriot Games, and decide for yourself which you like better. 3.5/5 stars(.5 more than I gave Patriot Games, so I BARELY like this more, but just enough).-MovieCritic2003 The Old Potomac Two-Step; This was Harrison Ford's second outing as Jack Ryan following \"Patriot Games\" from two years earlier. (The character was also played by Alec Baldwin in \"The Hunt for Red October\" and Ben Affleck in \"The Sum of all Fears\", neither of which I have seen). The plot concerns a covert war being waged by American troops against drug traffickers in Colombia authorised by the President and his aides without the approval of Congress. Ryan, who has been promoted to Deputy Director of the CIA following the death of his mentor Admiral Greer, has to try and uncover the truth, which puts him into danger as the bad guys try to cover their tracks. \"Clear and Present Danger\" is in many ways a different film from \"Patriot Games\", and both have their strengths and weaknesses. \"Patriot Games\" was a more straightforward film. Although the villains were Irish terrorists there was no serious attempt to analyse, or make a statement about, the Northern Ireland situation; Irish terrorism was simply used as the basis for an exciting action thriller. \"Clear and Present Danger\" is a longer film than \"Patriot Games\"- at nearly two and a half hours it probably exceeds the optimum length for a thriller- and with more talk and less action, although there are some good action sequences. Those that stand out are the \"computer duel\" between Ryan and Ritter and the scenes where Ryan travels to Colombia to try and rescue the American soldiers who have been abandoned by the President in an attempt to try and prevent the truth coming out. It is a more political film about corruption in high places and the misuse of authority, reminiscent of Watergate and possibly also the Iran/Contra affair. There has been some debate on this board about whether President Bennett is a villain, although to me it seems quite clear that the film-makers intended to portray him as one. His decision to send troops into Colombia is motivated less by a desire to combat the international drugs trade than by a desire to avenge a personal friend who has been murdered on the orders of Ernesto Escobedo, a powerful drug lord from whom he had stolen money. (The surname Escobedo suggests that this character was based upon the real-life drug baron Pablo Escobar). He orders soldiers into action and then abandons them to their fate out of political expediency. There is also the question of the legality of his actions. The film takes the view that they are clearly illegal because they violate the War Powers Act 1973. The constitutionality of this Act, in fact, has been denied- not least by every President since its passage- but none of those Presidents have ever attempted to challenge it in the Supreme Court. Harrison Ford is once again very good as Ryan, perhaps even better than he was in \"Patriot Games\". Ford is not as versatile as some actors, but he does have his strengths, and playing solid, decent and reliable heroes is one of them, displayed not only in his Jack Ryan films but also in films like \"Witness\", \"The Fugitive\", \"K-19 The Widowmaker\" and the Indiana Jones series. Ryan's function in this film is not only as its action hero but also as its moral anchor. He is the man who can be relied upon to stand up for honour and decency, the man who, unlike officials from the President downwards, refuses to dance the \"Old Potomac Two-Step\" of concealment and corruption. (The phrase is taken from a key scene at the end of the film, when he refuses the President's blandishments to cover up the scandal). Political conspiracy thrillers have becomes something of a Hollywood cliché ever since Watergate, but this is one of the better ones.   \n",

       "      <td>Honoring the classics; It is indeed difficult to watch this film without hearing the Moussorgsky score in the back of one's head, even when familiar with the language and the original play. Pushkin's Shakespearian interpretation of Russian history was prohibited from the stage for nearly fifty years after the poet's death, and the Moscow stage director, Yuri Liubimov, had similar difficulties getting permission for his production around the same time as the making of this film. Bondarchuk's version has both the strengths of massive USSR state subsidy to ensure the historical accuracy of settings and costume, with the attendant weaknesses of a work that avoids any attempt at parallels with contemporary life. Bondarchuk's earlier film adaptation of Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\" successfully transferred a realist historical epic in novel form to its cinematic equivalent; adapting a verse drama with insertion of visual flashbacks and dream sequences attenuates the dramatic form without the dramatism of the human voice provided by the operatic version. I am not surprised that a subtitled version is hard to find: the effect of converting Pushkin's poetry to prose would further diminish the actors' mastery. Despite these caveats, the film is visually intriguing and well-acted -- an interesting footnote in the history of Soviet-Russian film. Reverential; The Russian videocassette for this film has a banner across the top, reading, \"Lityeraturnaya klassika na ekranye\", in other words, \"A Literary Classic on the Screen\". This is an adaptation, by the great Soviet director Sergei Bondarchuk, of Alexander Pushkin's classic historical drama, \"Boris Godunov\". Pushkin is considered the creator of Russian literature, and the film appears to take its responsibility to him seriously. Pushkin's is the only name to appear in the film before the title. I have never had an opportunity to see this film in a subtitled version, and I don't speak any Russian. That's less of a problem than it might appear, since Modest Mussorgsky adapted Pushkin's play for his \"Boris Godunov\", arguably the best-known Russian opera in the West. I can follow the film's plot through my familiarity with the operatic version (and with the opera's cinematic incarnation directed in 1955 by Vera Stroyeva). Here director Bondarchuk himself plays the title role, the Russian boyar who murdered the son and heir of Ivan the Terrible, the boy Dimitri, and usurped the throne for himself. But Czar Boris suffers from the knowledge of his deeds, and an ambitious young monk now claims to be the murdered child fully grown -- he's called the False Dimitri -- and has raised an army in Poland to attack Boris. The story takes place around the year 1600. (Modern histories still debate the actual events, some saying that the historical Boris may have been the victim of a later smear campaign.) Bondarchuk is an interesting choice to play Boris. He has a wonderfully craggy face and an appropriately regal bearing -- he is a film director after all -- so he looks right for the part. I consider his dramatic projection to be somewhat underdeveloped however. The Russian bass, Alexander Pirogov, singing the part in the 1955 film version, I found to be more anguished in his portrayal, and stronger generally. Bondarchuk seems to have wanted no reminders of that earlier film so none of Mussorgsky's music is used here at all, even incidentally. The composer he chose instead was Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov. Bondarchuk assembled an impressive crew in addition to his huge cast. Ovchinnikov and cinematographer Vadim Yusov worked on many of the great Andrei Tarkovsky films, right back to \"My Name Is Ivan\" in 1962. Visually, Bondarchuk uses his crew to offer up quite a feast. There are so many amazing exteriors and interiors of churches and palaces that sometimes you believe the director got his funding from Intourist, the Soviet tourist bureau. I can't name all the churches shown -- St. Basil's in Red Square is the really familiar one -- but they are all recognizable. I may know them from the earlier \"Boris\", or possibly from \"Prince Igor\", the 1970 film based on Alexander Borodin's opera also taken from Russian history. This film looks to have been expensive to produce, so needing four countries to back it comes as no surprise. The film's closing credits for some reason -- to indicate the international interest in the subject matter perhaps -- very carefully note the nationality of each non-Soviet participant in the cast and crew. Non-Soviet viewers will find a lot to appreciate in Bondarchuk's mise en scène. Massed battle scenes accompany the False Dimitri's invasion of Russia. The bleak snowy winter landscape, wind-swept and smoke-shrouded, makes one think that he's watching a cinematic version of \"War and Peace\". It's no coincidence that Bondarchuk is best known in the West for \"Voina i mir\", his epic film of Count Tolstoy's novel, widely available here only in its condensed 6-hour cut. Bondarchuk provides other striking sequences. There is the torture scene of Boris's victims being roasted on the wheel, shot silent, accompanied by music and effects only. A significant character in the story is the Simpleton, the troubled man who confronts the guilt-ridden Boris, and represents his conscience. Bondarchuk has him dressed in rags as he walks through the snow barefoot. As played by Ivan Lapikov, the Simpleton resembles Christ, with intense eyes of infinite sadness. Boris has a dream in which he sees Moscow engulfed by a conflagration, and then his own severed head, like John the Baptist's, lying on a salver. Colossal bells appear twice, seeming to symbolize Boris's power, precarious even at its height, shattering at its inevitable collapse. Overall, I found much to appreciate in Sergei Bondarchuk's treatment of the story. However his direction often seemed to lack the animation I would have anticipated. My involvement with the story was much lower than it was in the case of Stroyeva's 1955 version, which is the one I definitely prefer at present. Perhaps the absence of subtitles can account for this impression, perhaps not. I really do hope to have a chance someday to see a subtitled print of this film. There has been a CD release of Mussorgsky's \"Boris\", on the Arlecchino label, of an historical performance dating from 1948, I believe it is, with a line-up resembling that of the 1955 film, starring Pirogov as Boris, and conducted by Nikolai Golovanov. A final personal note: I was particularly interested in seeing myself in this film, that is to say, my namesake, Varlaam, the shabby loud-mouthed drunken monk character. Here he's played by Georgi Burkov and is very convincingly grotty-looking. In 1955, Krivchenya's nose was much bigger and redder than Burkov's, as I recall. I feel honoured to be portrayed by either man, so I'm declaring the result a tie.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The last good Disney film *sigh*; Man, why can't Disney make more films like \"The Black Cauldron\"? When Disney is doing PG-rated animated features these days, why do they have to throw in some \"gross-out\" humor, that would make the creators of \"The Garbage Pail Kids\" blush? Or why are they STILL trying to do some sickening sweet swill films ever since \"The Little Mermaid\"? I really love this film and here is why: 1. NO BROADWAY-ESQUE SONGS! 2. Dark, yet lovely animation. 3. The hero and heroine are actually IMPERFECT children, unlike most Disney films, where the heroes are usually \"perfect\" teenagers or adults. 4. Scary evil villains. The villains are not hammy or comical this time around, making a homage to the old films. 5. John Hurt does the voice of the evil demon king, enough said there! I just pray that Disney learns to make more films like this and less like \"Lilo and Stitch\" and \"Treasure Planet\". Really Boring.; Unlikely and ill-prepared young hero going on a quest? Check. Couple of sidekicks, one of them a magician of some kind, the other an animal of some kind? Check. Evildoer who lives in a dark castle and has found some physical object that has the power to control the world? Check. Lovely girl to play the damsel? Check. And what am I forgetting... Oh yeah. All of them live in a quasi-Medieval fantasy world and have weird names? Check! Yes, all the staple elements are here, happy endings all around, no surprises. And my GOD... This movie is SO boring I could barely get through it. This is the first and only Disney movie that is genuinely boring. The script is dull, the animation lacks any style or originality, the characters remain clichéd and undeveloped throughout, and the story is so plodding I was on the verge of fast forwarding... (And that's saying a lot, because I'm into animation in a big way.) Easily Disney's worst film, and it has nothing to do with the grave content- This could be pastel and singsong and it would still be totally awful- The script is totally devoid of anything meaningful or interesting. If you want a GOOD animated movie that is serious fantasy, get The Secret of NIMH. \"The Black Cauldron\"? Quite possibly the only Disney film that should have stayed in the Vault. My score: 3 out of 10. Not as bad as people say; I'm not a big fan of this movie but when I saw it, I didn't think it was too bad. It's definitely not a kid friendly movie, so it's not one I'll be buying for my future kids so they're probably going to miss this one too. But for what it is, it's passable. There have been far worse Disney films. But there have definitely been better ones. The main problem with the movie is that it's forgettable. I don't remember much about it at all. I can say that the villain is great!! He's actually very creepy. So if you love Disney villains, this movie's for you! Unfortunately, the characters, with the exception of Gurgi, who I actually thought was pretty cute and looked like a relative of Stitch's, are also quite forgettable. As a whole, I'd suggest watching it if you're a big Disney fan but don't expect it to blow you away. Great Tale wrecked up.....; A Dark version of Disney. They twisted a great work of LLoyd Alexanders and turned it into something even more evil than the books. Movie is actually a fuse of the Book of three and the black cauldron book....... One of the worst Disney box movies of all time. The Black Cauldron represented the Disney studio's attempt to reach out to teenage fans of fantasy novels, a popular genre at the time. However, the gamble proved unsuccessful as the film failed at the box-office. Some critics blamed the film's lack of appeal on the dark nature of the book (though some gave it a good review; Roger Ebert's review at the time of the film's release was mostly positive). (From Wikipedia) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Cauldron_(film)#Plot Excellent Movie; Recently, my sister and I have taken it upon ourselves to rewatch all of our 'classic' Disney movies. While I admit to enjoying a fluffy light princess movie, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. THE BLACK CAULDRON was quite dark, and obviously not meant for children. The first scene alone was enough to give anyone the creeps, and would probably scare a child out of their mind. The main character is, to put it gently, somewhat of a wimp. This is a nice diversion from the regular 'have no fear' royal prince that most Disney movies feature. It also had a princess who actually helped *do* something, unlike many Disney movies where the prince does all the work and the princess sits and looks pretty. The villain, however, is what made this a truly unique Disney film. He was scary. I honestly got very creeped out upon first seeing him. Unlike many villains from Disney movies, he had no humorous qualities, no stupidity. He was just creepy and evil. If I were a child, he would give me nightmares. Of course it had the typical humorous sidekick on both the villain side and good side (what Disney movie doesn't have one?) and the happy ending. I can't say that I have ever read the books, and I am sure that had I read them, I might have been somewhat disappointed in the film. But as it is, I found it very enjoyable, albeit somewhat scary. One of the main reasons why Disney is lacking.; When I was little I remember when they release the BLACK CAULDRON again on remaster video release I've been asking for it but I never got it and now that I went to get this movie I saw it and I understand why I never got it when it came out and I also understand why this movie did so poorly at the box office this movie wasn't good at all, at first I try to give a chance to like it but I just couldn't like it. The characters are not at all following like other Disney characters, with the whole pig boy who wants to become a hero who acts scared really and the princess I found most annoying with her flying ball and that old guy is the same way too. Disney can't think of anything new at all. Can't help but love....; This was the first new Disney film I saw as a kid. I was 6 when it was released and absolutely loved it. I still love it to this day. I wasn't at all scared by it so why it got a bashing for being considered too dark I'll never know. I love it because it is so different compared to the other movies Disney did at that time, and the animation is lovely. The characters are wonderful too. I had this obsession with the film when I was a kid, and bought the story book with clips from the film and everything (which is sadly lost now) so it had a real impact on me. I think that is partly the reason I love it so now. The nostalgia of the old Disney. Compare Cauldron to something like 'Home on the Range' and Cauldron really becomes a classic. They don't make 'em like that anymore. I think The Black Cauldron is a little gem. Nothing for Disney to be ashamed of. Well, At Least They Tried; In the 1970s, the Walt Disney Company was not doing so well. Considering both Walt and his brother Roy had passed on, the crew was left without much direction and were constantly asking themselves \"Oh, what would Walt do?\" in a desperate plead to let the films prosper. It doesn't help that the 9 old men were either dying or retiring, and a whole new group of animators had to fill in the positions. However, what happened when the new generation took on the task of creating their first feature film on their own? Years of development hell, animators pitching in ideas only to be discarded, and the original 92 min length getting reduced to 80. That film is the 1985 flop called The Black Cauldron, a film so infamous that Disney themselves don't even want to acknowledge it even exists, and good thing too, because this film really left a stain on Disney's legacy. The biggest problem this film suffers from is the story. Now it could be because the writers were trying to condense a couple of books from The Chronicles of Prydain series into one movie, but even as a movie on its own, the story is just disjointed. The goal seems to be to find the black cauldron, and yet the film keeps on switching from the main hero having to rescue his pig that has psychic powers (OK), to him being captured by the villain and having to escape, to then searching for the cauldron and ending up with fairies, and THEN when he and his group finally find the cauldron....the villain takes it, and then the heroes make it out and escape the king's demise....yeah, not a very exciting story if I do say myself. Also, the film constantly shifts in tone from dark menacing action scenes to cutesy fantasy junk with the creature Gurgi and a bunch of fairies....ugh. Also, this is the first animated Disney film with no songs, and while it does help move the story along, it just leaves me bored without much amusement. As for the characters, most of them are either bland, annoying, or both. The main protagonist Taran wants to be a warrior so much that he ends up being the most irritating to witness, and even the situations he ends up in are either accidental or just pure luck that he even got himself saved in the first place. Princess Eilonwy is OK but her backstory is never brought up, Fflweddur Fflam is basically the same, and Gurgi....well despite one heroic act in the end, he offers nothing to the table and is more annoying than charming. It doesn't help that the film barely if at all develops the characters, as there's never a moment where we get to hear them have a meaningful conversation or even monologue about their pasts. The only character worth praising is the villain the Horned king, and that's only because of how menacing he is, though at the same time he barely does anything, and he's easily defeated in the end.....what a chump. To the film's credit, the animation is very well done. It's dark and gritty, the character animation is pretty solid, the effects look superb, and the backgrounds drip with influence from European fantasy books. Not to mention, this was the first Disney film to use computer effects, and the sporadic usage of it really adds in to the occasional intense scene. The only problem with the animation is that while it is well crafted, it looks less like Disney and more like if Hanna Barbara got a big budget (if you know what I mean), and the cute characters of Gurgi and the fairies don't really contrast well with the gritty environments. Also, the music score by Elmer Bernstein is quite solid, as it fits every scene with grace, whether it be the menacing music attributed by the Horned King or the whimsical enchanted melodies attributed by the main characters and the fairies. So is this the worst animated Disney film? No, I'll still take this over Chicken Little any day. But even with its quality animation, brisk music score and menacing at best villain, this is an otherwise forgettable feature that lacks excitement, character development, and even solid storytelling. It's a really good thing the crew at Disney pushed up their game with the likes of The Great Mouse Detective, The Little Mermaid, Beauty &amp; the Beast, and more in the future, because as ambitious as this may have been, it overall left so much to be desired. Even more underrated than 'Oliver and Company' and darker but also weaker; I remember this film being publicised as a trailer on certain Disney video tapes when I was about 10 and I remember how much I wanted to see it because I thought it would make a great change from the likes of 'Pocahontas' and 'Hercules.' Like 'Oliver and Company' (which is better but not quite as underrated as this one despite my original claim of Oliver being the most overlooked Disney film from the 80s), I also thought that it was originally released in the 90s but due to its obscurity, it was in fact released in 1985 and it was a box office failure. Unfortunately I didn't get to see 'The Black Cauldron' until I was 20 when I rented the DVD from my now-defunct local Blockbuster and I really quite enjoyed it then. Today I watched this for the first time in nearly seven years on Amazon Prime Instant Video and sadly I found my second viewing more underwhelming than my first viewing. The film's weak points include its somewhat slow pacing, the similarities between Dallben and Fflewddur Flam, the frog jumping from the cleavage of one of the witches being a bit too adult for this film, the dragons looking similar to Maleficent from 'Sleeping Beauty' in dragon form, the darker scenes lacking in detail, Eilownwy's line \"Use the sword\" and Taran using it being similar to something out of a Star Wars film and, as the Nostalgia Critic said in his Disneycember review for this film, the more powerful/dramatic parts of Elmer Bernstein's score sounding similar to that from 'Ghostbusters,' which came out the year before this film did. As another reviewer has said, I also found the demise of the Horned King very dark albeit its impressive scanimation effects. On a more positive note, the strongest points of this film include its engaging if somewhat complicated story, the animation being smooth with effective lighting and cel-shading in parts in spite of its sketchy, linear look, the backgrounds being intricately detailed, some funny moments, parts of Bernstein's score sounding different from that in 'Ghostbusters' by making them sound medieval, more upbeat and majestic and most of the characters being diverse. Taran is talkative yet heroic, Eilonwy is one of Disney's most underrated princesses although helpful and gentle, the Horned King is sinister and reminds me of Skeletor from He-Man while Gurgi, Hen-Wen and the Fairfolk (small fairy-like creatures) are cute. I also found the small green goblin character comical and he made me consider him an early basis of Pain and Panic from 'Hercules.' Although I would like to have had the characters to speak in Welsh accents, their voice acting was full of clarity, especially from Grant Bardsley as Taran and Susan Sheridan (also the voice of Moomin in the 1990 2D-animated adaptation of Tove Jansson's books and Noddy from my childhood favourite stop-motion show 'Noddy's Adventures in Toyland') as Eilonwy. All in all, this may be the weakest feature-length Disney film I have reviewed to date here on IMDb but it was worth watching for its special effects, story and range of characters. 7.5/10. A dark and different Disney movie.; In the times of wizards and sorcery in a magical land called Prydain, there was a evil king called The Horned King ( voiced by John Hurt) who's spirit is captured in a powerful thing called \"The Black Cauldron\" which is a magical and evil cauldron that has been hidden for a thousand years knowing whoever possessed it can have the power to resurrect an army of undead warriors and rule the world. Taran ( voiced by Grant Bardsley)is an assistant pig-keeper who lives with his mentor Dallban ( voiced by Freddie Jones) with a magical pig who can create visions especially of the Horned King's desire for the mysterious Black Cauldron leads Taran to go on the adventure of a lifetime with new friends like a beautiful princess named Ellionwy ( voiced by Susan Sheridan), a lovable hairy critter named Gurgi ( Voiced by John Byner) and a broken down musician named Ffluder Flem ( voiced by Nigel Haththrone) as they search for the legendary Black Cauldron and must destroy it before the Horned King gets his hands on it. Considered the biggest flop in the history of Disney films, this movie was given a \"PG\" rating for dark content and themes and took 9 years in the making for a dark animated fantasy adventure flick. For me i thought this was a very entertaining and different kind of Disney movie that don't go into the musical routines but rather a straight Disney animated movie in the tradition of J.R.R. Tolkein. While it doesn't exactly follow the books well but it does have stunning animation, some early CGI for it's time and offers a lot of great fun for older viewers but not really for younger kids. Also recommended: \"The Dark Crystal\", \"Sleeping Beauty\", \" The Great Mouse Detective\", \" The Fox and The Hound\", \"The Last Unicorn\", \"The Secret of NIMH\", \"Fire &amp; Ice\", \" Bambi\", \"Rock &amp; Rule\", \"Heavy Metal\", \"Starchaser: Legend of Orin\", \" Oliver &amp; Company\", \" Pinocchio\", \" The Wizard of Oz\", \"Return to Oz\", \" The Princess Bride\", \"Willow\", \"Wizards\", \" The Lord of the Rings ( 1978)\", \"Harry Potter movies\", \"Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory\", \"Charlie and The Chocolate Factory\", \"Conan The Barbarian\", \" Mulan\", \"Aladdin\", \" Beauty and The Beast\", \" The Aristocats\", \" The Emperor's New Groove\", \" Atlantis The Lost Empire\", \" The Hunchback of Norte Dame\", \" The Lion King\", \" Lord of the Rings Trilogy\", \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\", \"Vampire Hunter D\", \"Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust\", Princess Mononoke\", \" Spirited Away\", \"Howl's Moving Castle\", \"Castle in the Sky\", \"Nausicca: Valley of the Wind\", \" Hercules\", \" Army of Darkness\", \" The Hobbit\", \"Return of the King\", \" Blade Master\", \" Conquest\", \" Legend\", \" Record of Lodoss Wars\", \" Excalibur\", \"King Arthur\", \" The Fifth Element\", \" The Iron Giant\", \"Transformers The Movie\" and \"The Prince of Egypt\". Great film, but not appropriate for kids.; I saw this film at 6 when it came out in the theatres. It scared the heck  out of me, but looking back, I realize that the quality of the animation is  what caused me to be so scared. Now that I'm older, and perhaps wiser, and  having read the books this movie is taken from, I realize how good this  movie really is. There is the standard Disney \"happy ending\" fare, but what surprised me is  the closeness that the movie kept to the story, which is amazing for a  Disney kiddie flick. The animation is almost anime and comporable to screen  shots of FF8. (FF8 is short for Final Fantasy 8, a playstaion game series  that is very popular.) Don't let kids younger than 7 or 8 watch it as it is very scary, but if you  liked the scenes in sleeping beauty where the knight fights the evil fairy  queen/dragon there is much to like about this film. I bought a copy the  first day it came out. Doesn't deserve to be dismissed as harshly as it has been; Always curious about The Black Cauldron, I finally got around to it after seeing a DVD at the rental store. Despite a lot of grating elements, I ended up liking it overall. The movie starts off on the wrong foot. The voices come across as recorded at low fidelity, and when combined with the sometimes hard-to-understand British accents, can be somewhat off-putting. Issues with voice and script become even more pronounced with characters such as Gurgi and his Gollum-esquire speech patterns. Indeed, the second time I watched the DVD I threw the English subtitles on, and not just for Gurgi. Other problems with voicing include an exceedingly dull lead actor for Taran (he simply can't emote), and an overly chirpy female lead for Eilonwy. Most other elements of the film proved passable if predictable in the Disney mold of plot, hero design, sidekicks, etc. Where it branches out for the better is in avoiding any and all musical interludes and along the way offering some scenarios and graphic effects that are more mature than most other Disney animated feature films (though later in the '90s the likes of The Lion King, Hunchback, and Tarzan would also tangle with mature themes). Animation is also spectacularly mixed in quality, an odd distinction among Disney films but a distinction nonetheless. Usually solid, there are high points such as external shots of a dark castle or a visceral chase sequence. There are also low points such as unnatural shifts in hair color that overemphasize different environments, or obvious spots where animation was rushed (a rock slide sequence). Yet for all these lows and highs, as an animation fan I ended up siding with the high points. Many sequences are inviting to re-watch, even if the entirety of the movie may not be. For all the talk of failure that continues to surround this movie, one can see in the film itself elements of a more mature Disney that could have been extremely promising with a more seasoned batch of animators and a world less hostile to PG animated fare. worth seeing, not for children at all.  Really fun.; \"The Black Cauldron\" certainly doesn't fall into the genre of animated Disney family favorite, but instead feels much like the more grim and complicated fantasy films that were made in the eighties. Does it stack up to such films as \"Return To Oz\" and \"The Dark Crystal\"? Well, although not as complex as the aformentioned, this film is not without its charm. The story of Taran, the pig-keeper's journey from gawky boy to gawky boy-hero apparently works better as told through the course of five books, and indeed it is the plot that feels put together, with a lot cut out of it for it's slim 1:20 running time.  Also suffering because of the short time is any character development, or a reason why the charcter of Dallben (an old minstrel) are in the film at all. However, this film still has a lot going for it. The film has a wonderful pacing to it with some fantastic action scenes. It is adventurous and fun. An engaing film for any fantasy fan. What really makes the film though is it's terrifying and dastardly villain, The Horned King. He is basically a Skeletor knock off with absolutely no sense of humor. He looks like he stepped right out of an Iron Maden album cover, and that is a monumental good thing. The true threat felt by the presence of this decidedly un-Disney character keeps the tension of the film high. It is this contrast, between the unconventionally ghoulish villans (definatly enspirered by Bakshi's animated adaptation of \"Lord of the Rings\") and the stock Disney characters makes the audience care more-so for the cutesy characters than usual. This is especially true for the cutsey character of Gurgi, who is much more tollerable than almost all other Disney sidekicks and especially more tollerable than a certain J*r J*r B*nks that we have all been over exposed to lately. So I would recommend \"The Black Cauldron\", it's a fun and well animated adventure film. Compleatly scary and strange for Disney to make, but still very very good for other reasons nonetheless. Worst Disney animated film ever!; What could be the reason this film scores so low for me. Well... Perhaps it's because it lost to the Care Bears movie in the box office. Or perhaps it scared off all the children for being too dark. Maybe it was the weak animation. I think it was lack of faith the film based its story from the book. I guess it was the waste of character development like Tarin, who makes Bubbles from the Powerpuff Girls look like Bruce Willis, or Gurgi, Jar Jar Binks'es more obnoxious grandpa, or a peasant girl who claims she is a princess but is missing all the elements Disney cashes in on Princesses. Probably the film could not make up its mined whether or not to take its self seriously with the undead of failed humor with frogs bouncing on fat wrinkly witch jubilees. It could even be the anti-climax with the lamest Disney villain flushed down the \"Black Toilet\". You know what,... its all the above! Buy as many DVDs and Blue Rays of this scourge and run them all over with a Leopard 2 tank after shooting them to bits. Coolest Disney cell-animated film ever.; Lately, Disney had seemed to take a bit of a plunge in its quality of its movies.  (I'm not too fond of movies like Lion King or Little Mermaid, well until the Toy Story series, but that's another story.)  I first heard of the Black Cauldron when my younger brother got this on a book and tape, and I found that I loved the story so much, I memorized the book and sometimes snagged it.  When I heard it was coming out on video, I got really excited. The Black Cauldron does have a deliciously \"dark\" theme to it, which makes it so much better than a normal Disney \"light and happy\" film, and the cast of characters is much better than usual.  I especially like the Horned King, with his weird, Grim-Weeper sort of look.  The story is of Taran, a young pigkeeper, who dreams of being Prydain's finest warrior.  His pig, Hen Wen, has an ability to create visions, which is probably where the trouble starts. The Horned King learns of Hen Wen's ability, and longs to use her to find the Black Cauldron.  The Black Cauldron is an evil weapon made when \"a wicked king so cruel and so evil that no prison could hold him, was thrown alive into a crucible of molten iron.\"  The Black Cauldron can enable any man the power to rule the world--or destroy it.  Go figure.  No wonder it's so sought after. I love the animation.  I espescially love most of the scenes that show the Horned King's castle.  They look so real, that you can't help believing it really exists.  (Well, you probably know better, but hey.)  And the scenes were the Horned King is working the Cauldron's magic is always worth a view.  I also like many of the lines, like the Horned King's sarcasm. (\"My, such a brave and handsome crew: a pigboy, a scullery maid, and a broken down minstrel.\")  One other bonus is none of those annoying, stupid songs that Disney has invented over the past ten years (With the exception of \"Nightmare Before Christmas,\" which had some pretty cool hits.) This movie is definately one of Disney's finest.  Disney needs to do more films like this.  I've heard that Tim Burton has helped animate this. I'm not really surprised.  The movie has a touch of that \"Nightmare\" air to it, from the gothic scenes to the characters, which are just a tiny bit twisted.  There is this one scene at the end where the Horned King actually looks a lot like Jack Skellington. (The Horned King is looking over a balcony, and for one brief second, you'll see the connection between the two characters.) I give this a perfect 10/10. Barely true to the book...; Even though the series of books that The Black Cauldron was based on, the Prydain series by Lloyd Alexander, is one of my favorite childrens series, I was disappointed with this movie.  The Black Caldron is the second book in the series, which has nothing to do with the Horned King, which is the villain in the first book, The Book of Three.  Also, Gurgi is not the one who ultimately destroys the cauldron, it is another character, Ellidyr. Also, he does die, for good, he isn't brought back to life by the three O's. In any case, if anyone is going to do a movie about those great adventure books, they should at least get the books straight, and do a series, as opposed to trying to cram the most interesting things into a disjointed jumble of animation, and leaving out such key figures as Coll and Gwydoin. Very Entertaining for Kids and Adults Alike; I saw \"The Black Cauldron\" when it first came out.  I was about six at the time, and ever since then, I had always wondered why I had never heard about it again.  I only had vague memories about it, but I remembered enjoying it. I had heard somewhere that Disney was so ashamed of the film that they had promised never to release it.  However, upon viewing it today, I have no idea what they were so ashamed of.  The movie is very entertaining in its own way; yes, it's very dark, and maybe not appropriate for young children, but I enjoyed it.  There is some excellent bits of animation in it, and it's a pleasure to see some vintage Disney before it started churning out the overblown, empty films it has made recently.  The movie is able to keep a quick pace so that you never get bored.  All in all, I would say that it is not one of Disney's best efforts, but it is certainly nothing to keep hidden away for 10+ years. Interesting, getting a bit scary there though!; For a Disney film, this is one of the first I've seen where the badguy isn't a comical human or something... it's an actual ghostly skull who we meet very quickly. The scenes with him start out very intense and scary (for a Disney movie mind you) and then start to get just more intense and more adventurous as the kids make their way through the castle and stuff. The idea of sacrifice is introduced and used in the movie. Not sure if that's the best thing to have considering that this is a Disney classic. However, the thing that gets sacrificed survives... but I found a flaw. I do believe the witches who made the trade said that only a HUMAN could sacrifice himself into it. While the thing which did wasn't human... yet it still stopped the curse in the end. -confused- But anyway, it was okay, and I have to give they some points for surprising me with the kiss near the end. Wasn't expecting it the way it was done. Anyway, I rate this 7/10. Should've stayed locked away in the vaults; I had forgotten about this film when I first heard Disney was \"finally\" releasing it on video for the first time.  Having become quite a fan of Disney's work over the past few years (never was much of a fan as a kid; go fig), I was anxious to see why they had never released this on video before. Now I know. This film, from the limited research I have done on the subject, apparently nearly sank the animation department at Disney, it did so badly at the box office.  It's no wonder. The shoddy storyline, unlikeable characters, and dated animation make it a wonder how it ever saw the light of day at all. The animation looked as if it could have just as easily been done in 1955 as 1985!  My 9-year-old niece was bored out of her mind.  So was I.  There was very little frightening about it that was actually supposed to be, and I have to agree with the quote I heard from someone that it was the first animated Disney feature to be \"completely without heart\". This movie is good for one thing, however:  if you're really interested, watch this, then watch The Little Mermaid (again, I'm sure), and marvel at the fact that those two movies were made only a couple of years apart (Little Mermaid was apparently already in the production pipeline when Black Cauldron was released; otherwise, we might never have seen it!).  Not only would I not recommend this movie for children, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone other than those into animation history, Disney history, or intense boredom.  Watch The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, even Hercules, before pulling this clunker off the shelf.  That Disney can't be sued for calling it a \"Masterpiece\" is a travesty in itself. A breath of fresh air from the cookie cutter; I must say that i am not a fan of disney movies.  They seem so cookie cutter-Fairy tale, good over evil, six r seven horrible songs from over paid composers, and wrap it up in less than nintey minutes.  This was their exception, a trying of new things, like walt set out to do in the first place.  The story is wonderful, the animation is out of this world, and the comic relief commits suicide in the end!!!! that's the best part!!!  The cuts fuzzy cuddly Gurgi Comits suicide to save his friends!!!! It's great!!! I must admit the hero at times reminded me of Davy jones from the Monkees but that's alright.   I'm a fan of Head also Judge it as a Film; I found this to be an excellent film! The voice acting was brilliant. The music was brilliant. The main characters (good and evil) were brilliant. The action was brilliant. Capable of making you feel emotion - happy, sad, baleful, hilarity, you name it. And I do love the fact that this is one of Disney's darkest. It's my favorite Disney film ever. And if you're gonna tell me \"Read the Books!\" don't bother. I tried the Books and they were horrible. Another overlooked cult classic.; The Black Cauldron is given a bad name by even Disney itself for nearly destroying their animation studio (it was a major flop at the box office, comparable to their films in the 1940s) and for being a departure from the typical Disney format of either musical or just light-hearted joy (for the most part), but the truth is, it only recently got the warm cult reception it deserved back in 1985. Despite having some dull moments, the acting is top notch (especially John Hurt's Horned King), the horror scares, and there is enough action (including a shockingly crude joke that left my mouth wide open) to enjoy it as much as Lloyd Alexander's series. In fact, on Rotten Tomatoes it has a higher rating than Robin Hood or a few of Disney's early-mid 2000s films (55%), which I guess can be agreed with seeing how many critics didn't appreciate the new format, though its execution is not something to be glossed over. See it for yourself; I enjoyed it, but I can't guarantee, especially if you like older Disney films, that your rating will be just as or more favorable. I wanted to like it.  I really did...; For years before I saw this film, I had been a fan of Lloyd Alexander's books.  To me, The Chronicles of Preydain rank alongside Tolkien's Middle Earth and Lewis' Narnia as one of the greatest fantasy worlds of all time.  Based deeply in Welsh legend and Mythology (many elements come directly from The Mabinogion, almost the bible of Welsh mythology) Preydain is easily one of the deepest, and most developed worlds out there.  So, needless to say, when I heard that Disney had a film in the pipeline, I got very excited.  Then I saw it... I can't say that I hated it.  More that I was disappointed.  This wasn't the Preydain I knew.  It was more a fairy tale kingdom than celtic Wales.  And what did they do with the characters?  Gurgi a cute fuzzy monster?  Elonwy turned into a typical damsel in distress?  And where were Coll, or Gwydon?  I'm sorry, but I didn't know these people.  The characters were all different?  And what about the rich sense of legend?  The books had been based deeply on mythology, but the movie took the first two books, sprinkled bits and pieces of them into a script, and added a ton of fairy tale and fantasy cliches. I've always wondered what it is with Disney writers that makes them feel it necessary to screw around with anything and everything (witness the amount of \"creative license\" taken with Pocahantas or Mulan.)  I'm sorry, but you don't have to have cute characters or happy endings on everything.  But Disney's writers think that you must.  And in this case, it cheapened the ending of the film.  One of the major plot points of The Black Cauldron is that the cauldron can only be destroyed by a living person sacrificing themselves by throwing themselves into it.  This was kept in the film.  Yet, when Disney did it, they still copped out to the happy ending by having the three Enchantresses, Ordu, Orwen, and Oregch bring him back to life...  Jeeze! It went on from there.  The absence of the true villan of the Preydain chronicles, Arawn, the lord of the dead, the turning of the fair folk (who in celtic mythology were more akin to elves and dwarves) into stock, albeit grouchy, faries....  The list goes on...  Disney ruined one of my favorite stories, and I can't ever forget that.  Even my love for Disney masterpieces like Beauty and the Beast or 101 Dalmations is tarnished by what they did to some of my favorite books of my youth... I liked it when I first saw it, but now I think it is only a sub-par film; \"The Black Cauldron\" is a film loosely based on a book series known as \"The Chronicles of Prydain\" by Lloyd Alexander about a boy who dreams of adventure, but when a magical pig named Hen Wen is captured, he has to set off on an adventure to find her and bring her back before the evil Horned King uses her to find the Black Cauldron, a weapon used to make dead soldiers come alive. I was about, I would have to say, maybe 8 years old when I first saw it. And I liked it a lot. It was a thrilling adventure. Now, I was not scared of it, but it does have moments that could be frightening to little kids. But that goes for a lot of Disney films. They all have an element of horror in them. It was not until 9th grade when I learned that it was a book, and it was not until I was in my teenage years that I started to read \"The Chronicles of Prydain.\" Now I think that the film version of \"The Black Cauldron\" is only sub-par. And here is why: This version is just the first two books, \"The Book of Three\" and \"The Black Cauldron\" rolled into one movie, with \"The Book of Three\" dominating the story of \"The Black Cauldron.\" In the film, Taran is an Assistant Pig-Keeper, but in the stories, he does not start out an Assistant Pig-Keeper. He starts off by making horseshoes. There is a character who is Taran's mentor named Dallben in the film version. But in the books, there are two characters, Dallben and Coll. What they did was have the characters of Dallben and Coll meshed as one. Dallben is an old enchanter. One might equate him to Gandalf or Merlin because of his wisdom and his appearance. Coll is the one with the bald crown. The Princess Eilonwy is an interesting character as well. In the books, she is a chatterbox. In the film, they cut the chatter down. But they keep her independent mind in the film, which is a good thing. Also, her bauble floats in the film. But it does not in the books, it only lights up at her command. The bard, Fflewddur Fflam, is not at all like he is in the books. In the film, they portray him as an old man, but in the books, he is quite young, and has spiky yellow hair. Gurgi is pretty much the same as he is in the books, except Taran meets him when Gurgi tries to strangle him. There are a ton of important characters left out of this film, and I was not pleased with that. One other part of the film that I did not care for was how they introduced the Fair Folk. They have them as fairies, but they are not like that at all. They are dwarfs, well, some of them are. Doli, the one who helps the companions to the place where the Black Cauldron resides, is not elderly. He is young as well. And the witches that live in the Marshes of Morva, Orddu, Orwen, and Orgoch, hardly match their descriptions in the stories. And the magic sword that Taran takes from the Horned King's castle, which is known as Dynrwyn, can only be handled by someone of noble worth, and Taran does not prove himself of that in \"The Book of Three,\" nor in \"The Black Cauldron,\" which only mentions Dyrnwyn once. The Horned King, now this was disappointing. In the film, they present him as an old emperor, but he is not like that at all. He is a warlord, and a young strong one at that. He does not speak at all in the stories, and he works for a higher power known as Arawn, Death-Lord of Annuvin, which they roll both Annuvin and Spiral Castle, the castle that the Horned King inhabits in the film, into one country. There is a character who works for the Horned King in the film called Creeper, which the makers of the cartoon created. Creeper does not exist in the books. There are tons of other changes made, but I will not list them, simply because although I do not care for \"The Black Cauldron,\" I do not want to spoil it for you. So, I say this to you because if you read the books, then you might be disappointed by the film. But if you have not read them, or if you have and you will appreciate it anyway, then feel free to see it. Is this Disney's worst animated feature?; I think not, but a strong case can be made.  SOMETHING sets it apart, and it's this: it's not so much a Disney feature as a Saturday morning cartoon, part of the same world as He Man and the Masters of the Universe, with more than a passing resemblance to other backlot fantasies of the 1980s - I refer not to minor masterpieces like `Ladyhawk' or expensive fiascos like `Willow', but to things with titles like `Syzgar: Sword of Destiny'. It's SO echt-80s fantasy that it almost works.  It's good to see Disney wandering over some new ground and bringing back the occasional luridly dark and lushly cheesy image.  In a fitful way they grabbed the unfamiliar genre and milked it for all it was worth. Unfortunately it's not worth very much.  You know the drill: a hero from out in the sticks sets out on arbitrary Dungeons-and-Dragons type quest to recover the magic whatever it may be in order to defeat one of Sauron's distant cousins.  The hero here is Taran, and the quest ...  Well, there's this cauldron that can turn corpses into loyal undead servants, and a villain called the Horn King who is after the cauldron, and a magical pig - Taran's pig - who alone can tell the Horned King where the cauldron is.  If the Horned King finds the cauldron he will take over the world and make everyone into an undead slave.  The solution, clearly, is to kill the pig.  But Taran doesn't: and moreover, he is willing at one point to let the Horned King know where the cauldron is in exchange for the pig's life.  This is surely carrying sentiment too far.  This is a deeply confused quest and it's usually unclear just what Taran hopes to achieve. Characters are weak: the Horned King is a kind of rococo Skeletor, about as menacing as the average action figure; his henchmen are the kind that shout, `Catch them, you fools'; Taran is as shallow is a rain puddle; and the characters he picks up along the way follow him about like flies, with as much reason.  (It's not all Disney's fault: the author of the books also had a tendency to substitute mannerism for character.)  And the dialogue is so baldly utilitarian it might have been better if the characters hadn't been allowed to speak at all.  I wonder why this is.  I'm sure if one scoured the five books one could have found at least 80 minutes' worth of decent speech, somewhere. All this is bad; but what makes it heartbreaking is the poor animation.  (It was a real shock reading the credits, because I recognised ALL the names.  Everyone involved has done much better work since.)  Many of the flaws are the kind you'd expect to see of a Saturday morning: Gurgi suddenly growing an extra coat of skin whenever someone grabs him by the neck; Taran and Eilonwy running as if they want NOT to get away, away from pursuers who are giving chase as if to avoid catching up; weighty rocks made of chalk and geese with wings of rubber.  I can't capture the low quality by citing instances.  The animation is just not up to scratch, and some characters - such as Taran, who is on screen virtually all the time - NEVER move convincingly. In short: a bad movie.  But I must admit I sort of enjoyed it, in a way I didn't enjoy, say, `Oliver and Company' (which IS Disney's worst animated feature).  I can't think of many objective grounds of recommendation.  One thing worth mentioning is Disney animation's only extended cleavage gag.  While it's not in the least erotic I'll bet the animator enjoyed himself. Still a piece of art in animation! To be seen despite bad critics!; I recently spot into the Black Cauldron again after having seen it for the first and last time in the mid 80's. Two things to say: First, this would have been a Don Bluth Studios production, nobody would have never shouted at it. The Black Cauldron do not follow the Disney philosophy at all and we almost all agree on that point. This movie is dark on its overall at a point that we can barely think it is targeting a very young audience. Dark movies were certainly a trend in the 80's, \"The Dark Crystal\" or \"Legend\" are very good examples of how this ambiance was present and used into the movie industry at that period of time. Second, the movie is not bad at all! Try to see it from a different perspective. Animation is just a piece of art and at first glance we can easily guess this is a Disney. Characters are nicely drawn, the princess is very cute, Taran is a teenager full of energy and willing to do well....the villain is freaking frightening, probably the most scary Disney villain of all times! But it is true something is weak in this movie : the plot and roles of some of the characters. What is the one of Helowny for example? Apart bringing the required cute female presence in the story what does she add? Giving advice or supporting Taran in his quest? More drama would have been created if she was the one to jump into the Cauldron! Taran and Helowny both feel attraction for each other...the movie is dark enough to let the cute princess die bringing the dramatization level a notch up (and bring her back to life for the happy ending). Just an idea but this makes more sense to me than Gurki sacrifice. There are also a lot of discontinuity in the animation reflecting production issues this movie ran into (team changes). I have the feeling sometimes that pieces of the storyboard have been stitched together without a proper transition. On the overall we feel something is missing in the story to be convincing but we can't judge it like a total garbage. This is a classic animation movie which used also new features for an outstanding result on the screen at that time! It is a controverted one for sure but still a classic to have in your Disney collection! Not awful, not great, and not what I expected; The problem with THE BLACK CAULDRON is not that it's dark. It's that it tries to do \"dark\" and doesn't do it well. THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME managed to be more dark and evocative than this. From what I can tell, CAULDRON wouldn't have been better with the edited-out stuff left in, either. Some of that material would have just contrasted much too jarringly with the movie's inescapable, if diluted, \"Disney-ness.\" (Having learned about some of said edited-out material, I'm amazed at the tone-deafness of the people responsible. They may have thought they were pushing the envelope, but even had this movie been better it was not the place for those kinds of attempts.) The best part of this movie is that it doesn't have any songs. But some choices regarding characters just don't make sense. What is the \"Horned King\" supposed to be? Wouldn't he have been better as a deranged, power-hungry human in a creepy costume (which, as I've recently learned, is exactly what he was in the source book) than as some kind of unexplained skeleton-being? Gurgi is not only annoying and difficult to understand, but he seems entirely out of place in the \"ancient\" setting. The minstrel guy serves NO plot function whatsoever -- I hate Disney characters like that, even if they're funny! The plot, whatever its faults (including the fact that there's no background or context provided for most of it), was reasonably involving. And I was pretty much OK with it until it got to the end, and Gurgi was miraculously brought back to life. Sorry, but that put the nail in the plot's coffin as far as I was concerned. Better than the reputation suggests; The Black Cauldron will never go down as a classic in Disney's history. It was a complete commercial failure upon first release and it's somewhat easy to understand why - no musical numbers (just an underscore), no fairy tale romance, steps on the dark side an awful lot etc. Negatives: The protagonist is very irritating, the voice work for Taran, Eilonwey and Gurgi is grating and distracting. There's a few animation inconsistencies and the story-line does feel a little scattered and unfocused at times. Examples of this is when they encounter the witches and the fairies. The jump scares are quite overwhelming too - it makes any viewer anxious of what's going to happen next. Positivies: The villain is seriously one of Disney's best. The Horned King is haunting, mesmerizing, powerful and terrifying all at once. He's very impressive and I would class him in my top 10 Disney villains. The animation, though inconsistent, is very beautifully drawn at times and detailed (the design of the castle). I also love the scene where the Horned King summons the dead and they march together. It's very haunting to watch but also chilling in a satisfying way. Yes, The Black Cauldron is certainly not for everyone. And it's definitely not geared towards children. But none the less I enjoy it and it's one which I will considering re-watching soon. Bad; Need to say, the only good thing about The Black Cauldron it's good quality of backgrounds animation, a quality that was not seen in the Disney studio since \"Sleeping Beauty\" (1959). But honestly, I don't care if this film has become \"cult\". Remains as bad as ever. First, Taran is the most forgetabble protagonist in Disney history. Unlike other friendly boys as Mowgli (1967) or Arthur (1963), Taran is boring and has no charisma. All other characters also suffer from the same problem. The villain looks like a character who was taken from some cheap episode of Scooby-Doo. Fairies / gnomes (or what the hell are those things) sound like dull rip-offs of the Seven Dwarfs. Gurgi was created to be friendly and for we to care with him, but he's just an animated version of Jar Jar Binks we wish to see dead. As if things were not already worse enough, the script of this film is problematic. In the beginning, we have a nut with \"magical\" powers (in my opinion the only sympathetic character in the movie), which seems to be the essential key to the climax of the film, but in half the movie to the end, she simply leaves to follow Taran and disappear in history. In my view, a serious flaw script. Add to the fact that history doesn't have any memorable moment, and we realized the disaster that The Black Cauldron is. Disney's best film ever; Please. Spare me the lecture about \"The Little Mermaid\" or \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\" Face it: they were dull! They had no redeeming value! Why is it that Disney's best titles-- \"Robin Hood\" (1973) and \"Cauldron\" are always overlooked? So, yes, the movie butchered Lloyd Alexander's series. So what? The world of books is completely different from the world of movies. If you can't take that, I'm truly sorry. Go read a book. \"The Black Cauldron\" is the fascinating, stunning tale of a brave but foolish boy, a precognitive pig, and an evil Horned King who will stop at nothing to become immortal. I always include this with my \"Best of '80s Fantasy\" marathons-- \"Ladyhawke,\" \"Willow,\" \"Krull,\" and so forth, with no \"Excalibur\" or \"The Neverending Story\"-- because it was such an amazing, imaginative movie that it deserves recognition as such. From the clever Witches of Morva scene to Gurgi's laments about munchings and crunchings, \"The Black Cauldron\" is why, after all these years, we still put up with Disney. Tolerable, but the books are better; The movie's okay, but as usual when Disney sets out to turn books into movies, something gets lost. rather than do the tale of one book out of the five (six, technically, counting the one of short stories), Disney attempts to cram two books into one movie, with a slight reference to the final book (the kiss). The characterization is off, plot points are missed, and what emerges is an okay movie, but is essentially trash for fans of the books. These fans, and I am one, must watch the movie without expectations, in order for it to be decent. It ain't half bad (ain't half good, neither); There were many good things going on in the Black Cauldron.  First, there  were NO SONGS, which really helped move things along.  Second, the villain  was truly frightening, the supporting cast was a lot of fun, and the movie's  breakneck pace held my interest and entertained me throughout.  But,  there were some bad things as well.  Taran wasn't really a character at  all.  Every important thing that happened to him was by luck or accident.   And at the end of the story he's right back where he started.  Also, the  plot was little more than a succession of action sequences, with little  sense holding it together.  The heroes simply fell out of one situation  into the next, perhaps the result of squeezing two full-length novels into  one movie.  And don't get me started on the ending.  Our hero stumbles  through the picture so that -- his furball sidekick can become the true  hero of the piece.  Yech.  Still, I was entertained, and I'd see  it again.   But for those looking for the REAL Black Cauldron, read \"The Chronicles of  Prydain\" by Lloyd Alexander.  You'll be glad you did. Like Having Your Childhood Raped; In 1985 I was a prime candidate for watching this movie: right age and having read the original books. Luckily I saw a promo before I got too excited and never did see it. Now I chose to watch the film for some reason, and I must say: Don't. The animation has not withstood the test of time and the story is very poorly written. That's not even mentioning the fact that I want to maim and kill every last bastard on the writing team for so completely ruining the best piece of children's literature in the world. Read the books. Shambolic film still worth seeing; \"The Black Cauldron\" provides us with \"Exhibit A\" of the disorganized nature of the Disney organization from the mid-1970s through the mid-80s. The company's feature films were attracting smaller and smaller audiences, and no real creative force had emerged since Walt Disney's death in 1966. By the mid- to late-70s, it was clear that new ideas needed to be tried. The phenomenal success of \"Star Wars\" appeared to offer a sure-fire way to box-office success: sci-fi/fantasy movies. At the same time, Disney Studio's full-length animated features continued their descent from the heights scaled in 1959's \"Sleeping Beauty\", at first downscaling the subject matter, then progressing to less and less impressive animation, and finally combining the first two trends with boring storytelling (see \"The Fox and the Hound\" - 1981). It was in this context that pre-production began on \"The Black Cauldron\" in the late 1970s. From an artistic standpoint, its goals were two-fold. First, the film was to recapture the lead in animation quality that Disney had traditionally held, while the second goal was to incorporate the advances in animation and subject matter made in the 1970s (i.e., playing \"catch up\"). Some early decisions were good: the source material was top-notch. Lloyd Alexander's \"Chronicles of Prydain\" are fantastic works of fantasy for the young adult - I loved them as a middle-schooler in the mid-80s, and the choice to film the story in 70mm widescreen harkened back to the glory days of \"Sleeping Beauty.\" Unfortunately, not much else worked. The studio's writers did a terrible job of condensing the first two books of Alexander's series, and we end up caring little for the characters that emerge, or for the plot as it unfolds. Also, the movie's tone is uneven. Overall, the work is very dark and un-Disney, which would've been fine had it been executed better. Further, the grimness of the plot doesn't mesh with occasionally clumsy and earthy attempts at humor, and the character animation fluctuates between sober naturalism and exaggerated, cartoonish mannerisms (stretching ears, gaping mouths, etc.) Still, some of the shots are stunning and rank among the best in the history of hand-drawn animation (e.g., multiplaned exterior shot of the Horned King's castle, beautiful backgrounds within the same, Hen-Wen's capture by the Horned King's creatures). The result of this mish-mash was a box-office flop ($25 million to make, $5 million in ticket sales upon its 1985 release). In short, see this film for its often-impressive animation and intermittent charm. Be sure to get the newly-available widescreen version on DVD. Bemoan the end of the era of stunning hand-drawn animation (Disney has closed up its shop; \"Home on the Range\" was its penultimate hand-drawn feature). Don't expect a classic, but appreciate the vision of its artistry - even if the final product didn't quite mesh satisfactorily. \"The Black Cauldron\" is a noble failure. Tragic spoiling of a classic tale (Includes spoiler); I must admit that I always feel those who praise this film haven't read the book. The story is told so much better there. The animation isn't up to Disney's usual standard, but far more importantly the entire story, including the noble and tragic ending, has been disneyfied, because we can't have people sacrificing their lives for their friends in a kiddie's movie. Oh no. It might upset people. They didn't want to tell the wonderful story which is there, and instead produced a drab, flat throwaway filler piece before their next big film. The only consolation is that there's no songs. Read the Chronicles of Prydain. Read Lloyd Alexander's 'The Black Cauldron'. Tell me I'm wrong. Not the best, not the worst; Plot in a nutshell: Taran is an assistant pig keeper for the old wizard Dallben in the land of Prydain who dreams of being a great heroic leader of men. Then trouble starts brewing when the Evil Horned King embarks on a dark quest to unleash the power of the Black Cauldron and attempts to kidnap Taran's pig Hen Wen, who happens to be an Oracular Pig. When Taran is given the task of taking the pig to safety, he loses her to the Horned King's forces and must embark on a quest to reclaim her, which introduces him to the hyper-talkative Princess Eilonwy, the slightly untruthful bard Flewder Flam, and the goofy little man-dog creature Gurgi, and then they in turn must embark on a quest to find the Black Cauldron itself and destroy it somehow. Well meaning if unsuccessful adaptation of the first two books in Lloyd Alexander's \"The Chronicles of Prydain\" book series, combining the plots of the first two books, #1 \"The Book of 3\" and #2 \"The Black Cauldron\", with the second book's plot taking center stage primarily. Many important characters from the books such as Prince Gwydion, Coll, Adaon, Morgant, and Elydir among others were lost in the translation from book to film. It's not un-entertaining, just uneven. Good animation and good music by Elmer Bernstein helps. Disney needs more films like this!; I am sick of the marketing.  I am sick of the lame musical numbers.  I am  sick of talking animals. I am QUITE sick of insulting cultural inaccuracies  (think Pocahontas and Mulan).   THE BLACK CAULDRON sticks out like a sore thumb in a crop of happy,  whimsical garbage that has come out of the Disney studios in the last  decade.  I remember when a Disney film had real plot, real art, real  characters, and this may have been the last of the bunch.  In the pre -Eisner era, Disney films had some credibility.  Its no wonder that it took  so long for this one to make it to video.  But I am rather pleased with it.   --The SurgeBot Something for the darker children of the world; I realise there are many who say that 'The Black Cauldron' is by far Disney's worst cartoon. I disagree. Although i have nothing per say against light princess stories or the animal fun Disney usually goes in for: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Fox and the Hound, The Jungle Book, Cinderella... etc. I say it's always nice to have a change, something for the less stereo typical, darker children to enjoy. I didn't know i was one of these children until i saw 'The black cauldron'. which quickly became my favourite Disney film. I'm sure I am not the only one who has watched many Disney films and not been fully satisfied, ending it and thinking 'yes but that wouldn't really happen would it' thought maybe it's a bit to happy. Thought that maybe we need a better villain. The first time i saw 'The Jungle Book' i was fine with Shear Carn but Ca the snake terrified me. You're never afraid of the people you're supposed to be afraid of in these films. In Lady and the Tramp you're supposed to be scared of the Rat and creatures like that but i was too busy being completely freaked by the cats. In Beauty and the Beast it wasn't Gaston i was afraid of or the beast but that machine her father had. In The Little Mermaid it wasn't Ursula but those 'unfortunate soul' things. In Snow White it wasn't the witch it was the trees. The same applied for all of these Disney films except the Black Cauldron. The villain is what makes this film. From the moment the film opens you see this terrifying black pot with this deep dark voice over which is then contrasted with the introduction of Taren, the central character and his pig, Hen. It turns out the horned king is searching for the black cauldron which will give him the power to raise an army from the dead and to find the black cauldron the king will come looking for Hen, a pig with strange divining powers so Taren (who dreams of adventure and the like) must take Hen to the cottage on the other side of the wood and keep her hidden there. On the way however Hen is stolen by some terrifying flying dragon monster things and Taren had to follow them to the horned kings castle and get hen back. The Horned King is as frightening as for once he should be and voiced by the immensely talented John Hurt. He is the most affective animated villain ever on screen and i say that with confidence. However to lighten the mood a little he is accompanied by a delightful but much abused little green goblin who is great fun as well as sweet and quite charming even if he is a little mischievous. Also along the way Taren comes across a sweet but strong minded princess, a highly dishonest but charming bard and the most irritating character ever put on screen. I can't remember his name but it's irritating. He is the one thing i am afraid the brings down the entire film in Disney's lame attempt to introduce comedy into the mix. The film closes with a dramatic and thrilling climax and does not disappoint. It was a welcome relief and change from every other Disney movie and a great success as far as i'm concerned. you might not like it but i always will. the Animation is poor and so is the script but the story and the characters shine though and will remain one of my favourite cartoons of all time whatever anyone else says about it. Dark and Violent. The Black Cauldron Was Unseccesful; *May Contain UnHarmful Spoilers* \"Hidden by darkness. Guarded by witches. Discovered by a boy. Stolen by a king. Whoever owns it will rule the world. Or destroy it.\" The Black Cauldron was a well-attempted film full of excellent potential. Unfortunately, this film was a bomb, and it was disappointing to watch. The movie took seven years to make, that's a long time, even for animation. I can see every dollar was put into every frame, and I can tell that they believed money was not a problem. Disney certainly had the money, but they surely didn't want to throw it all away. The success was very little, and it wasn't that it was horrible horribly, it was a little too dark and it just missed something. This was Disney's first animated PG movie, okay, it was violent, but not much more frightening than other Disney films in my opinion. The Great Mouse Detective was just as creepy and Beauty and the Beast was just a scary. But that's of little importance because they were much better films. The thing about The Black Cauldron is that it was shown to be dark and scary, but I think they could've have given the Horned King (John Hurt) a better portrayal evil. I enjoyed the characters, mostly. Disney has always had its little annoying side characters to bring the comic relief, but as far as Gurgi",
       " Taran (Grant Bardsley) is a young man who dreams of one day becoming a great warrior. All he has learned is to be the best pig keeper assistant, what a sad life. Taran lives his with uncle Dallben (Freddie Jones) at a little farm along with their precious piggy, named Hen Wen. Hen Wen is a special pig for he has powers to see the future. Ounce the Horned King of the dead discovers of Hen Wen's powers he immediately summons his soldiers from the underworld to capture the bacon. The Horned King desires the dark Black Cauldron that can conjure an army of infinite numbers. Taran gets to fulfill his life long dream, to be sent on a grand expedition full of danger and a promise to keep the pig away from evils hands. Daydreaming, Taran inevitable loses Hen Wen and is in fear of breaking his promise. He calls out for him, but instead of a pig he finds a, ummm, something named Gurgi (John Byner). Gurgi is a very annoying furry creature that plays the best friend act on Taran to get his juicy apple. He gets the apple, but loses his new best friend. Hen Wen was captured and brought to the dark whereabouts of the Horned King. Taran sneaks in to get his pig, but ends up captured and thrown into the dungeon. I would like to point out that the attitude of the Horned King was unrealistic. They call him the definition of evil and the master of sin, yet he shows signs of kindness of sparing Taran's life to be locked up instead, and will only strangle his little troll sidekick for failure. For a Disney film this is acceptable, but I just don't like exaggerating a character. Anyway, when Taran is locked up he meets a young princess, named Eilonwy (Susan Sheridan), who has been captured before him because it was thought that her strange floating ball of light could tell the future. Pointlessly to say, I like the young teenage relationship, while their hormones is blooming and discovering attractiveness to the opposite sex. So they both argue time to time, but they like each other overall. One thing I didn't understand was the significance of the magical sword of the long dead king that Taran finds. An ancient sword with magic to cut through metal, and it fights with a mind of its own. I would have thought that it would have more of a purpose to the plot other than it making Taran feel like a warrior, and a bargain trade for the cauldron. He really loved that sword, and felt invincible wielding it. I'll leave the story at that, and let you decide the rest. The Black Cauldron was impressive for its looks, but disappointing for most everything else. The only characters that I cared for were Taran and Eilonwy, and the Horned King was pretty cool. Everybody else was just annoying and pointless. I've pointed out Gurgi, and there's Fflewddur Fflam (Nigel Hawthorne), weird name I know, who tags along with his very expressionist harp. I could see the film going on without these two characters, though on the other hand without having Gurgi",
       " Though there is one thing that I find highly interesting, and that's all the sh*t this movie went through. Just count the dollars and the days this movie had in the process. It was expensive and it took several years to accomplish. However, the numbers were low for the movies prophet and it took more than a decade to come to video. Fascinating really, and despite this film being rated PG it went through some major editing. The new chairman of Disney, Jeffrey Katzenberg, had ordered the filmmakers to redo and edit the more intense and dark themes that would draw away a family audience. Here's the link if interested. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Cauldron_%28film%29 I really truly wanted to like this film, really. This film isn't horrible, and I would watch it again if I get the chance. Though I have to give this one the cold slip for a project failed. **/**** Stars The Black Cauldron (1985): Rated PG for some violent images Bizarrely patchy, very dark -yet captivating; The story of the black cauldron is essentially concerned with the very real threat of evil and this dark atmosphere makes for interesting viewing. Unlike most other Disney films this one offers few moments of light relief and thus begs the question is this a film suitable for children under five? However, its uncompromising, unsentimental darkness elevates it in my view above the more common fare usually dished out by those in the animation trade. The story itself is sometimes patchily told -too much has been compressed into too little time, and often it feels unfortunately cut. This aside the film is to be recommended, not least because it is so little known -compared to, for example, the incredibly rubbishy Lion King or the vomitous Pocahontas. A good yet forgettable movie; The Black Cauldron is about a young boy who must look after his magical pig. He loses it and must stop the black cauldron's evil.  Like my summary, this movie has many plot holes.  One of the more violent of the Disney movies, The Black Cauldron is a terrific yet forgettable movie.  It just can't stand against The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, which is sad because it is truly a work of art. I Love The 80's! One Of Disney's Most Unrecognized Classics.; i actually don't really love the eighties. don't hate it. but i'm pretty indifferent. it really wasn't much of a stand out decade aside from the possible notoriety of it's President. however, as far as Disney feature length, hand drawn animation goes, i have a real fond spot for the forgotten decade in their legacy. the eighties Disney films are very maligned and under-appreciated. and it's not very justified or fair. the eighties produced some of Disney's most memorable and endearing animated features. aside from 'The Little Mermaid', i've always thought the nineties animated features from Disney were somewhat over-rated. the nineties animated features always leave me a little cold and they feel over-blown and over-hyped and produced. the eighties animated films like 'Fox and the Hound', 'Great Mouse Dective', 'Oliver and Co.', had a sweeter, more endearing and modest quality that was lacking in the nineties. the nineties was cold. the eighties cartoon features are much cuter. 'The Black Cauldron' is definitely the best from the eighties. what it lacks as an adaptation of Lloyd Alexander's 'Prydain' books (i miss the Raven on Taran's shoulder), it makes up for as a excellent Disney cartoon feature. the animation and styling are unmistakably Disney. and as with all Disney adaptations it owes more to Disney than the source it's adapted from. that's the way it should be. Disney films should be recognizable as Disney. even though there is much waxing about 'Cauldron' being too scary and intense for little kids and how it has no heart, most of that isn't all that valid. 'Cauldron' is a very 'G' rated experience and not 'PG'. there is no sex or swearing or even any real violence. it's a 'G'. it's also a very cute and adorable film. Lloyd Alexander's books were a little darker and not cute at all. Disney has managed to Disneyfy and cutesyfy the stories, but it all still works. Johnn Byner's Gurgi is a art drawing exercise in cuddly cuteness. 'Cauldron' is one of Disney's most memorable of the later features. it boast startling hand drawn animation, handsome production design, and a wonderful film score by Elmer Bernstein. i know old school Disney. probably better than most. i spent most of my youth studying old school Disney and watching all the films. a lot of people can't always say that. i love 'The Black Cauldron' and think it's another one of those under-appreciated Disney gems. Waiting for a Classic, getting a Clunker; In 1975, I flew to Orlando Florida to visit Disney World. While shopping in the stores, I bought a book about Disney animation. Included in it was some rough concept art for THE BLACK CAULDRON. I remember hoping that the movie would be released, soon. Being 14 at the time, I thought of Disney movies as pretty much lame kiddie movies, but this looked pretty cool. Fast forward a decade, to me as a graduating senior from college. I remember hearing that the movie was in theaters, then POOF!, gone. Never to be heard of again, or so we thought. In the early 1990's a wife of a friend of mine was a manager at a local Disney Store, and I asked her when BLACK CAULDRON might be available on VHS. She rolled her eyes up in her head, and said, 'Pretty much, never!'. Apparently a lot of folks asked that same question, and she told me that BC, is the movie that Disney chooses to forget. Then, a few years later, we all went to one of the theme parks at Disney and were looking in a store that sold movie posters for their `great' movies. In the huge stack of `Little Mermaid' and `Aladdin' posters was one for BLACK CAULDRON. My friend's wife seemed amazed at finding it, and she said that `Disney must be considering re-releasing the movie if this poster is here'. And surprise, in 1998, we found it on the shelves of our local video store. My wife and I decided to preview it before we let our young daughters see it. And man, am I glad we did. Truly NOT a movie for the under 7 or so set. Dark, deep, and troubled, is the best way to describe BC. I do like more `mature' animation, but this seemed a mish mash of past Disney style, fantasy art, and a move in a new direction of animation. The other disappointing part of the 1998 release was, that it's in Full Screen format. What a let down as the movie is one of only two, I believe, 70 MM format animated Disney movies. SLEEPING BEAUTY, being the other, and that WAS available in VHS wide screen format. The print that was used to make the tape, also appeared to be very poor, and it appeared to have been edited, as one or two scene transitions didn't seem smooth. I may rent the DVD, and give it another try, but as previous posters have stated, it's not for everyone. And definitely NOT for the wee ones, who are best suited for `LITTLE MERMAID'.  Animation at its BEST!; I saw this movie when I was 6 or 7 years old.  Now, maybe others believe it is not for kids, and they are probably right.  But I saw it and never had nightmares.  I'm 19 years old now.  I didn't remember much about it except for adorable Gurgi!  My brother and I had a Gurgi doll and used to pretend he would go around stealing apples saying \"crunchies and munchies.\"  I didn 't even remember the Horned King.  I watched it this weekend and fell in love with the movie again.  I recommend it for adults and older children.  The parents will have to be the judge of whether or not their children are mature enough to handle the evil people.  But it is definitely a GREAT animated movie. Enchanting...; \"The Black Cauldron\" is an enchanting as well as an exciting story about courage, self-sacrifice and love. With beautiful animation, a superb voice cast, and riveting story, this movie will keep your eyes glued to the screen from start to finish. *MILD Spoilers* Set in a land called Prydain, young and adventure hungry Taran finds himself becoming involved in a plot to stop the wicked Horned King from finding the legendary Black Cauldron - a dangerous pot that can create an army of the undead. Teaming up with a lovely young princess, a bumbling bard, and a pesky critter named Gurgi, Taran quickly decides to take up the quest to save all of Prydain, and get to the Cauldron before the Horned King does... *Spoilers end here* I won't give it all away for you though. Get it and see it for yourself. It's definitely not a movie for little tykes, but if you have older kids or teens who like fantasy, they'll most likely enjoy it... and I'm sure anyone will, if they give it a chance. The weakest Disney movie is still pot-boiling stuff; This is definitely one of the weakest Disney movies, and it certainly didn't help that the Disney studios were on a low. It is worse than oliver and Company, which I liked. I liked this one too, but it is not for children. I haven't read the books, but even without reading them, you could tell the voice actors weren't given much to work with. The characters are likable but badly underdeveloped, especially Taran, who I thought was a little bland. There were some truly splendid animated sequences, but most of them were inside the castle, like the death of the Horned King(highlight of the film for me), as well as Morva, and the Fairy Kingdom. Creeper and Gurgi were a little annoying at first, but I definitely preferred Gurgi. The music by Elmer Bernstein was very dramatic, such a shame because the story didn't match that. However, on a positive note, the most impressive elements of the movie, were the scene of the cauldron destroying the Horned King, the wonderful sombre intonation of John Huston in the prologue and a sinister voice-over by John Hurt as the Horned King(who was really frightening). Speaking of John Hurt, I have an issue with Roger Ebert rating this film over The Elephant Man(Hurt's best film). In my opinion The elephant Man is much better than this, which is a 6.5/10 from me. Bethany Cox The film that Disney would like you to forget?; Version I saw: Amazon Instant Video stream Actors: 6/10 Plot/script: 5/10 Photography/visual style: 5/10 Music/score: 6/10 Overall: 6/10 The Black Cauldron has a reputation as the film about which Disney are faintly embarrassed, and would rather people didn't know about. The film has never had the publicity of others in the Disney stable, taking a long time to reach home video and DVD release. It would seem to have been a ruinously expensive box office flop, and investigations into the background reveal board-level personality clashes and fractious internal politics. I don't know about you, but that sounds intriguing to me. The film has problems, certainly. It is generally agreed to be considerably darker in tone than almost any other Disney film, and rather darker then studio execs were comfortable with. What first struck me, though, was not the tonal darkness but physical darkness. Throughout the early part, it was irritatingly difficult to even see what was happening on screen, even with brightness and contrast turned up to maximum. Thereafter, too, there is an odd discrepancy between the sumptuous, subtly shaded, almost canvas painting style backgrounds, and the simplistic design of the foreground characters, all thick lines and blocks of colour. There is a comparison to be drawn between The Black Cauldron and The Sword in the Stone. Apart from the medieavalish period setting, there is a distinct similarity in character design, and indeed the art style of the film in general. Thematically, though, it has far less in common with Disney in general than it does with Brian Froud's faerie illustrations and Lord of the Rings. In terms of the latter, some of the similarities are a bit too close to comfort. We have a Sauron-clone with Nazgul-clones, other incompetent lackeys (less unique, but still something in common) and a Gollum-clone. Admittedly, it could be that these were inserted by Disney based on Tolkien's popularity, and even if they are in Lloyd Alexander's source text, The Chronicles of Prydain, he would not be the first or the last to copy the seminal master of fantasy fiction. The writing has other problems. I found it short on the honed wit that brightens Disney pieces both before and since. Some bemoan the American committee style of writing, claiming that it leads to a certain soullessness, but at least a room full of brains can be counted on to deliver the zingers. Also, the main character Taran has very little about him to incline me to root for him. He is not strong, which is fairly standard, but neither is he clever, or brave, or even witty. His only real virtue seems to be luck, and even this abandons him at times in the narrative. This is especially a problem given how long he spends alone before companions are introduced. At least when other characters appear, they include a strong female character. Or do they? Certainly, Princess Eilonwy has personality, and a more engaging screen presence than Taran, but for the most part she seems content to tag along behind, and be a bit sassy. Still, that's a step up from Sleeping Beauty. So why 6 out of 10 and not lower? Two factors: Elmer Bernstein's excellent, strident orchestral score - exactly what one would expect from a cinematic legend of his pedigree - and the ending. I will try not to spoil it, but I found the deviation from the \"hero saves the day\" convention very refreshing. The virtues displayed in obtaining victory are not the sort to be usually found in this kind of film. That papered over a lot of cracks for me. In some ways, I was a little disappointed that it was not more repellent, or otherwise inappropriate, which would have been an entertainment in itself. I suppose that will have to wait until I can seek out and watch 'Song of the South'... A Worthy Effort, Though it Falls Short; Disney's \"The Black Cauldron\" is an uneven film, with an anticlimactic ending. The protagonist confronts the villain too early in the film to lend their conflict gravity. The villain's demise is ultimately unsatisfying and the film's resolution seems rushed. It is fair to say that the protagonist does go through a change in his view of the world, particularly what it means to be a hero, which lends the film merit. The tone mixes light-hearted Disney humor with the darker tones of the \"sword and sorcery\" genre popular in the 1980s. The film is ultimately interesting, in large part due to the animation and mature themes imbued in the plot. I loved that Disney, prior to the Eisner era, was willing to explore a dark sword and sorcery fantasy concept in its animation. This movie is no fairy tale, like \"Cinderella\" or \"Sleeping Beauty.\" I doubt Walt would have green lit such a grim project, which has more in common with \"Lord of the Rings\" than Dopey and Grumpy. A few reviewers have complained that \"The Black Cauldron\" does not look or feel like a typical Disney animated movie; that's why I enjoy it! The cartoon is based on a book for older children and preteens written in the 1960s, which in turn was inspired by Welsh mythology. The aura of high fantasy pervades the animation, which lends it an element of \"coolness\" that no doubt would appeal to older viewers than is the case for Disney animated films. The characters' facial appearances have the look typical of 1960s to mid-1980s Disney cartoon movies, so expect that. The Horned King and Creeper look pretty cool; while not particularly vile when compared to the likes of the Wicked Queen in \"Snow White\" or Stromboli in \"Pinocchio,\" the Horned King is one the scariest-looking Disney villains designed. His skull-face and antlered cloak evoke a sense of the sinister supernatural not present in much of the Disney fare. His army of undead soldiers, the \"Cauldron Born,\" are especially creepy--again, preteens who feel too old for cute mice and who want an introduction to high fantasy may be drawn by the ghoulish villains. This film also has a bit more realistic violence than most Disney cartoons, which may also attract older kids: the protagonist's cheek actually *bleeds* after a dragon attack, which is uncharacteristic for a Disney character! Granted, the plot and themes are pretty sloppy compared to Peter Jackson's \"Lord of the Ring\" films, but for any kid who wants a more \"mature\" fantasy-themed Disney movie may enjoy what \"The Black Cauldron\" has to offer. This film came out when high fantasy was en vogue, and films like \"The Dark Crystal,\" \"Conan the Barbarian\" and \"Willow\" were popular. Sadly, this movie was a flop, and marked a dead end for Disney's attempts to animate dark high fantasy cartoons for an older audience. I sometimes think of what could have been: Disney might have released a slew of animated features based on adult fantasy novels, like \"Wheel of Time\" or Herbert's \"Dune;\" hell, they may have ended up producing the first \"R\" rated Disney animated film, perhaps an adaptation of \"Game of Thrones.\" Sadly, this film's ill-fated production precluded that possibility, and it would not be until \"The Lion King\" and the Pixar movies that Disney would market its cartoons to children and adults simultaneously. While not a classic, \"The Black Cauldron\" is worth a watch. Watch it to experience a truly unique Disney venture: its first foray into high fantasy. Good, but bad parts too; This, I must say is one of Disney's better storylines. The thing is, though, it moves rather quickly. For the most part, I loved it; the villain was spooky and scary and fun characters filled in the story. However, the animation at parts was bad. Sometimes, it looked as though the characters were behind a blue screen because they animated the characters and sometimes used real video footage for the background. That can sometimes looks weird. However, I do highly recommend this to you, and I also recommend Lloyd Alexanders book series, from which this movie is based. I really wanted to like this, but it was pretty meh.; I was (and still am) a big fan of the books this movie is based on. Maybe that's part of the reason why I was kind of unimpressed by it. It had some good moments - the skeletal warriors were done up in a pretty cool manner, and the scene where Hen Wen is captured is rather well-done. I thought the voice acting was pretty good, for Dallben and Taran in particular. I think one major drawback of the film is that it tries to take a story that feels like a medieval legend and turn it into a typical fairytale. The animation of Doli and the Fair Folk is a prime example of this - they're turned into cute little fairies, almost like non- blue Smurfs with wings, complete with adorable child fairies - rather than the more classic kind of fair folk as being more like elves, dwarfs, or more naturalistic beings like dryads and the like. Gurgi got similar treatment. It kept Eilonwy's fiery temperament, but only at the beginning - by the end, she was just another damsel in distress relying on Taran (who, in the books, is kind of an idiot and always being told so) to pull them out of trouble. The scene in the Marshes of Morva was particularly disappointing, turning three very interesting and creepy characters into cartoonish, silly witches who somehow know of the heroes plans even though the heroes never spoke to them about it. The replacement of Arawn with the Horned King, who's done up like some kind of demonic living skeleton, is also disappointing - I guess just having a really evil guy was not good enough? They also left out major characters and plot points. Other drawbacks include sometimes-shoddy animation, and many overly drawn-out \"adventure\" scenes - chases around the evil castle, the wondrous but somehow boring discovery of magical fairy magicalness, the cauldron takes like 15 min or something to actually be destroyed, even them fleeing in a boat feels painfully slow. All in all, this movie has a few nice points and isn't super terrible, but it's also not particularly interesting. A bit disappointing; This was one of the few Disney flix I had yet to see. I read all 5 Lloyd  Alexander stories about Taryn, and I was a bit let-down by the movie  version. The plot was altered a lot, and some of the key elements that had  me riveted to the book were gone. The movie was a little intense for  younger viewers I felt, but the plot butchery aside, the movie can stand on  its own, albeit wobbly. I'd love to see more of the intense imagery shown  here (Hunchback of Notre Dame is my favorite Disney). Rent it? Yes Buy it? Ehh...rent it first. Not suitable for small children but REALLY COOL; I saw this movie well, the Dutch version in the cinema when I was 4, and ran out crying. Quite at the beginning as well... Now, 15 years later, I've seen it again, and I loved it. As I like fantasy, this film was right up my street. I later read the books by Lloyd Alexander, and Disney messed things up a little bit, but that's okay, they did the best they could. Problem is that it's not suitable for little children. Something you'd not expect from Disney. The Horned King is, with his appearance and his frightful dragons, maybe a bit too frightening for little children, and the plot takes a unexpected? maybe.. turn and that might not be good for little children to see, as that's really scary. Don't expect Disney-sing-a-longs, but a cool story and a real villain. If you like fantasy, you'll like this!  Under rated; I'm shocked by some of the ratings given to this movie. It is dark but so many of the great Disney classics are. I would have given this movie ten stars but it should of been longer to showcase the many amazing events that I cannot describe do to spoilers. If you like Ghibli I think you would enjoy this. I am writing this as I am watching the great mouse detective with my daughter. This movie Received a 9 star rating but is as dark as the black cauldron in my opinion. Although my 5 year old daughter disagrees. (But my 9 year old niece agrees.) I am writing as a father that has seen a lot of kids movies. Pretty to look at, but so, so boring to watch; The Black Cauldron is a far cry from most films of Disney's dark period (1961-1988) in terms of aesthetics. It is a beautiful film to look at with its dark fantasy world, appealing character designs, good score and lush backgrounds that remind me of the detailed backgrounds for Sleeping Beauty. And that is about all the good I can say about this film, which is a dreadfully boring narrative mess. The plot has little direction to begin with. There is no focus or clear goal to propel the story forward. None of the characters are interesting. Taran might be the weakest of Disney's animated leading men, having virtually no personality traits other than his cockiness and desire to be a great warrior. Love interest Princess Eilonwy is the same. Fflewddur is mildly entertaining comic relief, but aside from that he serves little purpose and could have been cut from the film with no consequence. Gurgi is to this film what Jar Jar Binks was to the Star Wars prequels. There are pathetic attempts at character development, but Taran and Gurgi's arcs are so weak that they leave little impact. The Horned King could have been an awesome villain, but he barely DOES anything, leaving most of his work to the ever annoying Creeper, who manages to liposuction all the coolness from the Horned King's scenes. I doubt I'll be watching this again anytime soon. It's looks are nice, but the story and characters are not emotionally resonant enough to make the whole product memorable. It's sad, because I love it when Disney delves into dark territory. Such a shame. Disney's failed attempt at changing direction; The 80s is known for its dark films. And even Disney films of the time are no exception. Their art style is muted, using heavy shadows, stark contrasts and swaying away from the cartoony colours. Their story lines are rather adult and depressing. Well, in comparison at least. And the crowning achievement of this is none other than The Black Cauldron, the most peculiar of the Disney canon films. At the time Disney Animation Studios were not doing so well. In fact the company was seriously considering closing them down and focusing solely on theme parks and merchandise. This movie was originally meant to change that course, but it almost ended up being the sole thing to ruin the whole studio. It wanted to take Disney to a whole different direction, picking as its source material a dark fantasy novel and staying very faithful to its tone, earning the PG rating. And yes, before you ask, the pig is in the book as well. Disney didn't add that to give the movie a mascot. Gurgi is in the book as well. I'm never reading that book, no matter how much you'd pay me. So what went wrong? Well, what didn't. The Black Cauldron is a mess. It was a major flop upon its release, and I can definitely see why. It has since garnered a cult following, but the fact still remains that it simply isn't a Disney film. Families went in expecting a typical Disney experience with fairytale stories, kid friendly messages and all around merriment. Instead they were treated to a medieval fantasy story leaning heavily towards dark and horror. But, that could be forgiven. I actually somewhat like the idea in principle. Great heroics, one scary villain, myths and legends, sword and sorcery, all done by one of the greatest animation studios on Earth. What's not to like? How about the fact that the main character is an unlikable, lazy jerk, the side characters have no, you know, character, the plot wanders around worse than a drunken minstrel, the end twist is unimaginably disappointing, the MacGuffin pig is ludicrous, the villain while certainly scary has no charisma or presence beyond looking like the devil and as a whole I'm simply not feeling the epicness. It's clear Disney had never done anything like this, and had no idea how to adapt to a different kind of storytelling tone. A dark fantasy story differs greatly from fairy tales, though they both certainly utilize the same character tropes and source materials. But whereas fairy tales are about morals and simple lessons about good and evil, dark fantasy is more about the struggle against eternal darkness, the meaning of hope in the midst of despair and about guts and glory. I don't get that from The Black Cauldron. The movie has its upsides, definitely. It looks great, the villain is certainly the scariest Disney has ever done and about one third of the story is actually pretty captivating. But it has flaws, many many flaws. Not my personal favourite, but you should still check it out to see if it speaks to you. An unconventional Disney animated film.; The Black Cauldron is a Disney film that is not based on a well-known fairytale nor is it an original Disney story. Instead, it is based on a novel by Lloyd Alexander, a story about pig-keeper Taran who attempts to find his future-foretelling pig so that the evil Horned King would not capture and use her to pinpoint the whereabouts of the Black Cauldron. The Horned King plans to use the Black Cauldron to spread untold evil and power. The film has splendid hand-drawn animation and a catchy music score. Also, the plot has steady pacing to it with some adventurous and exciting action scenes, and the villainous Horned King is also one of the more scarier-looking Disney villains out there. However, I thought much of the characters lacked any development or chemistry, particular that of Taran. He wants to experience more in his life than just settling as a pig-keeper, but his purpose and goals were not fully developed throughout the rest of the film. He also didn't have any chemistry with the heroine, Princess Eilonwy, whose purpose in the movie was also very vague. She along with the wide range of characters including the flying trolls didn't contribute much to the plot; it was as if they were just placed in the movie for window dressing. But again, there are quite a few actions scenes that made the film at least somewhat exciting, and the sacrificing elements, lack of comedy, and dramatic characters made this a pretty dark and un-conventional Disney film. It's not one of my favorites, but is watchable at least once or twice. Grade C+ sad to say i had to hate it; i thought it was a good move-if you've never read the book!!! Disney has gone over the edge with this. i had seen the movie when i was little, and thought it was a good movie. and it is if you've never read the book. just a little while ago i heard about the books and decided i would read them. i was blown away by the books! they were so good. personally , i'm a big lotr movie fan, i liked them more the the lotr books.the lotr books were just a little to detailed for me, so this came in first. the animation was good, but the story was heartbreaking. they start off with a bad start, this little fat lively bald guy, who at first sight i thought \"this must be coll\" which i thought they didn't do to bad. THEN I HEAR IT'S DALLBEN!!! i was mortified, dallben was supposed to be an old enchanter who hardly ever got out of his seat. and the way henwen gave the prophicies was all wrong. but anyway they continued the bad going by cutting out lord gwydion. what the heck? so then it turns out that the enchantress's, ordu,orwen and ogroch, already have the black cauldron. so then eilyonwi comes in and one is some little girl who doesn't talk near enough. and the whole thing with the sword, it just wasn't right. anyway in conclusion i could not stand it. the books deserve so much more credit than they get. read the books if you think this movie is good. An AWESOME! Disney Fantasy; I really disagree that this film is in the \"Top Worst 5\" list on Keyframe. I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews, because I thought this film was AWESOME! And also I have read the \"Chronicles of Prydain\" book series too from which this film is based on; well actually book #2. I love Princess Eilonwy, she is beautiful, cute as button and a brave young woman; her kiss with Taran at the end knocked me for a loop. (*sigh*) You know, I thought she and Taran do make a cute couple in my books. Also, I love Gurgi too. He is SO cute and talks funny too. So anyway, this film is an awesome Disney fantasy. It didn't work...; Of all Disney's failures, none are quite so infamous as The Black Cauldron. Based off material that was in the talks for decades, it was a property that was whispered about around the Disney studios for quite a few years before its conception (Ollie Johnston was an especially great fan of The Chonicles of Prydain). When Disney finally put the rights to use, they pumped oodles of cash into what they hoped would be the harbinger of a new age of Disney animation, one of darker, more mature storytelling. Not a single Nine Old Men put an ounce of work into this (okay...so Milt Kahl did some preliminary character designs...) and it seemed to be the consumation of the arrival of the new guard of Disney animators. What went wrong? Well the studio made the disastrous choice of handing off sections of the film to individual teams without giving them any interaction between each other, leading to some odd continuity and a total lack of a compelling throughline. Secondly, ambitions for a darker film were rather bipolar, leading to some odd inclusions like graphic gore and partial nudity and unfortunate omissions like a number of fascinating Tim Burton designs which were jettisoned for being too twisted. It doesn't help that the animation looks floaty and bland, some of the weakest in any Disney film up to then, and that heavy cuts under Michael Eisner removed said gore and nudity, only adding to the disconnected nature of this film. They made a few interesting choices, like reviving multi-planing (a very good idea) and using widescreen for the first time since Sleeping Beauty, but these don't make up for all the other blunders made by this film. The story is quite typical of Tolkien-inspired fantasy. An evil Sauron figure has returned to seek a magical item that will restore his power and send his armies across the land to conquer everything in existence. That item is a pig. I know, John Huston says he's seeking a cauldron, but he's actually trying to steal a magic pig from this film's Frodo Baggins, Taran, in order to find it. The one pig to rule them all. I'm not sure if that was in the book, and it's probably handled better in the book, but that's just a goofy sounding concept. Of course, our hero Taran, who's such a wimp that he's easily dispatched by the local goat (I know, that's what character development's for, right? right) loses the pig and has to go rescue him from the Horned King (who looks suspiciously like a demon from Night on Bald Mountain). Taran rescues the pig, but gets himself captured. With the help of a few fellow prisoners and a magic sword, he escapes, and it then becomes a quest to seek the Cauldron before the Horned King finds it. As animation, this is even more of a dark pit than The Fox and the Hound, which had a few real standout moments. There are no moments of excellence here, just floaty, weightless motion and an over-reliance on reaction shots that just looks awkward. Characters are thrown off-model in strange ways, and very little of the performances ring true. The backgrounds do have a nice atmosphere to them, but are also pretty smudgy. Design wise, very little stands out here, and I can't help but wish they'd incorporated things like Tim Burton's idea for flying hand monsters (not ripping off J.R. Tolkien enough?). The color design looks hollow and lacks any sort of warmth or emotion, as if drab colors were what was hip in the eighties (not that I blame them for thinking such). Lamentably, the best animation is Hendel Butoy and Andreas Deja's for Gurgie, a hapless character that they nevertheless lend some much needed life to. Otherwise, I can only point to The Secret of NIMH, made for less than half the money, and sigh at how the biggest animation studio in the world could have made a film that looked one-tenth as good. Not that Bluth hasn't made the mistake of failing to smell a bad concept, but even he must have gotten bad vibes from what Disney was about to do. One has to wonder how a studio with so much riding on this film could have gotten it so wrong. The failure very nearly drove Disney into folding its animation company, and so many potentially lucrative animators were driven into better careers elsewhere. It's a shame, but, thankfully, Disney did hold on to make a few more films. What's more, their very next project would be honest-to-god decent. It's a shame we didn't see a solid genre picture from this studio, though. We can only look at the disastrous final product and wonder what could have been. cutesy rewrite shocks readers of the book; harmless enough, but it lets the cat out of the bag: Hollywood scriptwriters only pretend to study literature on their way to the big bucks. Otherwise they'd have known the dollops of Disney cute that are larded over characters of ambiguous appeal could only choke the message. To Disney, the Ugly Duckling is a cuddly pet. An echo of some greater work is here, though, in the classical score. BLAH! And YUCK!; OY! Is this a stinker of a movie! I'm telling ya...I don't know how I missed  this movie in 1985 but I'm kind of glad I did! I had heard really great  things about it and was really looking forward to watching it. Well I  rented it... BLAH! It was a major disappointment! First I guess the Horn  King looks scary but then Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty was more so. And  I'm sorry but I felt no chemistry between the pig boy and the Princess.  I  have to say this is on of the few Disney movies where I think they totally  missed their mark. Off the Beaten Path for Disney; The Black Cauldron follows the quest of a young pigkeeper's apprentice to prevent the evil Horned King from unleashing the power of the black cauldron and effacing all life from the world. Surprisingly dark for a Disney movie, it offers more than the usual amount of frightening scenes, violence, and even some sexual innuendo (which is sure to pass over the head of young viewers). Luckily, it also features a cast of memorable characters -- the lovable, despicable, and comical -- that carry the magical Tolkien-esquire story through to the end. Imaginative animation, excellent voice work and a great orchestral score help to make The Black Cauldron a classic, albeit an under-appreciated one. Recommended, though it may be too scary for very young children. A Disney Departure; \"The Black Cauldron\" is not a typical Disney animated feature.  For one thing, it's not a G-rated musical.  In fact, it was the first-ever Disney feature to receive a PG rating.  The story comes from the works of Lloyd Alexander, in the spirit of J.R.R. Tolkien.  In it, Taran, a young pig-keeper must protect Henwen, a prophetic pig who can divine the whereabouts of a powerful weapon known as the Black Cauldron.  The demonic Horned King is after this bastion of black magic to create an invincible army of the undead.  This movie boasts impressive art shot in 70mm widescreen format, art which includes the contributions of a young Tim Burton.  Sadly, this feature did poorly in theaters, possibly being too frightening, or going over the heads of Disney's usual target audience.  Just the same, \"The Black Cauldron\" deserves a good look! The Fifth Element; This film fell under three of my \"to-view-or-review\" lists: Disney Phase II efforts, 80s fantasy, and 80s animation.  (Yes, I enjoy 80s culture.)  Fantasy films like this run on four theme elements: good, evil, design and differentiations.  The fifth element is trickier, the public reception to the constructed universe. Spoilers exist... The first and second run on stereotypes--the page warrior, the virginal princess, the Dark Lord.  The Villian design is from 'Heavy Metal'-style TV cartoons.  The witches are French stereotypes: how else do you explain the red hair, appetite for frogs, and power scheming?  The minstrel is the play-within element, the actor playing the actor.  Gurgi is the Jew/Russian stand-in. Disney's images come from past work--'Fantasia', 'Beauty', 'Dalmatians'.  Interestingly, Disney tries to make everything appear normal in our distinct Western configuration while Scott wanted 'Legend' to be hyperreal and hyperbole--just look at Darkness.  By comparison, the Horned King is Emperor Palpatine, plain. 'Conan' shifted our interpretation of the first element, 'Legend' mastered the third and 'Dragonslayer' emphasized the fourth (the most daring so far).  The biggest differentiations here come in lesser details.  The dragons, the skeletons, and the atmosphere we've seen before, but to lesser effect.  I noticed in 'Mulan' how Disney kept from showing war-dead, lest they spoil the happy mood they spent years perfecting.  According to IMDb trivia, Katzenberg censored this upon release, probably wrecking the more mature content.  He then decided to make his own version with 'Shrek' after defecting.  Meanwhile, Peter Jackson decided that since he has $300 million to blow, he wants everything.  So he turns elves and orcs into Aryans (either physically or philosophically) and all Gollum's mannerisms stem from Gurgi.  Some things don't change... Overall, this is not as complex as 'Wizards'.  Not as visual as 'Legend'.  Not as world-weary as 'Dragonslayer' (which had no comic relief).  We didn't want this foreign theme in our pop culture ideas--mostly sentimental--of what Disney movies are supposed to be (the same fate befell the 'Oz' sequel) so this has historical significance in charting Disney's retreat to Phase III formula. Bernstein copies his 'Ghostbusters' compilation for the score. Final Analysis = = Midrange Material Read the books instead; I don't even understand what the film-makers were *trying* to do with this. As an adaptation of Lloyd Alexander's excellent series, it's almost unrecognizable. When Taran draws a generic 'magic sword' in Spiral Castle, when Gurgi sacrifices himself to destroy the Black Cauldron, when the three witches perform a resurrection spell, when Eilonwy is reduced to weak love interest and Fflewddur to comic relief, it's clear that the writers have missed the point entirely. Nor is it worthwhile considered simply as a film in its own right; it's Disney at its most self-parodying, filled with tired shtick and cheap emotional manipulation. The animation and music are dull and only a couple of the voice actors provide bright spots. Avoid. Not for Kids; I watched this movie expecting a movie for children but a while in I had to notice that it is not at all suitable for children under the age of 6 or even 10. Other than Bambi for example the unsuitable content isn't limited to one scene but is pulled through half of the movie beginning with the body and ending with the movie. The beginning is cute and the characters are nice and funny but now and then you feel a bit freaked out by some situations. The tension is built up in the body and explodes in the final leaving young minds exposed to the spooky action terror drama set up at the end. If I had seen this movie at primary school age I'd be traumatized and I would have the permanent fear of losing someone. To put it in a nutshell for me it was a big mistake and I am desperately disappointed in Disney. Disney rewrite of \"The Lord of the Rings\"; So many striking similarities between Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and The Black Cauldron: A magical item, the black cauldron/the ring, granting excessive power. A wise wizard initiating an unexperienced lad. Cute companions to follow the lad. Flying black dragons vs. dark riders. A prophetic pig vs. a crystal ball. But as that, a twisted copy of something much larger, it was not very exciting nor does it have much depth, and it's not cute and funny either. My wife and I turned off after 20 minutes although we were looking forward to this Disney movie. Ten screenwriters = abomination; If you've read the books, this movie is a wretched butchering of Mr. Alexander's work.  If you haven't read the books, gently put this awful movie away and read the books instead.  They're by Lloyd Alexander and any library will have them.  Two of the five books received Newberry Awards (for excellence in children's literature) It is possible to change a book and still have a great movie - witness The Shining or The Lord of the Rings.  This film, with its TEN screenwriters, is a testament to just how awful an adaptation can be. Very disappointing; I watched this movie for the first time today, and was very disappointed. I had been told that it was notoriously scary for a Disney movie, and I can see how children would find it frightening. However, this was not the problem I had with it. I found it to be extremely boring. The plot and characters were both generic and underdeveloped, and I found little suspense, humour, or really anything positive about it. I can possibly see young boys being amused with the action and pure evil of the Horned King, but unlike most Disney movies, there is little appeal for older viewers looking for a decent story. I'm not going to say this is an absolutely horrible movie - it's not. But it is very bland, and very forgettable. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. May Be Disappointing For Some But Actually Pretty Good; I should state that I am a massive Prydain Chronicles fan. Naturally, when I heard there was a movie I of course had to check it out. After my dad finished reading me the books he rented the movie for me. My 7-year-old self knew that the movie wouldn't be exactly like the books due to time constraints and that it was only based on the first two books anyway, but the only similarity between this film and the books is the character's names. For one thing, there are tons of characters missing such as Coll and Gwydion, and the characters that do make it in are virtually unrecognizable. For example, Taran should have had black hair, both Eilonwy and Doli should have had red hair, and Fflewddur should have had blond hair. But these are all minor differences compared to some others. Dallben and Coll are also combined into one. If you read the books, Dallben is essentially Merlin in all but name while Coll is the pig keeper that Taran is apprenticed to. Also, the gwythaints are birds in the books but here are dragons for some reason. Lord Arawn isn't looking for the Black Cauldron but already has it. Gurgi is the same for the most part though I imagined him to be a bit taller. Also I found Creeper annoying, not like his powerfully imposing master. But how does it fare on its own? Well, there are definitely some good aspects. For one thing, the animation, while not the best I've seen, is very detailed, especially on the Horned King. Also, I like the fact that there are no songs. Nothing against musicals (there are some really good ones like Little Shop Of Horrors, Rocky Horror Picture Show, and Mary Poppins), but it feels like every other animated movie has musical numbers and quite frankly it gets kind of tiresome. But the best thing about the movie by far is the Horned King, who reminds me a bit of Cyvus Vail for some reason. While he may not be particularly action-oriented, he has a very imposing presence and a truly amazing voice (I must confess that until I went on IMDb I thought they just followed around some 90-year-old man with a mic). Conclusion: A surprisingly enjoyable and entertaining movie with a truly fascinating villain. Some fans of the books (which I am one of) might be disappointed but I found myself liking it. The Black Cauldron; I saw a short trailer for this cartoon from Walt Disney Pictures, and then I read the interesting trivia that Tim Burton worked as conceptual artist on this film before becoming a successful filmmaker, so I was definitely looking forward to watching it. Basically centuries ago in the land of Prydain, young man Taran (Grant Bardsley) one day dreams of becoming a great warrior, his enchanter master Dallben (Freddie Jones) tells him the secret of why he is assistant pig keeper, Hen Wen is an oracular pig, and holds the secret to the location of the Black Cauldron, which has the power to restore life to the dead, undead souls of course. The boy is forced to go on a journey to save Hen Wen when the pig is kidnapped by the evil skeletal lord The Horned King (John Hurt), who plans to use the power of the Black Cauldron to raise a large army of unstoppable undead slaves and soldiers to take over the world, and the fearsome lord has many minions to stop any intruders who try to get into the castle. Taran is joined in his quest by furry creature companion Gurgi (John Byner) who is small and pestering but reliable, comical middle-aged bard Fflewddur Fflam (Nigel Hawthorne) who tries to help with his poetry and harp playing occasionally, and of course the beautiful Princess Eilonwy (Susan Sheridan) who is his age and stubborn but has bravery. Taran finds a magical sword that helps him fight off the enemies, they encounter the small fairy-like beings called the Fair Folk who help them to locate where the Black Cauldron is, they find the cauldron in the clutches of three witches, Orddu (Eda Reiss Merin), Orgoch (Billie Hayes) and Orwen (Adele Malis-Morey) who will only trade it for the magical sword. They reveal before disappearing that the cauldron is indestructible, and the only way to break it's power it is if someone was to climb into it, but this will also kill whoever does it, none of the companions are willing to do this, so the young man feels hopeless and that the mission may have all been for nothing, and then the nasty soldiers interrupt. They seize the Black Cauldron and The Horned King uses it to raise his army who pour out into the world, the friends are released by Gurgi who jumps into the cauldron himself before Taran can do, the spell of the cauldron is broken and the army collapses, the cauldron goes out of control and eventually consumes and destroys the castle. In the end the three witches take back the now useless cauldron, Fflewddur convinces them to prove their abilities and allow a trade, the cauldron to revive Gurgi, they hand back the magical sword and Gurgi is alive and well, the young man, Eilonwy and the bard journey home together, and Dallben praises Taran as a hero. Also starring Arthur Malet as King Eidilleg, John Byner as Doli and John Huston as Narrator. The mostly British voice cast is well chosen, Bardsley as the young hero, Jones as an enchanter, Hawthorne as an eccentric entertainer, Hurt as a dark villain, Huston giving his narration, and especially Byner who sounds very similar to The Lord of the Ring's Sméagol but is really lovable. You could argue that this cartoon film is like any standard story full of swords and sorcery, and you can tell the animation is perhaps not the same high quality as previous and of course later pictures, but there is no denying that it is a really enjoyable tale for all ages, a fun animated adventure. Good! Forgettable Disney feature.; Disney studios seemed to endure a lull of about 15 years, beginning in the early '70s with Robin Hood and lasting right through until (and beyond) 1985. The Black Cauldron is nowhere near vintage Disney, but it's not without certain merits. For one thing, the animation is mighty impressive and marked the beginning of dazzling technological advances in Disney's animated features. Also, the voice-overs are excellent (with John Hurt a particular stand-out, bringing real menace to The Horned King). However, the problem here is that the decidedly uninspired storytelling severely lets down the film. The story follows a young pig keeper as he tries to protect a magical pig from the forces of darkness. The pig has the power to tell the future when its face is dipped in a pool of water, and an evil Horned King seeks the creature in order to use its magical skill to locate a long-lost black cauldron. If the black cauldron ever falls into the hands of the Horned King, then he will become all-powerful and rule the land. You don't have to know much about the fantasy genre to realise that this is a thinly disguised retread of The Lord of the Rings. For the black cauldron, read \"the one true ring\". For the Horned King, read \"Sauron, the dark lord\". Indeed, it's no exaggeration to suggest that this film is a sort of Lord of the Rings substitute for those with only 80 minutes to spare. While the film is just about enjoyable enough (especially for kids) it doesn't aspire to the high quality of previous Disney classics. It also might seem mildly entertaining whilst on, but it fades out of the memory all too quickly afterwards. See The Black Cauldron if you're a Disney completist, but if you're looking for real quality stick with some of the old classics, like Dumbo and Lady and the Tramp. fine Disney fantasy; In the land of Prydain, Taran is the young assistant to Dallben. He doesn't understand why the pig Hen Wen is pampered. The evil Horned King is searching for the Black Cauldron which can create an invincible army of undead warriors. Hen Wen turns out to be an oracular pig who can reveal the location of the Black Cauldron. Dallben sends Taran away to hide with Hen Wen but the Horned King captures the pig. Taran is joined by pesky creature Gurgi in his rescue mission. Only he is captured and thrown into the dungeons where he joins Princess Eilonwy. They escape with bumbling bard Fflewddur Fflam. This is an old fashion Disney fantasy adventure with a little bit of CGI. The characters aren't that charismatic. They are out of a standard script with a young man, a feisty princess, a bumbling old fool and an animal sidekick. The pig is the one that keeps me scratching my head. I appreciate something unusual but it strikes me as very wrong. The old bard isn't as funny as he needs to be. I like Gurgi but I don't necessarily love him. This is fine but it is inferior to other Disney animated movies. A boy must save his country from an evil villain.; Without any doubt the scariest of all Disney-features, this film has some remarkably obvious Disney-traits. Among them are the funny bad-guys and the disturbing comic-relief scenes. The script-writers have obviously had trouble squeezing Alexander's characters in. Hen Wen is initially the main character of the movie: however, the cute little pig disappears half-way. Gurgi's role changes, and Eilonwy's bauble vanishes. The film is also cut in two: there are two great climaxes, and they sadly stand apart with the disappearance of HenWen. It is a nasty blemish on an otherwise very entertaining classic: no vexatious singing, but wonderful exiting background music. The animation on the dragons and landscapes is stunning, the looks of personae are well-designed, the suspense in some of the scenes is intense. It is definitely a film I enjoyed after the first time. A must for fantasy-lovers. Interesting...if you want to see Disney at its nadir.; This film is about a pig who apparently can help predict the future! Yep, and such an important porker is entrusted to a teen filled with hubris--but not much actual talent. And, if they are not successful, Skeletor will rule the world!!! The word 'nadir' is seldom used, but it's quite appropriate for this Disney film. It means the absolute lowest point--and in 1985 the Disney released this poor cartoon to almost universal disdain. After reportedly spending over a decade on the film, the end result was very poor for a full-length Disney film. And today, most would probably agree that it was their worst movie. So why is it a bad movie? Well, the most obvious is the poor animation which varies tremendously but is generally no better than a Saturday morning cartoon from the time. Second, the choice of stories was bizarre. I think Disney thought their old films were passé and tried using edgier material--but the story is really shallow and the characters completely uninteresting. In particular, Gurgi is sort of like a combination of Jar-Jar and Golem. As for the rest, they are one-dimensional and not particularly likable. The end result is dreadfully too dull--way too violent and confusing for kids and too dull and poorly made for adults. I can see why HUGE changes resulted at Disney as a result of this poor film.</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Honoring the classics; It is indeed difficult to watch this film without hearing the Moussorgsky score in the back of one's head, even when familiar with the language and the original play. Pushkin's Shakespearian interpretation of Russian history was prohibited from the stage for nearly fifty years after the poet's death, and the Moscow stage director, Yuri Liubimov, had similar difficulties getting permission for his production around the same time as the making of this film. Bondarchuk's version has both the strengths of massive USSR state subsidy to ensure the historical accuracy of settings and costume, with the attendant weaknesses of a work that avoids any attempt at parallels with contemporary life. Bondarchuk's earlier film adaptation of Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\" successfully transferred a realist historical epic in novel form to its cinematic equivalent; adapting a verse drama with insertion of visual flashbacks and dream sequences attenuates the dramatic form without the dramatism of the human voice provided by the operatic version. I am not surprised that a subtitled version is hard to find: the effect of converting Pushkin's poetry to prose would further diminish the actors' mastery. Despite these caveats, the film is visually intriguing and well-acted -- an interesting footnote in the history of Soviet-Russian film. Reverential; The Russian videocassette for this film has a banner across the top, reading, \"Lityeraturnaya klassika na ekranye\", in other words, \"A Literary Classic on the Screen\". This is an adaptation, by the great Soviet director Sergei Bondarchuk, of Alexander Pushkin's classic historical drama, \"Boris Godunov\". Pushkin is considered the creator of Russian literature, and the film appears to take its responsibility to him seriously. Pushkin's is the only name to appear in the film before the title. I have never had an opportunity to see this film in a subtitled version, and I don't speak any Russian. That's less of a problem than it might appear, since Modest Mussorgsky adapted Pushkin's play for his \"Boris Godunov\", arguably the best-known Russian opera in the West. I can follow the film's plot through my familiarity with the operatic version (and with the opera's cinematic incarnation directed in 1955 by Vera Stroyeva). Here director Bondarchuk himself plays the title role, the Russian boyar who murdered the son and heir of Ivan the Terrible, the boy Dimitri, and usurped the throne for himself. But Czar Boris suffers from the knowledge of his deeds, and an ambitious young monk now claims to be the murdered child fully grown -- he's called the False Dimitri -- and has raised an army in Poland to attack Boris. The story takes place around the year 1600. (Modern histories still debate the actual events, some saying that the historical Boris may have been the victim of a later smear campaign.) Bondarchuk is an interesting choice to play Boris. He has a wonderfully craggy face and an appropriately regal bearing -- he is a film director after all -- so he looks right for the part. I consider his dramatic projection to be somewhat underdeveloped however. The Russian bass, Alexander Pirogov, singing the part in the 1955 film version, I found to be more anguished in his portrayal, and stronger generally. Bondarchuk seems to have wanted no reminders of that earlier film so none of Mussorgsky's music is used here at all, even incidentally. The composer he chose instead was Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov. Bondarchuk assembled an impressive crew in addition to his huge cast. Ovchinnikov and cinematographer Vadim Yusov worked on many of the great Andrei Tarkovsky films, right back to \"My Name Is Ivan\" in 1962. Visually, Bondarchuk uses his crew to offer up quite a feast. There are so many amazing exteriors and interiors of churches and palaces that sometimes you believe the director got his funding from Intourist, the Soviet tourist bureau. I can't name all the churches shown -- St. Basil's in Red Square is the really familiar one -- but they are all recognizable. I may know them from the earlier \"Boris\", or possibly from \"Prince Igor\", the 1970 film based on Alexander Borodin's opera also taken from Russian history. This film looks to have been expensive to produce, so needing four countries to back it comes as no surprise. The film's closing credits for some reason -- to indicate the international interest in the subject matter perhaps -- very carefully note the nationality of each non-Soviet participant in the cast and crew. Non-Soviet viewers will find a lot to appreciate in Bondarchuk's mise en scène. Massed battle scenes accompany the False Dimitri's invasion of Russia. The bleak snowy winter landscape, wind-swept and smoke-shrouded, makes one think that he's watching a cinematic version of \"War and Peace\". It's no coincidence that Bondarchuk is best known in the West for \"Voina i mir\", his epic film of Count Tolstoy's novel, widely available here only in its condensed 6-hour cut. Bondarchuk provides other striking sequences. There is the torture scene of Boris's victims being roasted on the wheel, shot silent, accompanied by music and effects only. A significant character in the story is the Simpleton, the troubled man who confronts the guilt-ridden Boris, and represents his conscience. Bondarchuk has him dressed in rags as he walks through the snow barefoot. As played by Ivan Lapikov, the Simpleton resembles Christ, with intense eyes of infinite sadness. Boris has a dream in which he sees Moscow engulfed by a conflagration, and then his own severed head, like John the Baptist's, lying on a salver. Colossal bells appear twice, seeming to symbolize Boris's power, precarious even at its height, shattering at its inevitable collapse. Overall, I found much to appreciate in Sergei Bondarchuk's treatment of the story. However his direction often seemed to lack the animation I would have anticipated. My involvement with the story was much lower than it was in the case of Stroyeva's 1955 version, which is the one I definitely prefer at present. Perhaps the absence of subtitles can account for this impression, perhaps not. I really do hope to have a chance someday to see a subtitled print of this film. There has been a CD release of Mussorgsky's \"Boris\", on the Arlecchino label, of an historical performance dating from 1948, I believe it is, with a line-up resembling that of the 1955 film, starring Pirogov as Boris, and conducted by Nikolai Golovanov. A final personal note: I was particularly interested in seeing myself in this film, that is to say, my namesake, Varlaam, the shabby loud-mouthed drunken monk character. Here he's played by Georgi Burkov and is very convincingly grotty-looking. In 1955, Krivchenya's nose was much bigger and redder than Burkov's, as I recall. I feel honoured to be portrayed by either man, so I'm declaring the result a tie.   \n",
       "459   The last good Disney film *sigh*; Man, why can't Disney make more films like \"The Black Cauldron\"? When Disney is doing PG-rated animated features these days, why do they have to throw in some \"gross-out\" humor, that would make the creators of \"The Garbage Pail Kids\" blush? Or why are they STILL trying to do some sickening sweet swill films ever since \"The Little Mermaid\"? I really love this film and here is why: 1. NO BROADWAY-ESQUE SONGS! 2. Dark, yet lovely animation. 3. The hero and heroine are actually IMPERFECT children, unlike most Disney films, where the heroes are usually \"perfect\" teenagers or adults. 4. Scary evil villains. The villains are not hammy or comical this time around, making a homage to the old films. 5. John Hurt does the voice of the evil demon king, enough said there! I just pray that Disney learns to make more films like this and less like \"Lilo and Stitch\" and \"Treasure Planet\". Really Boring.; Unlikely and ill-prepared young hero going on a quest? Check. Couple of sidekicks, one of them a magician of some kind, the other an animal of some kind? Check. Evildoer who lives in a dark castle and has found some physical object that has the power to control the world? Check. Lovely girl to play the damsel? Check. And what am I forgetting... Oh yeah. All of them live in a quasi-Medieval fantasy world and have weird names? Check! Yes, all the staple elements are here, happy endings all around, no surprises. And my GOD... This movie is SO boring I could barely get through it. This is the first and only Disney movie that is genuinely boring. The script is dull, the animation lacks any style or originality, the characters remain clichéd and undeveloped throughout, and the story is so plodding I was on the verge of fast forwarding... (And that's saying a lot, because I'm into animation in a big way.) Easily Disney's worst film, and it has nothing to do with the grave content- This could be pastel and singsong and it would still be totally awful- The script is totally devoid of anything meaningful or interesting. If you want a GOOD animated movie that is serious fantasy, get The Secret of NIMH. \"The Black Cauldron\"? Quite possibly the only Disney film that should have stayed in the Vault. My score: 3 out of 10. Not as bad as people say; I'm not a big fan of this movie but when I saw it, I didn't think it was too bad. It's definitely not a kid friendly movie, so it's not one I'll be buying for my future kids so they're probably going to miss this one too. But for what it is, it's passable. There have been far worse Disney films. But there have definitely been better ones. The main problem with the movie is that it's forgettable. I don't remember much about it at all. I can say that the villain is great!! He's actually very creepy. So if you love Disney villains, this movie's for you! Unfortunately, the characters, with the exception of Gurgi, who I actually thought was pretty cute and looked like a relative of Stitch's, are also quite forgettable. As a whole, I'd suggest watching it if you're a big Disney fan but don't expect it to blow you away. Great Tale wrecked up.....; A Dark version of Disney. They twisted a great work of LLoyd Alexanders and turned it into something even more evil than the books. Movie is actually a fuse of the Book of three and the black cauldron book....... One of the worst Disney box movies of all time. The Black Cauldron represented the Disney studio's attempt to reach out to teenage fans of fantasy novels, a popular genre at the time. However, the gamble proved unsuccessful as the film failed at the box-office. Some critics blamed the film's lack of appeal on the dark nature of the book (though some gave it a good review; Roger Ebert's review at the time of the film's release was mostly positive). (From Wikipedia) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Cauldron_(film)#Plot Excellent Movie; Recently, my sister and I have taken it upon ourselves to rewatch all of our 'classic' Disney movies. While I admit to enjoying a fluffy light princess movie, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. THE BLACK CAULDRON was quite dark, and obviously not meant for children. The first scene alone was enough to give anyone the creeps, and would probably scare a child out of their mind. The main character is, to put it gently, somewhat of a wimp. This is a nice diversion from the regular 'have no fear' royal prince that most Disney movies feature. It also had a princess who actually helped *do* something, unlike many Disney movies where the prince does all the work and the princess sits and looks pretty. The villain, however, is what made this a truly unique Disney film. He was scary. I honestly got very creeped out upon first seeing him. Unlike many villains from Disney movies, he had no humorous qualities, no stupidity. He was just creepy and evil. If I were a child, he would give me nightmares. Of course it had the typical humorous sidekick on both the villain side and good side (what Disney movie doesn't have one?) and the happy ending. I can't say that I have ever read the books, and I am sure that had I read them, I might have been somewhat disappointed in the film. But as it is, I found it very enjoyable, albeit somewhat scary. One of the main reasons why Disney is lacking.; When I was little I remember when they release the BLACK CAULDRON again on remaster video release I've been asking for it but I never got it and now that I went to get this movie I saw it and I understand why I never got it when it came out and I also understand why this movie did so poorly at the box office this movie wasn't good at all, at first I try to give a chance to like it but I just couldn't like it. The characters are not at all following like other Disney characters, with the whole pig boy who wants to become a hero who acts scared really and the princess I found most annoying with her flying ball and that old guy is the same way too. Disney can't think of anything new at all. Can't help but love....; This was the first new Disney film I saw as a kid. I was 6 when it was released and absolutely loved it. I still love it to this day. I wasn't at all scared by it so why it got a bashing for being considered too dark I'll never know. I love it because it is so different compared to the other movies Disney did at that time, and the animation is lovely. The characters are wonderful too. I had this obsession with the film when I was a kid, and bought the story book with clips from the film and everything (which is sadly lost now) so it had a real impact on me. I think that is partly the reason I love it so now. The nostalgia of the old Disney. Compare Cauldron to something like 'Home on the Range' and Cauldron really becomes a classic. They don't make 'em like that anymore. I think The Black Cauldron is a little gem. Nothing for Disney to be ashamed of. Well, At Least They Tried; In the 1970s, the Walt Disney Company was not doing so well. Considering both Walt and his brother Roy had passed on, the crew was left without much direction and were constantly asking themselves \"Oh, what would Walt do?\" in a desperate plead to let the films prosper. It doesn't help that the 9 old men were either dying or retiring, and a whole new group of animators had to fill in the positions. However, what happened when the new generation took on the task of creating their first feature film on their own? Years of development hell, animators pitching in ideas only to be discarded, and the original 92 min length getting reduced to 80. That film is the 1985 flop called The Black Cauldron, a film so infamous that Disney themselves don't even want to acknowledge it even exists, and good thing too, because this film really left a stain on Disney's legacy. The biggest problem this film suffers from is the story. Now it could be because the writers were trying to condense a couple of books from The Chronicles of Prydain series into one movie, but even as a movie on its own, the story is just disjointed. The goal seems to be to find the black cauldron, and yet the film keeps on switching from the main hero having to rescue his pig that has psychic powers (OK), to him being captured by the villain and having to escape, to then searching for the cauldron and ending up with fairies, and THEN when he and his group finally find the cauldron....the villain takes it, and then the heroes make it out and escape the king's demise....yeah, not a very exciting story if I do say myself. Also, the film constantly shifts in tone from dark menacing action scenes to cutesy fantasy junk with the creature Gurgi and a bunch of fairies....ugh. Also, this is the first animated Disney film with no songs, and while it does help move the story along, it just leaves me bored without much amusement. As for the characters, most of them are either bland, annoying, or both. The main protagonist Taran wants to be a warrior so much that he ends up being the most irritating to witness, and even the situations he ends up in are either accidental or just pure luck that he even got himself saved in the first place. Princess Eilonwy is OK but her backstory is never brought up, Fflweddur Fflam is basically the same, and Gurgi....well despite one heroic act in the end, he offers nothing to the table and is more annoying than charming. It doesn't help that the film barely if at all develops the characters, as there's never a moment where we get to hear them have a meaningful conversation or even monologue about their pasts. The only character worth praising is the villain the Horned king, and that's only because of how menacing he is, though at the same time he barely does anything, and he's easily defeated in the end.....what a chump. To the film's credit, the animation is very well done. It's dark and gritty, the character animation is pretty solid, the effects look superb, and the backgrounds drip with influence from European fantasy books. Not to mention, this was the first Disney film to use computer effects, and the sporadic usage of it really adds in to the occasional intense scene. The only problem with the animation is that while it is well crafted, it looks less like Disney and more like if Hanna Barbara got a big budget (if you know what I mean), and the cute characters of Gurgi and the fairies don't really contrast well with the gritty environments. Also, the music score by Elmer Bernstein is quite solid, as it fits every scene with grace, whether it be the menacing music attributed by the Horned King or the whimsical enchanted melodies attributed by the main characters and the fairies. So is this the worst animated Disney film? No, I'll still take this over Chicken Little any day. But even with its quality animation, brisk music score and menacing at best villain, this is an otherwise forgettable feature that lacks excitement, character development, and even solid storytelling. It's a really good thing the crew at Disney pushed up their game with the likes of The Great Mouse Detective, The Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast, and more in the future, because as ambitious as this may have been, it overall left so much to be desired. Even more underrated than 'Oliver and Company' and darker but also weaker; I remember this film being publicised as a trailer on certain Disney video tapes when I was about 10 and I remember how much I wanted to see it because I thought it would make a great change from the likes of 'Pocahontas' and 'Hercules.' Like 'Oliver and Company' (which is better but not quite as underrated as this one despite my original claim of Oliver being the most overlooked Disney film from the 80s), I also thought that it was originally released in the 90s but due to its obscurity, it was in fact released in 1985 and it was a box office failure. Unfortunately I didn't get to see 'The Black Cauldron' until I was 20 when I rented the DVD from my now-defunct local Blockbuster and I really quite enjoyed it then. Today I watched this for the first time in nearly seven years on Amazon Prime Instant Video and sadly I found my second viewing more underwhelming than my first viewing. The film's weak points include its somewhat slow pacing, the similarities between Dallben and Fflewddur Flam, the frog jumping from the cleavage of one of the witches being a bit too adult for this film, the dragons looking similar to Maleficent from 'Sleeping Beauty' in dragon form, the darker scenes lacking in detail, Eilownwy's line \"Use the sword\" and Taran using it being similar to something out of a Star Wars film and, as the Nostalgia Critic said in his Disneycember review for this film, the more powerful/dramatic parts of Elmer Bernstein's score sounding similar to that from 'Ghostbusters,' which came out the year before this film did. As another reviewer has said, I also found the demise of the Horned King very dark albeit its impressive scanimation effects. On a more positive note, the strongest points of this film include its engaging if somewhat complicated story, the animation being smooth with effective lighting and cel-shading in parts in spite of its sketchy, linear look, the backgrounds being intricately detailed, some funny moments, parts of Bernstein's score sounding different from that in 'Ghostbusters' by making them sound medieval, more upbeat and majestic and most of the characters being diverse. Taran is talkative yet heroic, Eilonwy is one of Disney's most underrated princesses although helpful and gentle, the Horned King is sinister and reminds me of Skeletor from He-Man while Gurgi, Hen-Wen and the Fairfolk (small fairy-like creatures) are cute. I also found the small green goblin character comical and he made me consider him an early basis of Pain and Panic from 'Hercules.' Although I would like to have had the characters to speak in Welsh accents, their voice acting was full of clarity, especially from Grant Bardsley as Taran and Susan Sheridan (also the voice of Moomin in the 1990 2D-animated adaptation of Tove Jansson's books and Noddy from my childhood favourite stop-motion show 'Noddy's Adventures in Toyland') as Eilonwy. All in all, this may be the weakest feature-length Disney film I have reviewed to date here on IMDb but it was worth watching for its special effects, story and range of characters. 7.5/10. A dark and different Disney movie.; In the times of wizards and sorcery in a magical land called Prydain, there was a evil king called The Horned King ( voiced by John Hurt) who's spirit is captured in a powerful thing called \"The Black Cauldron\" which is a magical and evil cauldron that has been hidden for a thousand years knowing whoever possessed it can have the power to resurrect an army of undead warriors and rule the world. Taran ( voiced by Grant Bardsley)is an assistant pig-keeper who lives with his mentor Dallban ( voiced by Freddie Jones) with a magical pig who can create visions especially of the Horned King's desire for the mysterious Black Cauldron leads Taran to go on the adventure of a lifetime with new friends like a beautiful princess named Ellionwy ( voiced by Susan Sheridan), a lovable hairy critter named Gurgi ( Voiced by John Byner) and a broken down musician named Ffluder Flem ( voiced by Nigel Haththrone) as they search for the legendary Black Cauldron and must destroy it before the Horned King gets his hands on it. Considered the biggest flop in the history of Disney films, this movie was given a \"PG\" rating for dark content and themes and took 9 years in the making for a dark animated fantasy adventure flick. For me i thought this was a very entertaining and different kind of Disney movie that don't go into the musical routines but rather a straight Disney animated movie in the tradition of J.R.R. Tolkein. While it doesn't exactly follow the books well but it does have stunning animation, some early CGI for it's time and offers a lot of great fun for older viewers but not really for younger kids. Also recommended: \"The Dark Crystal\", \"Sleeping Beauty\", \" The Great Mouse Detective\", \" The Fox and The Hound\", \"The Last Unicorn\", \"The Secret of NIMH\", \"Fire & Ice\", \" Bambi\", \"Rock & Rule\", \"Heavy Metal\", \"Starchaser: Legend of Orin\", \" Oliver & Company\", \" Pinocchio\", \" The Wizard of Oz\", \"Return to Oz\", \" The Princess Bride\", \"Willow\", \"Wizards\", \" The Lord of the Rings ( 1978)\", \"Harry Potter movies\", \"Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory\", \"Charlie and The Chocolate Factory\", \"Conan The Barbarian\", \" Mulan\", \"Aladdin\", \" Beauty and The Beast\", \" The Aristocats\", \" The Emperor's New Groove\", \" Atlantis The Lost Empire\", \" The Hunchback of Norte Dame\", \" The Lion King\", \" Lord of the Rings Trilogy\", \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\", \"Vampire Hunter D\", \"Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust\", Princess Mononoke\", \" Spirited Away\", \"Howl's Moving Castle\", \"Castle in the Sky\", \"Nausicca: Valley of the Wind\", \" Hercules\", \" Army of Darkness\", \" The Hobbit\", \"Return of the King\", \" Blade Master\", \" Conquest\", \" Legend\", \" Record of Lodoss Wars\", \" Excalibur\", \"King Arthur\", \" The Fifth Element\", \" The Iron Giant\", \"Transformers The Movie\" and \"The Prince of Egypt\". Great film, but not appropriate for kids.; I saw this film at 6 when it came out in the theatres. It scared the heck  out of me, but looking back, I realize that the quality of the animation is  what caused me to be so scared. Now that I'm older, and perhaps wiser, and  having read the books this movie is taken from, I realize how good this  movie really is. There is the standard Disney \"happy ending\" fare, but what surprised me is  the closeness that the movie kept to the story, which is amazing for a  Disney kiddie flick. The animation is almost anime and comporable to screen  shots of FF8. (FF8 is short for Final Fantasy 8, a playstaion game series  that is very popular.) Don't let kids younger than 7 or 8 watch it as it is very scary, but if you  liked the scenes in sleeping beauty where the knight fights the evil fairy  queen/dragon there is much to like about this film. I bought a copy the  first day it came out. Doesn't deserve to be dismissed as harshly as it has been; Always curious about The Black Cauldron, I finally got around to it after seeing a DVD at the rental store. Despite a lot of grating elements, I ended up liking it overall. The movie starts off on the wrong foot. The voices come across as recorded at low fidelity, and when combined with the sometimes hard-to-understand British accents, can be somewhat off-putting. Issues with voice and script become even more pronounced with characters such as Gurgi and his Gollum-esquire speech patterns. Indeed, the second time I watched the DVD I threw the English subtitles on, and not just for Gurgi. Other problems with voicing include an exceedingly dull lead actor for Taran (he simply can't emote), and an overly chirpy female lead for Eilonwy. Most other elements of the film proved passable if predictable in the Disney mold of plot, hero design, sidekicks, etc. Where it branches out for the better is in avoiding any and all musical interludes and along the way offering some scenarios and graphic effects that are more mature than most other Disney animated feature films (though later in the '90s the likes of The Lion King, Hunchback, and Tarzan would also tangle with mature themes). Animation is also spectacularly mixed in quality, an odd distinction among Disney films but a distinction nonetheless. Usually solid, there are high points such as external shots of a dark castle or a visceral chase sequence. There are also low points such as unnatural shifts in hair color that overemphasize different environments, or obvious spots where animation was rushed (a rock slide sequence). Yet for all these lows and highs, as an animation fan I ended up siding with the high points. Many sequences are inviting to re-watch, even if the entirety of the movie may not be. For all the talk of failure that continues to surround this movie, one can see in the film itself elements of a more mature Disney that could have been extremely promising with a more seasoned batch of animators and a world less hostile to PG animated fare. worth seeing, not for children at all.  Really fun.; \"The Black Cauldron\" certainly doesn't fall into the genre of animated Disney family favorite, but instead feels much like the more grim and complicated fantasy films that were made in the eighties. Does it stack up to such films as \"Return To Oz\" and \"The Dark Crystal\"? Well, although not as complex as the aformentioned, this film is not without its charm. The story of Taran, the pig-keeper's journey from gawky boy to gawky boy-hero apparently works better as told through the course of five books, and indeed it is the plot that feels put together, with a lot cut out of it for it's slim 1:20 running time.  Also suffering because of the short time is any character development, or a reason why the charcter of Dallben (an old minstrel) are in the film at all. However, this film still has a lot going for it. The film has a wonderful pacing to it with some fantastic action scenes. It is adventurous and fun. An engaing film for any fantasy fan. What really makes the film though is it's terrifying and dastardly villain, The Horned King. He is basically a Skeletor knock off with absolutely no sense of humor. He looks like he stepped right out of an Iron Maden album cover, and that is a monumental good thing. The true threat felt by the presence of this decidedly un-Disney character keeps the tension of the film high. It is this contrast, between the unconventionally ghoulish villans (definatly enspirered by Bakshi's animated adaptation of \"Lord of the Rings\") and the stock Disney characters makes the audience care more-so for the cutesy characters than usual. This is especially true for the cutsey character of Gurgi, who is much more tollerable than almost all other Disney sidekicks and especially more tollerable than a certain J*r J*r B*nks that we have all been over exposed to lately. So I would recommend \"The Black Cauldron\", it's a fun and well animated adventure film. Compleatly scary and strange for Disney to make, but still very very good for other reasons nonetheless. Worst Disney animated film ever!; What could be the reason this film scores so low for me. Well... Perhaps it's because it lost to the Care Bears movie in the box office. Or perhaps it scared off all the children for being too dark. Maybe it was the weak animation. I think it was lack of faith the film based its story from the book. I guess it was the waste of character development like Tarin, who makes Bubbles from the Powerpuff Girls look like Bruce Willis, or Gurgi, Jar Jar Binks'es more obnoxious grandpa, or a peasant girl who claims she is a princess but is missing all the elements Disney cashes in on Princesses. Probably the film could not make up its mined whether or not to take its self seriously with the undead of failed humor with frogs bouncing on fat wrinkly witch jubilees. It could even be the anti-climax with the lamest Disney villain flushed down the \"Black Toilet\". You know what,... its all the above! Buy as many DVDs and Blue Rays of this scourge and run them all over with a Leopard 2 tank after shooting them to bits. Coolest Disney cell-animated film ever.; Lately, Disney had seemed to take a bit of a plunge in its quality of its movies.  (I'm not too fond of movies like Lion King or Little Mermaid, well until the Toy Story series, but that's another story.)  I first heard of the Black Cauldron when my younger brother got this on a book and tape, and I found that I loved the story so much, I memorized the book and sometimes snagged it.  When I heard it was coming out on video, I got really excited. The Black Cauldron does have a deliciously \"dark\" theme to it, which makes it so much better than a normal Disney \"light and happy\" film, and the cast of characters is much better than usual.  I especially like the Horned King, with his weird, Grim-Weeper sort of look.  The story is of Taran, a young pigkeeper, who dreams of being Prydain's finest warrior.  His pig, Hen Wen, has an ability to create visions, which is probably where the trouble starts. The Horned King learns of Hen Wen's ability, and longs to use her to find the Black Cauldron.  The Black Cauldron is an evil weapon made when \"a wicked king so cruel and so evil that no prison could hold him, was thrown alive into a crucible of molten iron.\"  The Black Cauldron can enable any man the power to rule the world--or destroy it.  Go figure.  No wonder it's so sought after. I love the animation.  I espescially love most of the scenes that show the Horned King's castle.  They look so real, that you can't help believing it really exists.  (Well, you probably know better, but hey.)  And the scenes were the Horned King is working the Cauldron's magic is always worth a view.  I also like many of the lines, like the Horned King's sarcasm. (\"My, such a brave and handsome crew: a pigboy, a scullery maid, and a broken down minstrel.\")  One other bonus is none of those annoying, stupid songs that Disney has invented over the past ten years (With the exception of \"Nightmare Before Christmas,\" which had some pretty cool hits.) This movie is definately one of Disney's finest.  Disney needs to do more films like this.  I've heard that Tim Burton has helped animate this. I'm not really surprised.  The movie has a touch of that \"Nightmare\" air to it, from the gothic scenes to the characters, which are just a tiny bit twisted.  There is this one scene at the end where the Horned King actually looks a lot like Jack Skellington. (The Horned King is looking over a balcony, and for one brief second, you'll see the connection between the two characters.) I give this a perfect 10/10. Barely true to the book...; Even though the series of books that The Black Cauldron was based on, the Prydain series by Lloyd Alexander, is one of my favorite childrens series, I was disappointed with this movie.  The Black Caldron is the second book in the series, which has nothing to do with the Horned King, which is the villain in the first book, The Book of Three.  Also, Gurgi is not the one who ultimately destroys the cauldron, it is another character, Ellidyr. Also, he does die, for good, he isn't brought back to life by the three O's. In any case, if anyone is going to do a movie about those great adventure books, they should at least get the books straight, and do a series, as opposed to trying to cram the most interesting things into a disjointed jumble of animation, and leaving out such key figures as Coll and Gwydoin. Very Entertaining for Kids and Adults Alike; I saw \"The Black Cauldron\" when it first came out.  I was about six at the time, and ever since then, I had always wondered why I had never heard about it again.  I only had vague memories about it, but I remembered enjoying it. I had heard somewhere that Disney was so ashamed of the film that they had promised never to release it.  However, upon viewing it today, I have no idea what they were so ashamed of.  The movie is very entertaining in its own way; yes, it's very dark, and maybe not appropriate for young children, but I enjoyed it.  There is some excellent bits of animation in it, and it's a pleasure to see some vintage Disney before it started churning out the overblown, empty films it has made recently.  The movie is able to keep a quick pace so that you never get bored.  All in all, I would say that it is not one of Disney's best efforts, but it is certainly nothing to keep hidden away for 10+ years. Interesting, getting a bit scary there though!; For a Disney film, this is one of the first I've seen where the badguy isn't a comical human or something... it's an actual ghostly skull who we meet very quickly. The scenes with him start out very intense and scary (for a Disney movie mind you) and then start to get just more intense and more adventurous as the kids make their way through the castle and stuff. The idea of sacrifice is introduced and used in the movie. Not sure if that's the best thing to have considering that this is a Disney classic. However, the thing that gets sacrificed survives... but I found a flaw. I do believe the witches who made the trade said that only a HUMAN could sacrifice himself into it. While the thing which did wasn't human... yet it still stopped the curse in the end. -confused- But anyway, it was okay, and I have to give they some points for surprising me with the kiss near the end. Wasn't expecting it the way it was done. Anyway, I rate this 7/10. Should've stayed locked away in the vaults; I had forgotten about this film when I first heard Disney was \"finally\" releasing it on video for the first time.  Having become quite a fan of Disney's work over the past few years (never was much of a fan as a kid; go fig), I was anxious to see why they had never released this on video before. Now I know. This film, from the limited research I have done on the subject, apparently nearly sank the animation department at Disney, it did so badly at the box office.  It's no wonder. The shoddy storyline, unlikeable characters, and dated animation make it a wonder how it ever saw the light of day at all. The animation looked as if it could have just as easily been done in 1955 as 1985!  My 9-year-old niece was bored out of her mind.  So was I.  There was very little frightening about it that was actually supposed to be, and I have to agree with the quote I heard from someone that it was the first animated Disney feature to be \"completely without heart\". This movie is good for one thing, however:  if you're really interested, watch this, then watch The Little Mermaid (again, I'm sure), and marvel at the fact that those two movies were made only a couple of years apart (Little Mermaid was apparently already in the production pipeline when Black Cauldron was released; otherwise, we might never have seen it!).  Not only would I not recommend this movie for children, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone other than those into animation history, Disney history, or intense boredom.  Watch The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, even Hercules, before pulling this clunker off the shelf.  That Disney can't be sued for calling it a \"Masterpiece\" is a travesty in itself. A breath of fresh air from the cookie cutter; I must say that i am not a fan of disney movies.  They seem so cookie cutter-Fairy tale, good over evil, six r seven horrible songs from over paid composers, and wrap it up in less than nintey minutes.  This was their exception, a trying of new things, like walt set out to do in the first place.  The story is wonderful, the animation is out of this world, and the comic relief commits suicide in the end!!!! that's the best part!!!  The cuts fuzzy cuddly Gurgi Comits suicide to save his friends!!!! It's great!!! I must admit the hero at times reminded me of Davy jones from the Monkees but that's alright.   I'm a fan of Head also Judge it as a Film; I found this to be an excellent film! The voice acting was brilliant. The music was brilliant. The main characters (good and evil) were brilliant. The action was brilliant. Capable of making you feel emotion - happy, sad, baleful, hilarity, you name it. And I do love the fact that this is one of Disney's darkest. It's my favorite Disney film ever. And if you're gonna tell me \"Read the Books!\" don't bother. I tried the Books and they were horrible. Another overlooked cult classic.; The Black Cauldron is given a bad name by even Disney itself for nearly destroying their animation studio (it was a major flop at the box office, comparable to their films in the 1940s) and for being a departure from the typical Disney format of either musical or just light-hearted joy (for the most part), but the truth is, it only recently got the warm cult reception it deserved back in 1985. Despite having some dull moments, the acting is top notch (especially John Hurt's Horned King), the horror scares, and there is enough action (including a shockingly crude joke that left my mouth wide open) to enjoy it as much as Lloyd Alexander's series. In fact, on Rotten Tomatoes it has a higher rating than Robin Hood or a few of Disney's early-mid 2000s films (55%), which I guess can be agreed with seeing how many critics didn't appreciate the new format, though its execution is not something to be glossed over. See it for yourself; I enjoyed it, but I can't guarantee, especially if you like older Disney films, that your rating will be just as or more favorable. I wanted to like it.  I really did...; For years before I saw this film, I had been a fan of Lloyd Alexander's books.  To me, The Chronicles of Preydain rank alongside Tolkien's Middle Earth and Lewis' Narnia as one of the greatest fantasy worlds of all time.  Based deeply in Welsh legend and Mythology (many elements come directly from The Mabinogion, almost the bible of Welsh mythology) Preydain is easily one of the deepest, and most developed worlds out there.  So, needless to say, when I heard that Disney had a film in the pipeline, I got very excited.  Then I saw it... I can't say that I hated it.  More that I was disappointed.  This wasn't the Preydain I knew.  It was more a fairy tale kingdom than celtic Wales.  And what did they do with the characters?  Gurgi a cute fuzzy monster?  Elonwy turned into a typical damsel in distress?  And where were Coll, or Gwydon?  I'm sorry, but I didn't know these people.  The characters were all different?  And what about the rich sense of legend?  The books had been based deeply on mythology, but the movie took the first two books, sprinkled bits and pieces of them into a script, and added a ton of fairy tale and fantasy cliches. I've always wondered what it is with Disney writers that makes them feel it necessary to screw around with anything and everything (witness the amount of \"creative license\" taken with Pocahantas or Mulan.)  I'm sorry, but you don't have to have cute characters or happy endings on everything.  But Disney's writers think that you must.  And in this case, it cheapened the ending of the film.  One of the major plot points of The Black Cauldron is that the cauldron can only be destroyed by a living person sacrificing themselves by throwing themselves into it.  This was kept in the film.  Yet, when Disney did it, they still copped out to the happy ending by having the three Enchantresses, Ordu, Orwen, and Oregch bring him back to life...  Jeeze! It went on from there.  The absence of the true villan of the Preydain chronicles, Arawn, the lord of the dead, the turning of the fair folk (who in celtic mythology were more akin to elves and dwarves) into stock, albeit grouchy, faries....  The list goes on...  Disney ruined one of my favorite stories, and I can't ever forget that.  Even my love for Disney masterpieces like Beauty and the Beast or 101 Dalmations is tarnished by what they did to some of my favorite books of my youth... I liked it when I first saw it, but now I think it is only a sub-par film; \"The Black Cauldron\" is a film loosely based on a book series known as \"The Chronicles of Prydain\" by Lloyd Alexander about a boy who dreams of adventure, but when a magical pig named Hen Wen is captured, he has to set off on an adventure to find her and bring her back before the evil Horned King uses her to find the Black Cauldron, a weapon used to make dead soldiers come alive. I was about, I would have to say, maybe 8 years old when I first saw it. And I liked it a lot. It was a thrilling adventure. Now, I was not scared of it, but it does have moments that could be frightening to little kids. But that goes for a lot of Disney films. They all have an element of horror in them. It was not until 9th grade when I learned that it was a book, and it was not until I was in my teenage years that I started to read \"The Chronicles of Prydain.\" Now I think that the film version of \"The Black Cauldron\" is only sub-par. And here is why: This version is just the first two books, \"The Book of Three\" and \"The Black Cauldron\" rolled into one movie, with \"The Book of Three\" dominating the story of \"The Black Cauldron.\" In the film, Taran is an Assistant Pig-Keeper, but in the stories, he does not start out an Assistant Pig-Keeper. He starts off by making horseshoes. There is a character who is Taran's mentor named Dallben in the film version. But in the books, there are two characters, Dallben and Coll. What they did was have the characters of Dallben and Coll meshed as one. Dallben is an old enchanter. One might equate him to Gandalf or Merlin because of his wisdom and his appearance. Coll is the one with the bald crown. The Princess Eilonwy is an interesting character as well. In the books, she is a chatterbox. In the film, they cut the chatter down. But they keep her independent mind in the film, which is a good thing. Also, her bauble floats in the film. But it does not in the books, it only lights up at her command. The bard, Fflewddur Fflam, is not at all like he is in the books. In the film, they portray him as an old man, but in the books, he is quite young, and has spiky yellow hair. Gurgi is pretty much the same as he is in the books, except Taran meets him when Gurgi tries to strangle him. There are a ton of important characters left out of this film, and I was not pleased with that. One other part of the film that I did not care for was how they introduced the Fair Folk. They have them as fairies, but they are not like that at all. They are dwarfs, well, some of them are. Doli, the one who helps the companions to the place where the Black Cauldron resides, is not elderly. He is young as well. And the witches that live in the Marshes of Morva, Orddu, Orwen, and Orgoch, hardly match their descriptions in the stories. And the magic sword that Taran takes from the Horned King's castle, which is known as Dynrwyn, can only be handled by someone of noble worth, and Taran does not prove himself of that in \"The Book of Three,\" nor in \"The Black Cauldron,\" which only mentions Dyrnwyn once. The Horned King, now this was disappointing. In the film, they present him as an old emperor, but he is not like that at all. He is a warlord, and a young strong one at that. He does not speak at all in the stories, and he works for a higher power known as Arawn, Death-Lord of Annuvin, which they roll both Annuvin and Spiral Castle, the castle that the Horned King inhabits in the film, into one country. There is a character who works for the Horned King in the film called Creeper, which the makers of the cartoon created. Creeper does not exist in the books. There are tons of other changes made, but I will not list them, simply because although I do not care for \"The Black Cauldron,\" I do not want to spoil it for you. So, I say this to you because if you read the books, then you might be disappointed by the film. But if you have not read them, or if you have and you will appreciate it anyway, then feel free to see it. Is this Disney's worst animated feature?; I think not, but a strong case can be made.  SOMETHING sets it apart, and it's this: it's not so much a Disney feature as a Saturday morning cartoon, part of the same world as He Man and the Masters of the Universe, with more than a passing resemblance to other backlot fantasies of the 1980s - I refer not to minor masterpieces like `Ladyhawk' or expensive fiascos like `Willow', but to things with titles like `Syzgar: Sword of Destiny'. It's SO echt-80s fantasy that it almost works.  It's good to see Disney wandering over some new ground and bringing back the occasional luridly dark and lushly cheesy image.  In a fitful way they grabbed the unfamiliar genre and milked it for all it was worth. Unfortunately it's not worth very much.  You know the drill: a hero from out in the sticks sets out on arbitrary Dungeons-and-Dragons type quest to recover the magic whatever it may be in order to defeat one of Sauron's distant cousins.  The hero here is Taran, and the quest ...  Well, there's this cauldron that can turn corpses into loyal undead servants, and a villain called the Horn King who is after the cauldron, and a magical pig - Taran's pig - who alone can tell the Horned King where the cauldron is.  If the Horned King finds the cauldron he will take over the world and make everyone into an undead slave.  The solution, clearly, is to kill the pig.  But Taran doesn't: and moreover, he is willing at one point to let the Horned King know where the cauldron is in exchange for the pig's life.  This is surely carrying sentiment too far.  This is a deeply confused quest and it's usually unclear just what Taran hopes to achieve. Characters are weak: the Horned King is a kind of rococo Skeletor, about as menacing as the average action figure; his henchmen are the kind that shout, `Catch them, you fools'; Taran is as shallow is a rain puddle; and the characters he picks up along the way follow him about like flies, with as much reason.  (It's not all Disney's fault: the author of the books also had a tendency to substitute mannerism for character.)  And the dialogue is so baldly utilitarian it might have been better if the characters hadn't been allowed to speak at all.  I wonder why this is.  I'm sure if one scoured the five books one could have found at least 80 minutes' worth of decent speech, somewhere. All this is bad; but what makes it heartbreaking is the poor animation.  (It was a real shock reading the credits, because I recognised ALL the names.  Everyone involved has done much better work since.)  Many of the flaws are the kind you'd expect to see of a Saturday morning: Gurgi suddenly growing an extra coat of skin whenever someone grabs him by the neck; Taran and Eilonwy running as if they want NOT to get away, away from pursuers who are giving chase as if to avoid catching up; weighty rocks made of chalk and geese with wings of rubber.  I can't capture the low quality by citing instances.  The animation is just not up to scratch, and some characters - such as Taran, who is on screen virtually all the time - NEVER move convincingly. In short: a bad movie.  But I must admit I sort of enjoyed it, in a way I didn't enjoy, say, `Oliver and Company' (which IS Disney's worst animated feature).  I can't think of many objective grounds of recommendation.  One thing worth mentioning is Disney animation's only extended cleavage gag.  While it's not in the least erotic I'll bet the animator enjoyed himself. Still a piece of art in animation! To be seen despite bad critics!; I recently spot into the Black Cauldron again after having seen it for the first and last time in the mid 80's. Two things to say: First, this would have been a Don Bluth Studios production, nobody would have never shouted at it. The Black Cauldron do not follow the Disney philosophy at all and we almost all agree on that point. This movie is dark on its overall at a point that we can barely think it is targeting a very young audience. Dark movies were certainly a trend in the 80's, \"The Dark Crystal\" or \"Legend\" are very good examples of how this ambiance was present and used into the movie industry at that period of time. Second, the movie is not bad at all! Try to see it from a different perspective. Animation is just a piece of art and at first glance we can easily guess this is a Disney. Characters are nicely drawn, the princess is very cute, Taran is a teenager full of energy and willing to do well....the villain is freaking frightening, probably the most scary Disney villain of all times! But it is true something is weak in this movie : the plot and roles of some of the characters. What is the one of Helowny for example? Apart bringing the required cute female presence in the story what does she add? Giving advice or supporting Taran in his quest? More drama would have been created if she was the one to jump into the Cauldron! Taran and Helowny both feel attraction for each other...the movie is dark enough to let the cute princess die bringing the dramatization level a notch up (and bring her back to life for the happy ending). Just an idea but this makes more sense to me than Gurki sacrifice. There are also a lot of discontinuity in the animation reflecting production issues this movie ran into (team changes). I have the feeling sometimes that pieces of the storyboard have been stitched together without a proper transition. On the overall we feel something is missing in the story to be convincing but we can't judge it like a total garbage. This is a classic animation movie which used also new features for an outstanding result on the screen at that time! It is a controverted one for sure but still a classic to have in your Disney collection! Not awful, not great, and not what I expected; The problem with THE BLACK CAULDRON is not that it's dark. It's that it tries to do \"dark\" and doesn't do it well. THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME managed to be more dark and evocative than this. From what I can tell, CAULDRON wouldn't have been better with the edited-out stuff left in, either. Some of that material would have just contrasted much too jarringly with the movie's inescapable, if diluted, \"Disney-ness.\" (Having learned about some of said edited-out material, I'm amazed at the tone-deafness of the people responsible. They may have thought they were pushing the envelope, but even had this movie been better it was not the place for those kinds of attempts.) The best part of this movie is that it doesn't have any songs. But some choices regarding characters just don't make sense. What is the \"Horned King\" supposed to be? Wouldn't he have been better as a deranged, power-hungry human in a creepy costume (which, as I've recently learned, is exactly what he was in the source book) than as some kind of unexplained skeleton-being? Gurgi is not only annoying and difficult to understand, but he seems entirely out of place in the \"ancient\" setting. The minstrel guy serves NO plot function whatsoever -- I hate Disney characters like that, even if they're funny! The plot, whatever its faults (including the fact that there's no background or context provided for most of it), was reasonably involving. And I was pretty much OK with it until it got to the end, and Gurgi was miraculously brought back to life. Sorry, but that put the nail in the plot's coffin as far as I was concerned. Better than the reputation suggests; The Black Cauldron will never go down as a classic in Disney's history. It was a complete commercial failure upon first release and it's somewhat easy to understand why - no musical numbers (just an underscore), no fairy tale romance, steps on the dark side an awful lot etc. Negatives: The protagonist is very irritating, the voice work for Taran, Eilonwey and Gurgi is grating and distracting. There's a few animation inconsistencies and the story-line does feel a little scattered and unfocused at times. Examples of this is when they encounter the witches and the fairies. The jump scares are quite overwhelming too - it makes any viewer anxious of what's going to happen next. Positivies: The villain is seriously one of Disney's best. The Horned King is haunting, mesmerizing, powerful and terrifying all at once. He's very impressive and I would class him in my top 10 Disney villains. The animation, though inconsistent, is very beautifully drawn at times and detailed (the design of the castle). I also love the scene where the Horned King summons the dead and they march together. It's very haunting to watch but also chilling in a satisfying way. Yes, The Black Cauldron is certainly not for everyone. And it's definitely not geared towards children. But none the less I enjoy it and it's one which I will considering re-watching soon. Bad; Need to say, the only good thing about The Black Cauldron it's good quality of backgrounds animation, a quality that was not seen in the Disney studio since \"Sleeping Beauty\" (1959). But honestly, I don't care if this film has become \"cult\". Remains as bad as ever. First, Taran is the most forgetabble protagonist in Disney history. Unlike other friendly boys as Mowgli (1967) or Arthur (1963), Taran is boring and has no charisma. All other characters also suffer from the same problem. The villain looks like a character who was taken from some cheap episode of Scooby-Doo. Fairies / gnomes (or what the hell are those things) sound like dull rip-offs of the Seven Dwarfs. Gurgi was created to be friendly and for we to care with him, but he's just an animated version of Jar Jar Binks we wish to see dead. As if things were not already worse enough, the script of this film is problematic. In the beginning, we have a nut with \"magical\" powers (in my opinion the only sympathetic character in the movie), which seems to be the essential key to the climax of the film, but in half the movie to the end, she simply leaves to follow Taran and disappear in history. In my view, a serious flaw script. Add to the fact that history doesn't have any memorable moment, and we realized the disaster that The Black Cauldron is. Disney's best film ever; Please. Spare me the lecture about \"The Little Mermaid\" or \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\" Face it: they were dull! They had no redeeming value! Why is it that Disney's best titles-- \"Robin Hood\" (1973) and \"Cauldron\" are always overlooked? So, yes, the movie butchered Lloyd Alexander's series. So what? The world of books is completely different from the world of movies. If you can't take that, I'm truly sorry. Go read a book. \"The Black Cauldron\" is the fascinating, stunning tale of a brave but foolish boy, a precognitive pig, and an evil Horned King who will stop at nothing to become immortal. I always include this with my \"Best of '80s Fantasy\" marathons-- \"Ladyhawke,\" \"Willow,\" \"Krull,\" and so forth, with no \"Excalibur\" or \"The Neverending Story\"-- because it was such an amazing, imaginative movie that it deserves recognition as such. From the clever Witches of Morva scene to Gurgi's laments about munchings and crunchings, \"The Black Cauldron\" is why, after all these years, we still put up with Disney. Tolerable, but the books are better; The movie's okay, but as usual when Disney sets out to turn books into movies, something gets lost. rather than do the tale of one book out of the five (six, technically, counting the one of short stories), Disney attempts to cram two books into one movie, with a slight reference to the final book (the kiss). The characterization is off, plot points are missed, and what emerges is an okay movie, but is essentially trash for fans of the books. These fans, and I am one, must watch the movie without expectations, in order for it to be decent. It ain't half bad (ain't half good, neither); There were many good things going on in the Black Cauldron.  First, there  were NO SONGS, which really helped move things along.  Second, the villain  was truly frightening, the supporting cast was a lot of fun, and the movie's  breakneck pace held my interest and entertained me throughout.  But,  there were some bad things as well.  Taran wasn't really a character at  all.  Every important thing that happened to him was by luck or accident.   And at the end of the story he's right back where he started.  Also, the  plot was little more than a succession of action sequences, with little  sense holding it together.  The heroes simply fell out of one situation  into the next, perhaps the result of squeezing two full-length novels into  one movie.  And don't get me started on the ending.  Our hero stumbles  through the picture so that -- his furball sidekick can become the true  hero of the piece.  Yech.  Still, I was entertained, and I'd see  it again.   But for those looking for the REAL Black Cauldron, read \"The Chronicles of  Prydain\" by Lloyd Alexander.  You'll be glad you did. Like Having Your Childhood Raped; In 1985 I was a prime candidate for watching this movie: right age and having read the original books. Luckily I saw a promo before I got too excited and never did see it. Now I chose to watch the film for some reason, and I must say: Don't. The animation has not withstood the test of time and the story is very poorly written. That's not even mentioning the fact that I want to maim and kill every last bastard on the writing team for so completely ruining the best piece of children's literature in the world. Read the books. Shambolic film still worth seeing; \"The Black Cauldron\" provides us with \"Exhibit A\" of the disorganized nature of the Disney organization from the mid-1970s through the mid-80s. The company's feature films were attracting smaller and smaller audiences, and no real creative force had emerged since Walt Disney's death in 1966. By the mid- to late-70s, it was clear that new ideas needed to be tried. The phenomenal success of \"Star Wars\" appeared to offer a sure-fire way to box-office success: sci-fi/fantasy movies. At the same time, Disney Studio's full-length animated features continued their descent from the heights scaled in 1959's \"Sleeping Beauty\", at first downscaling the subject matter, then progressing to less and less impressive animation, and finally combining the first two trends with boring storytelling (see \"The Fox and the Hound\" - 1981). It was in this context that pre-production began on \"The Black Cauldron\" in the late 1970s. From an artistic standpoint, its goals were two-fold. First, the film was to recapture the lead in animation quality that Disney had traditionally held, while the second goal was to incorporate the advances in animation and subject matter made in the 1970s (i.e., playing \"catch up\"). Some early decisions were good: the source material was top-notch. Lloyd Alexander's \"Chronicles of Prydain\" are fantastic works of fantasy for the young adult - I loved them as a middle-schooler in the mid-80s, and the choice to film the story in 70mm widescreen harkened back to the glory days of \"Sleeping Beauty.\" Unfortunately, not much else worked. The studio's writers did a terrible job of condensing the first two books of Alexander's series, and we end up caring little for the characters that emerge, or for the plot as it unfolds. Also, the movie's tone is uneven. Overall, the work is very dark and un-Disney, which would've been fine had it been executed better. Further, the grimness of the plot doesn't mesh with occasionally clumsy and earthy attempts at humor, and the character animation fluctuates between sober naturalism and exaggerated, cartoonish mannerisms (stretching ears, gaping mouths, etc.) Still, some of the shots are stunning and rank among the best in the history of hand-drawn animation (e.g., multiplaned exterior shot of the Horned King's castle, beautiful backgrounds within the same, Hen-Wen's capture by the Horned King's creatures). The result of this mish-mash was a box-office flop ($25 million to make, $5 million in ticket sales upon its 1985 release). In short, see this film for its often-impressive animation and intermittent charm. Be sure to get the newly-available widescreen version on DVD. Bemoan the end of the era of stunning hand-drawn animation (Disney has closed up its shop; \"Home on the Range\" was its penultimate hand-drawn feature). Don't expect a classic, but appreciate the vision of its artistry - even if the final product didn't quite mesh satisfactorily. \"The Black Cauldron\" is a noble failure. Tragic spoiling of a classic tale (Includes spoiler); I must admit that I always feel those who praise this film haven't read the book. The story is told so much better there. The animation isn't up to Disney's usual standard, but far more importantly the entire story, including the noble and tragic ending, has been disneyfied, because we can't have people sacrificing their lives for their friends in a kiddie's movie. Oh no. It might upset people. They didn't want to tell the wonderful story which is there, and instead produced a drab, flat throwaway filler piece before their next big film. The only consolation is that there's no songs. Read the Chronicles of Prydain. Read Lloyd Alexander's 'The Black Cauldron'. Tell me I'm wrong. Not the best, not the worst; Plot in a nutshell: Taran is an assistant pig keeper for the old wizard Dallben in the land of Prydain who dreams of being a great heroic leader of men. Then trouble starts brewing when the Evil Horned King embarks on a dark quest to unleash the power of the Black Cauldron and attempts to kidnap Taran's pig Hen Wen, who happens to be an Oracular Pig. When Taran is given the task of taking the pig to safety, he loses her to the Horned King's forces and must embark on a quest to reclaim her, which introduces him to the hyper-talkative Princess Eilonwy, the slightly untruthful bard Flewder Flam, and the goofy little man-dog creature Gurgi, and then they in turn must embark on a quest to find the Black Cauldron itself and destroy it somehow. Well meaning if unsuccessful adaptation of the first two books in Lloyd Alexander's \"The Chronicles of Prydain\" book series, combining the plots of the first two books, #1 \"The Book of 3\" and #2 \"The Black Cauldron\", with the second book's plot taking center stage primarily. Many important characters from the books such as Prince Gwydion, Coll, Adaon, Morgant, and Elydir among others were lost in the translation from book to film. It's not un-entertaining, just uneven. Good animation and good music by Elmer Bernstein helps. Disney needs more films like this!; I am sick of the marketing.  I am sick of the lame musical numbers.  I am  sick of talking animals. I am QUITE sick of insulting cultural inaccuracies  (think Pocahontas and Mulan).   THE BLACK CAULDRON sticks out like a sore thumb in a crop of happy,  whimsical garbage that has come out of the Disney studios in the last  decade.  I remember when a Disney film had real plot, real art, real  characters, and this may have been the last of the bunch.  In the pre -Eisner era, Disney films had some credibility.  Its no wonder that it took  so long for this one to make it to video.  But I am rather pleased with it.   --The SurgeBot Something for the darker children of the world; I realise there are many who say that 'The Black Cauldron' is by far Disney's worst cartoon. I disagree. Although i have nothing per say against light princess stories or the animal fun Disney usually goes in for: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Fox and the Hound, The Jungle Book, Cinderella... etc. I say it's always nice to have a change, something for the less stereo typical, darker children to enjoy. I didn't know i was one of these children until i saw 'The black cauldron'. which quickly became my favourite Disney film. I'm sure I am not the only one who has watched many Disney films and not been fully satisfied, ending it and thinking 'yes but that wouldn't really happen would it' thought maybe it's a bit to happy. Thought that maybe we need a better villain. The first time i saw 'The Jungle Book' i was fine with Shear Carn but Ca the snake terrified me. You're never afraid of the people you're supposed to be afraid of in these films. In Lady and the Tramp you're supposed to be scared of the Rat and creatures like that but i was too busy being completely freaked by the cats. In Beauty and the Beast it wasn't Gaston i was afraid of or the beast but that machine her father had. In The Little Mermaid it wasn't Ursula but those 'unfortunate soul' things. In Snow White it wasn't the witch it was the trees. The same applied for all of these Disney films except the Black Cauldron. The villain is what makes this film. From the moment the film opens you see this terrifying black pot with this deep dark voice over which is then contrasted with the introduction of Taren, the central character and his pig, Hen. It turns out the horned king is searching for the black cauldron which will give him the power to raise an army from the dead and to find the black cauldron the king will come looking for Hen, a pig with strange divining powers so Taren (who dreams of adventure and the like) must take Hen to the cottage on the other side of the wood and keep her hidden there. On the way however Hen is stolen by some terrifying flying dragon monster things and Taren had to follow them to the horned kings castle and get hen back. The Horned King is as frightening as for once he should be and voiced by the immensely talented John Hurt. He is the most affective animated villain ever on screen and i say that with confidence. However to lighten the mood a little he is accompanied by a delightful but much abused little green goblin who is great fun as well as sweet and quite charming even if he is a little mischievous. Also along the way Taren comes across a sweet but strong minded princess, a highly dishonest but charming bard and the most irritating character ever put on screen. I can't remember his name but it's irritating. He is the one thing i am afraid the brings down the entire film in Disney's lame attempt to introduce comedy into the mix. The film closes with a dramatic and thrilling climax and does not disappoint. It was a welcome relief and change from every other Disney movie and a great success as far as i'm concerned. you might not like it but i always will. the Animation is poor and so is the script but the story and the characters shine though and will remain one of my favourite cartoons of all time whatever anyone else says about it. Dark and Violent. The Black Cauldron Was Unseccesful; *May Contain UnHarmful Spoilers* \"Hidden by darkness. Guarded by witches. Discovered by a boy. Stolen by a king. Whoever owns it will rule the world. Or destroy it.\" The Black Cauldron was a well-attempted film full of excellent potential. Unfortunately, this film was a bomb, and it was disappointing to watch. The movie took seven years to make, that's a long time, even for animation. I can see every dollar was put into every frame, and I can tell that they believed money was not a problem. Disney certainly had the money, but they surely didn't want to throw it all away. The success was very little, and it wasn't that it was horrible horribly, it was a little too dark and it just missed something. This was Disney's first animated PG movie, okay, it was violent, but not much more frightening than other Disney films in my opinion. The Great Mouse Detective was just as creepy and Beauty and the Beast was just a scary. But that's of little importance because they were much better films. The thing about The Black Cauldron is that it was shown to be dark and scary, but I think they could've have given the Horned King (John Hurt) a better portrayal evil. I enjoyed the characters, mostly. Disney has always had its little annoying side characters to bring the comic relief, but as far as Gurgi\n",
       " Taran (Grant Bardsley) is a young man who dreams of one day becoming a great warrior. All he has learned is to be the best pig keeper assistant, what a sad life. Taran lives his with uncle Dallben (Freddie Jones) at a little farm along with their precious piggy, named Hen Wen. Hen Wen is a special pig for he has powers to see the future. Ounce the Horned King of the dead discovers of Hen Wen's powers he immediately summons his soldiers from the underworld to capture the bacon. The Horned King desires the dark Black Cauldron that can conjure an army of infinite numbers. Taran gets to fulfill his life long dream, to be sent on a grand expedition full of danger and a promise to keep the pig away from evils hands. Daydreaming, Taran inevitable loses Hen Wen and is in fear of breaking his promise. He calls out for him, but instead of a pig he finds a, ummm, something named Gurgi (John Byner). Gurgi is a very annoying furry creature that plays the best friend act on Taran to get his juicy apple. He gets the apple, but loses his new best friend. Hen Wen was captured and brought to the dark whereabouts of the Horned King. Taran sneaks in to get his pig, but ends up captured and thrown into the dungeon. I would like to point out that the attitude of the Horned King was unrealistic. They call him the definition of evil and the master of sin, yet he shows signs of kindness of sparing Taran's life to be locked up instead, and will only strangle his little troll sidekick for failure. For a Disney film this is acceptable, but I just don't like exaggerating a character. Anyway, when Taran is locked up he meets a young princess, named Eilonwy (Susan Sheridan), who has been captured before him because it was thought that her strange floating ball of light could tell the future. Pointlessly to say, I like the young teenage relationship, while their hormones is blooming and discovering attractiveness to the opposite sex. So they both argue time to time, but they like each other overall. One thing I didn't understand was the significance of the magical sword of the long dead king that Taran finds. An ancient sword with magic to cut through metal, and it fights with a mind of its own. I would have thought that it would have more of a purpose to the plot other than it making Taran feel like a warrior, and a bargain trade for the cauldron. He really loved that sword, and felt invincible wielding it. I'll leave the story at that, and let you decide the rest. The Black Cauldron was impressive for its looks, but disappointing for most everything else. The only characters that I cared for were Taran and Eilonwy, and the Horned King was pretty cool. Everybody else was just annoying and pointless. I've pointed out Gurgi, and there's Fflewddur Fflam (Nigel Hawthorne), weird name I know, who tags along with his very expressionist harp. I could see the film going on without these two characters, though on the other hand without having Gurgi\n",
       " Though there is one thing that I find highly interesting, and that's all the sh*t this movie went through. Just count the dollars and the days this movie had in the process. It was expensive and it took several years to accomplish. However, the numbers were low for the movies prophet and it took more than a decade to come to video. Fascinating really, and despite this film being rated PG it went through some major editing. The new chairman of Disney, Jeffrey Katzenberg, had ordered the filmmakers to redo and edit the more intense and dark themes that would draw away a family audience. Here's the link if interested. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Cauldron_%28film%29 I really truly wanted to like this film, really. This film isn't horrible, and I would watch it again if I get the chance. Though I have to give this one the cold slip for a project failed. **/**** Stars The Black Cauldron (1985): Rated PG for some violent images Bizarrely patchy, very dark -yet captivating; The story of the black cauldron is essentially concerned with the very real threat of evil and this dark atmosphere makes for interesting viewing. Unlike most other Disney films this one offers few moments of light relief and thus begs the question is this a film suitable for children under five? However, its uncompromising, unsentimental darkness elevates it in my view above the more common fare usually dished out by those in the animation trade. The story itself is sometimes patchily told -too much has been compressed into too little time, and often it feels unfortunately cut. This aside the film is to be recommended, not least because it is so little known -compared to, for example, the incredibly rubbishy Lion King or the vomitous Pocahontas. A good yet forgettable movie; The Black Cauldron is about a young boy who must look after his magical pig. He loses it and must stop the black cauldron's evil.  Like my summary, this movie has many plot holes.  One of the more violent of the Disney movies, The Black Cauldron is a terrific yet forgettable movie.  It just can't stand against The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, which is sad because it is truly a work of art. I Love The 80's! One Of Disney's Most Unrecognized Classics.; i actually don't really love the eighties. don't hate it. but i'm pretty indifferent. it really wasn't much of a stand out decade aside from the possible notoriety of it's President. however, as far as Disney feature length, hand drawn animation goes, i have a real fond spot for the forgotten decade in their legacy. the eighties Disney films are very maligned and under-appreciated. and it's not very justified or fair. the eighties produced some of Disney's most memorable and endearing animated features. aside from 'The Little Mermaid', i've always thought the nineties animated features from Disney were somewhat over-rated. the nineties animated features always leave me a little cold and they feel over-blown and over-hyped and produced. the eighties animated films like 'Fox and the Hound', 'Great Mouse Dective', 'Oliver and Co.', had a sweeter, more endearing and modest quality that was lacking in the nineties. the nineties was cold. the eighties cartoon features are much cuter. 'The Black Cauldron' is definitely the best from the eighties. what it lacks as an adaptation of Lloyd Alexander's 'Prydain' books (i miss the Raven on Taran's shoulder), it makes up for as a excellent Disney cartoon feature. the animation and styling are unmistakably Disney. and as with all Disney adaptations it owes more to Disney than the source it's adapted from. that's the way it should be. Disney films should be recognizable as Disney. even though there is much waxing about 'Cauldron' being too scary and intense for little kids and how it has no heart, most of that isn't all that valid. 'Cauldron' is a very 'G' rated experience and not 'PG'. there is no sex or swearing or even any real violence. it's a 'G'. it's also a very cute and adorable film. Lloyd Alexander's books were a little darker and not cute at all. Disney has managed to Disneyfy and cutesyfy the stories, but it all still works. Johnn Byner's Gurgi is a art drawing exercise in cuddly cuteness. 'Cauldron' is one of Disney's most memorable of the later features. it boast startling hand drawn animation, handsome production design, and a wonderful film score by Elmer Bernstein. i know old school Disney. probably better than most. i spent most of my youth studying old school Disney and watching all the films. a lot of people can't always say that. i love 'The Black Cauldron' and think it's another one of those under-appreciated Disney gems. Waiting for a Classic, getting a Clunker; In 1975, I flew to Orlando Florida to visit Disney World. While shopping in the stores, I bought a book about Disney animation. Included in it was some rough concept art for THE BLACK CAULDRON. I remember hoping that the movie would be released, soon. Being 14 at the time, I thought of Disney movies as pretty much lame kiddie movies, but this looked pretty cool. Fast forward a decade, to me as a graduating senior from college. I remember hearing that the movie was in theaters, then POOF!, gone. Never to be heard of again, or so we thought. In the early 1990's a wife of a friend of mine was a manager at a local Disney Store, and I asked her when BLACK CAULDRON might be available on VHS. She rolled her eyes up in her head, and said, 'Pretty much, never!'. Apparently a lot of folks asked that same question, and she told me that BC, is the movie that Disney chooses to forget. Then, a few years later, we all went to one of the theme parks at Disney and were looking in a store that sold movie posters for their `great' movies. In the huge stack of `Little Mermaid' and `Aladdin' posters was one for BLACK CAULDRON. My friend's wife seemed amazed at finding it, and she said that `Disney must be considering re-releasing the movie if this poster is here'. And surprise, in 1998, we found it on the shelves of our local video store. My wife and I decided to preview it before we let our young daughters see it. And man, am I glad we did. Truly NOT a movie for the under 7 or so set. Dark, deep, and troubled, is the best way to describe BC. I do like more `mature' animation, but this seemed a mish mash of past Disney style, fantasy art, and a move in a new direction of animation. The other disappointing part of the 1998 release was, that it's in Full Screen format. What a let down as the movie is one of only two, I believe, 70 MM format animated Disney movies. SLEEPING BEAUTY, being the other, and that WAS available in VHS wide screen format. The print that was used to make the tape, also appeared to be very poor, and it appeared to have been edited, as one or two scene transitions didn't seem smooth. I may rent the DVD, and give it another try, but as previous posters have stated, it's not for everyone. And definitely NOT for the wee ones, who are best suited for `LITTLE MERMAID'.  Animation at its BEST!; I saw this movie when I was 6 or 7 years old.  Now, maybe others believe it is not for kids, and they are probably right.  But I saw it and never had nightmares.  I'm 19 years old now.  I didn't remember much about it except for adorable Gurgi!  My brother and I had a Gurgi doll and used to pretend he would go around stealing apples saying \"crunchies and munchies.\"  I didn 't even remember the Horned King.  I watched it this weekend and fell in love with the movie again.  I recommend it for adults and older children.  The parents will have to be the judge of whether or not their children are mature enough to handle the evil people.  But it is definitely a GREAT animated movie. Enchanting...; \"The Black Cauldron\" is an enchanting as well as an exciting story about courage, self-sacrifice and love. With beautiful animation, a superb voice cast, and riveting story, this movie will keep your eyes glued to the screen from start to finish. *MILD Spoilers* Set in a land called Prydain, young and adventure hungry Taran finds himself becoming involved in a plot to stop the wicked Horned King from finding the legendary Black Cauldron - a dangerous pot that can create an army of the undead. Teaming up with a lovely young princess, a bumbling bard, and a pesky critter named Gurgi, Taran quickly decides to take up the quest to save all of Prydain, and get to the Cauldron before the Horned King does... *Spoilers end here* I won't give it all away for you though. Get it and see it for yourself. It's definitely not a movie for little tykes, but if you have older kids or teens who like fantasy, they'll most likely enjoy it... and I'm sure anyone will, if they give it a chance. The weakest Disney movie is still pot-boiling stuff; This is definitely one of the weakest Disney movies, and it certainly didn't help that the Disney studios were on a low. It is worse than oliver and Company, which I liked. I liked this one too, but it is not for children. I haven't read the books, but even without reading them, you could tell the voice actors weren't given much to work with. The characters are likable but badly underdeveloped, especially Taran, who I thought was a little bland. There were some truly splendid animated sequences, but most of them were inside the castle, like the death of the Horned King(highlight of the film for me), as well as Morva, and the Fairy Kingdom. Creeper and Gurgi were a little annoying at first, but I definitely preferred Gurgi. The music by Elmer Bernstein was very dramatic, such a shame because the story didn't match that. However, on a positive note, the most impressive elements of the movie, were the scene of the cauldron destroying the Horned King, the wonderful sombre intonation of John Huston in the prologue and a sinister voice-over by John Hurt as the Horned King(who was really frightening). Speaking of John Hurt, I have an issue with Roger Ebert rating this film over The Elephant Man(Hurt's best film). In my opinion The elephant Man is much better than this, which is a 6.5/10 from me. Bethany Cox The film that Disney would like you to forget?; Version I saw: Amazon Instant Video stream Actors: 6/10 Plot/script: 5/10 Photography/visual style: 5/10 Music/score: 6/10 Overall: 6/10 The Black Cauldron has a reputation as the film about which Disney are faintly embarrassed, and would rather people didn't know about. The film has never had the publicity of others in the Disney stable, taking a long time to reach home video and DVD release. It would seem to have been a ruinously expensive box office flop, and investigations into the background reveal board-level personality clashes and fractious internal politics. I don't know about you, but that sounds intriguing to me. The film has problems, certainly. It is generally agreed to be considerably darker in tone than almost any other Disney film, and rather darker then studio execs were comfortable with. What first struck me, though, was not the tonal darkness but physical darkness. Throughout the early part, it was irritatingly difficult to even see what was happening on screen, even with brightness and contrast turned up to maximum. Thereafter, too, there is an odd discrepancy between the sumptuous, subtly shaded, almost canvas painting style backgrounds, and the simplistic design of the foreground characters, all thick lines and blocks of colour. There is a comparison to be drawn between The Black Cauldron and The Sword in the Stone. Apart from the medieavalish period setting, there is a distinct similarity in character design, and indeed the art style of the film in general. Thematically, though, it has far less in common with Disney in general than it does with Brian Froud's faerie illustrations and Lord of the Rings. In terms of the latter, some of the similarities are a bit too close to comfort. We have a Sauron-clone with Nazgul-clones, other incompetent lackeys (less unique, but still something in common) and a Gollum-clone. Admittedly, it could be that these were inserted by Disney based on Tolkien's popularity, and even if they are in Lloyd Alexander's source text, The Chronicles of Prydain, he would not be the first or the last to copy the seminal master of fantasy fiction. The writing has other problems. I found it short on the honed wit that brightens Disney pieces both before and since. Some bemoan the American committee style of writing, claiming that it leads to a certain soullessness, but at least a room full of brains can be counted on to deliver the zingers. Also, the main character Taran has very little about him to incline me to root for him. He is not strong, which is fairly standard, but neither is he clever, or brave, or even witty. His only real virtue seems to be luck, and even this abandons him at times in the narrative. This is especially a problem given how long he spends alone before companions are introduced. At least when other characters appear, they include a strong female character. Or do they? Certainly, Princess Eilonwy has personality, and a more engaging screen presence than Taran, but for the most part she seems content to tag along behind, and be a bit sassy. Still, that's a step up from Sleeping Beauty. So why 6 out of 10 and not lower? Two factors: Elmer Bernstein's excellent, strident orchestral score - exactly what one would expect from a cinematic legend of his pedigree - and the ending. I will try not to spoil it, but I found the deviation from the \"hero saves the day\" convention very refreshing. The virtues displayed in obtaining victory are not the sort to be usually found in this kind of film. That papered over a lot of cracks for me. In some ways, I was a little disappointed that it was not more repellent, or otherwise inappropriate, which would have been an entertainment in itself. I suppose that will have to wait until I can seek out and watch 'Song of the South'... A Worthy Effort, Though it Falls Short; Disney's \"The Black Cauldron\" is an uneven film, with an anticlimactic ending. The protagonist confronts the villain too early in the film to lend their conflict gravity. The villain's demise is ultimately unsatisfying and the film's resolution seems rushed. It is fair to say that the protagonist does go through a change in his view of the world, particularly what it means to be a hero, which lends the film merit. The tone mixes light-hearted Disney humor with the darker tones of the \"sword and sorcery\" genre popular in the 1980s. The film is ultimately interesting, in large part due to the animation and mature themes imbued in the plot. I loved that Disney, prior to the Eisner era, was willing to explore a dark sword and sorcery fantasy concept in its animation. This movie is no fairy tale, like \"Cinderella\" or \"Sleeping Beauty.\" I doubt Walt would have green lit such a grim project, which has more in common with \"Lord of the Rings\" than Dopey and Grumpy. A few reviewers have complained that \"The Black Cauldron\" does not look or feel like a typical Disney animated movie; that's why I enjoy it! The cartoon is based on a book for older children and preteens written in the 1960s, which in turn was inspired by Welsh mythology. The aura of high fantasy pervades the animation, which lends it an element of \"coolness\" that no doubt would appeal to older viewers than is the case for Disney animated films. The characters' facial appearances have the look typical of 1960s to mid-1980s Disney cartoon movies, so expect that. The Horned King and Creeper look pretty cool; while not particularly vile when compared to the likes of the Wicked Queen in \"Snow White\" or Stromboli in \"Pinocchio,\" the Horned King is one the scariest-looking Disney villains designed. His skull-face and antlered cloak evoke a sense of the sinister supernatural not present in much of the Disney fare. His army of undead soldiers, the \"Cauldron Born,\" are especially creepy--again, preteens who feel too old for cute mice and who want an introduction to high fantasy may be drawn by the ghoulish villains. This film also has a bit more realistic violence than most Disney cartoons, which may also attract older kids: the protagonist's cheek actually *bleeds* after a dragon attack, which is uncharacteristic for a Disney character! Granted, the plot and themes are pretty sloppy compared to Peter Jackson's \"Lord of the Ring\" films, but for any kid who wants a more \"mature\" fantasy-themed Disney movie may enjoy what \"The Black Cauldron\" has to offer. This film came out when high fantasy was en vogue, and films like \"The Dark Crystal,\" \"Conan the Barbarian\" and \"Willow\" were popular. Sadly, this movie was a flop, and marked a dead end for Disney's attempts to animate dark high fantasy cartoons for an older audience. I sometimes think of what could have been: Disney might have released a slew of animated features based on adult fantasy novels, like \"Wheel of Time\" or Herbert's \"Dune;\" hell, they may have ended up producing the first \"R\" rated Disney animated film, perhaps an adaptation of \"Game of Thrones.\" Sadly, this film's ill-fated production precluded that possibility, and it would not be until \"The Lion King\" and the Pixar movies that Disney would market its cartoons to children and adults simultaneously. While not a classic, \"The Black Cauldron\" is worth a watch. Watch it to experience a truly unique Disney venture: its first foray into high fantasy. Good, but bad parts too; This, I must say is one of Disney's better storylines. The thing is, though, it moves rather quickly. For the most part, I loved it; the villain was spooky and scary and fun characters filled in the story. However, the animation at parts was bad. Sometimes, it looked as though the characters were behind a blue screen because they animated the characters and sometimes used real video footage for the background. That can sometimes looks weird. However, I do highly recommend this to you, and I also recommend Lloyd Alexanders book series, from which this movie is based. I really wanted to like this, but it was pretty meh.; I was (and still am) a big fan of the books this movie is based on. Maybe that's part of the reason why I was kind of unimpressed by it. It had some good moments - the skeletal warriors were done up in a pretty cool manner, and the scene where Hen Wen is captured is rather well-done. I thought the voice acting was pretty good, for Dallben and Taran in particular. I think one major drawback of the film is that it tries to take a story that feels like a medieval legend and turn it into a typical fairytale. The animation of Doli and the Fair Folk is a prime example of this - they're turned into cute little fairies, almost like non- blue Smurfs with wings, complete with adorable child fairies - rather than the more classic kind of fair folk as being more like elves, dwarfs, or more naturalistic beings like dryads and the like. Gurgi got similar treatment. It kept Eilonwy's fiery temperament, but only at the beginning - by the end, she was just another damsel in distress relying on Taran (who, in the books, is kind of an idiot and always being told so) to pull them out of trouble. The scene in the Marshes of Morva was particularly disappointing, turning three very interesting and creepy characters into cartoonish, silly witches who somehow know of the heroes plans even though the heroes never spoke to them about it. The replacement of Arawn with the Horned King, who's done up like some kind of demonic living skeleton, is also disappointing - I guess just having a really evil guy was not good enough? They also left out major characters and plot points. Other drawbacks include sometimes-shoddy animation, and many overly drawn-out \"adventure\" scenes - chases around the evil castle, the wondrous but somehow boring discovery of magical fairy magicalness, the cauldron takes like 15 min or something to actually be destroyed, even them fleeing in a boat feels painfully slow. All in all, this movie has a few nice points and isn't super terrible, but it's also not particularly interesting. A bit disappointing; This was one of the few Disney flix I had yet to see. I read all 5 Lloyd  Alexander stories about Taryn, and I was a bit let-down by the movie  version. The plot was altered a lot, and some of the key elements that had  me riveted to the book were gone. The movie was a little intense for  younger viewers I felt, but the plot butchery aside, the movie can stand on  its own, albeit wobbly. I'd love to see more of the intense imagery shown  here (Hunchback of Notre Dame is my favorite Disney). Rent it? Yes Buy it? Ehh...rent it first. Not suitable for small children but REALLY COOL; I saw this movie well, the Dutch version in the cinema when I was 4, and ran out crying. Quite at the beginning as well... Now, 15 years later, I've seen it again, and I loved it. As I like fantasy, this film was right up my street. I later read the books by Lloyd Alexander, and Disney messed things up a little bit, but that's okay, they did the best they could. Problem is that it's not suitable for little children. Something you'd not expect from Disney. The Horned King is, with his appearance and his frightful dragons, maybe a bit too frightening for little children, and the plot takes a unexpected? maybe.. turn and that might not be good for little children to see, as that's really scary. Don't expect Disney-sing-a-longs, but a cool story and a real villain. If you like fantasy, you'll like this!  Under rated; I'm shocked by some of the ratings given to this movie. It is dark but so many of the great Disney classics are. I would have given this movie ten stars but it should of been longer to showcase the many amazing events that I cannot describe do to spoilers. If you like Ghibli I think you would enjoy this. I am writing this as I am watching the great mouse detective with my daughter. This movie Received a 9 star rating but is as dark as the black cauldron in my opinion. Although my 5 year old daughter disagrees. (But my 9 year old niece agrees.) I am writing as a father that has seen a lot of kids movies. Pretty to look at, but so, so boring to watch; The Black Cauldron is a far cry from most films of Disney's dark period (1961-1988) in terms of aesthetics. It is a beautiful film to look at with its dark fantasy world, appealing character designs, good score and lush backgrounds that remind me of the detailed backgrounds for Sleeping Beauty. And that is about all the good I can say about this film, which is a dreadfully boring narrative mess. The plot has little direction to begin with. There is no focus or clear goal to propel the story forward. None of the characters are interesting. Taran might be the weakest of Disney's animated leading men, having virtually no personality traits other than his cockiness and desire to be a great warrior. Love interest Princess Eilonwy is the same. Fflewddur is mildly entertaining comic relief, but aside from that he serves little purpose and could have been cut from the film with no consequence. Gurgi is to this film what Jar Jar Binks was to the Star Wars prequels. There are pathetic attempts at character development, but Taran and Gurgi's arcs are so weak that they leave little impact. The Horned King could have been an awesome villain, but he barely DOES anything, leaving most of his work to the ever annoying Creeper, who manages to liposuction all the coolness from the Horned King's scenes. I doubt I'll be watching this again anytime soon. It's looks are nice, but the story and characters are not emotionally resonant enough to make the whole product memorable. It's sad, because I love it when Disney delves into dark territory. Such a shame. Disney's failed attempt at changing direction; The 80s is known for its dark films. And even Disney films of the time are no exception. Their art style is muted, using heavy shadows, stark contrasts and swaying away from the cartoony colours. Their story lines are rather adult and depressing. Well, in comparison at least. And the crowning achievement of this is none other than The Black Cauldron, the most peculiar of the Disney canon films. At the time Disney Animation Studios were not doing so well. In fact the company was seriously considering closing them down and focusing solely on theme parks and merchandise. This movie was originally meant to change that course, but it almost ended up being the sole thing to ruin the whole studio. It wanted to take Disney to a whole different direction, picking as its source material a dark fantasy novel and staying very faithful to its tone, earning the PG rating. And yes, before you ask, the pig is in the book as well. Disney didn't add that to give the movie a mascot. Gurgi is in the book as well. I'm never reading that book, no matter how much you'd pay me. So what went wrong? Well, what didn't. The Black Cauldron is a mess. It was a major flop upon its release, and I can definitely see why. It has since garnered a cult following, but the fact still remains that it simply isn't a Disney film. Families went in expecting a typical Disney experience with fairytale stories, kid friendly messages and all around merriment. Instead they were treated to a medieval fantasy story leaning heavily towards dark and horror. But, that could be forgiven. I actually somewhat like the idea in principle. Great heroics, one scary villain, myths and legends, sword and sorcery, all done by one of the greatest animation studios on Earth. What's not to like? How about the fact that the main character is an unlikable, lazy jerk, the side characters have no, you know, character, the plot wanders around worse than a drunken minstrel, the end twist is unimaginably disappointing, the MacGuffin pig is ludicrous, the villain while certainly scary has no charisma or presence beyond looking like the devil and as a whole I'm simply not feeling the epicness. It's clear Disney had never done anything like this, and had no idea how to adapt to a different kind of storytelling tone. A dark fantasy story differs greatly from fairy tales, though they both certainly utilize the same character tropes and source materials. But whereas fairy tales are about morals and simple lessons about good and evil, dark fantasy is more about the struggle against eternal darkness, the meaning of hope in the midst of despair and about guts and glory. I don't get that from The Black Cauldron. The movie has its upsides, definitely. It looks great, the villain is certainly the scariest Disney has ever done and about one third of the story is actually pretty captivating. But it has flaws, many many flaws. Not my personal favourite, but you should still check it out to see if it speaks to you. An unconventional Disney animated film.; The Black Cauldron is a Disney film that is not based on a well-known fairytale nor is it an original Disney story. Instead, it is based on a novel by Lloyd Alexander, a story about pig-keeper Taran who attempts to find his future-foretelling pig so that the evil Horned King would not capture and use her to pinpoint the whereabouts of the Black Cauldron. The Horned King plans to use the Black Cauldron to spread untold evil and power. The film has splendid hand-drawn animation and a catchy music score. Also, the plot has steady pacing to it with some adventurous and exciting action scenes, and the villainous Horned King is also one of the more scarier-looking Disney villains out there. However, I thought much of the characters lacked any development or chemistry, particular that of Taran. He wants to experience more in his life than just settling as a pig-keeper, but his purpose and goals were not fully developed throughout the rest of the film. He also didn't have any chemistry with the heroine, Princess Eilonwy, whose purpose in the movie was also very vague. She along with the wide range of characters including the flying trolls didn't contribute much to the plot; it was as if they were just placed in the movie for window dressing. But again, there are quite a few actions scenes that made the film at least somewhat exciting, and the sacrificing elements, lack of comedy, and dramatic characters made this a pretty dark and un-conventional Disney film. It's not one of my favorites, but is watchable at least once or twice. Grade C+ sad to say i had to hate it; i thought it was a good move-if you've never read the book!!! Disney has gone over the edge with this. i had seen the movie when i was little, and thought it was a good movie. and it is if you've never read the book. just a little while ago i heard about the books and decided i would read them. i was blown away by the books! they were so good. personally , i'm a big lotr movie fan, i liked them more the the lotr books.the lotr books were just a little to detailed for me, so this came in first. the animation was good, but the story was heartbreaking. they start off with a bad start, this little fat lively bald guy, who at first sight i thought \"this must be coll\" which i thought they didn't do to bad. THEN I HEAR IT'S DALLBEN!!! i was mortified, dallben was supposed to be an old enchanter who hardly ever got out of his seat. and the way henwen gave the prophicies was all wrong. but anyway they continued the bad going by cutting out lord gwydion. what the heck? so then it turns out that the enchantress's, ordu,orwen and ogroch, already have the black cauldron. so then eilyonwi comes in and one is some little girl who doesn't talk near enough. and the whole thing with the sword, it just wasn't right. anyway in conclusion i could not stand it. the books deserve so much more credit than they get. read the books if you think this movie is good. An AWESOME! Disney Fantasy; I really disagree that this film is in the \"Top Worst 5\" list on Keyframe. I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews, because I thought this film was AWESOME! And also I have read the \"Chronicles of Prydain\" book series too from which this film is based on; well actually book #2. I love Princess Eilonwy, she is beautiful, cute as button and a brave young woman; her kiss with Taran at the end knocked me for a loop. (*sigh*) You know, I thought she and Taran do make a cute couple in my books. Also, I love Gurgi too. He is SO cute and talks funny too. So anyway, this film is an awesome Disney fantasy. It didn't work...; Of all Disney's failures, none are quite so infamous as The Black Cauldron. Based off material that was in the talks for decades, it was a property that was whispered about around the Disney studios for quite a few years before its conception (Ollie Johnston was an especially great fan of The Chonicles of Prydain). When Disney finally put the rights to use, they pumped oodles of cash into what they hoped would be the harbinger of a new age of Disney animation, one of darker, more mature storytelling. Not a single Nine Old Men put an ounce of work into this (okay...so Milt Kahl did some preliminary character designs...) and it seemed to be the consumation of the arrival of the new guard of Disney animators. What went wrong? Well the studio made the disastrous choice of handing off sections of the film to individual teams without giving them any interaction between each other, leading to some odd continuity and a total lack of a compelling throughline. Secondly, ambitions for a darker film were rather bipolar, leading to some odd inclusions like graphic gore and partial nudity and unfortunate omissions like a number of fascinating Tim Burton designs which were jettisoned for being too twisted. It doesn't help that the animation looks floaty and bland, some of the weakest in any Disney film up to then, and that heavy cuts under Michael Eisner removed said gore and nudity, only adding to the disconnected nature of this film. They made a few interesting choices, like reviving multi-planing (a very good idea) and using widescreen for the first time since Sleeping Beauty, but these don't make up for all the other blunders made by this film. The story is quite typical of Tolkien-inspired fantasy. An evil Sauron figure has returned to seek a magical item that will restore his power and send his armies across the land to conquer everything in existence. That item is a pig. I know, John Huston says he's seeking a cauldron, but he's actually trying to steal a magic pig from this film's Frodo Baggins, Taran, in order to find it. The one pig to rule them all. I'm not sure if that was in the book, and it's probably handled better in the book, but that's just a goofy sounding concept. Of course, our hero Taran, who's such a wimp that he's easily dispatched by the local goat (I know, that's what character development's for, right? right) loses the pig and has to go rescue him from the Horned King (who looks suspiciously like a demon from Night on Bald Mountain). Taran rescues the pig, but gets himself captured. With the help of a few fellow prisoners and a magic sword, he escapes, and it then becomes a quest to seek the Cauldron before the Horned King finds it. As animation, this is even more of a dark pit than The Fox and the Hound, which had a few real standout moments. There are no moments of excellence here, just floaty, weightless motion and an over-reliance on reaction shots that just looks awkward. Characters are thrown off-model in strange ways, and very little of the performances ring true. The backgrounds do have a nice atmosphere to them, but are also pretty smudgy. Design wise, very little stands out here, and I can't help but wish they'd incorporated things like Tim Burton's idea for flying hand monsters (not ripping off J.R. Tolkien enough?). The color design looks hollow and lacks any sort of warmth or emotion, as if drab colors were what was hip in the eighties (not that I blame them for thinking such). Lamentably, the best animation is Hendel Butoy and Andreas Deja's for Gurgie, a hapless character that they nevertheless lend some much needed life to. Otherwise, I can only point to The Secret of NIMH, made for less than half the money, and sigh at how the biggest animation studio in the world could have made a film that looked one-tenth as good. Not that Bluth hasn't made the mistake of failing to smell a bad concept, but even he must have gotten bad vibes from what Disney was about to do. One has to wonder how a studio with so much riding on this film could have gotten it so wrong. The failure very nearly drove Disney into folding its animation company, and so many potentially lucrative animators were driven into better careers elsewhere. It's a shame, but, thankfully, Disney did hold on to make a few more films. What's more, their very next project would be honest-to-god decent. It's a shame we didn't see a solid genre picture from this studio, though. We can only look at the disastrous final product and wonder what could have been. cutesy rewrite shocks readers of the book; harmless enough, but it lets the cat out of the bag: Hollywood scriptwriters only pretend to study literature on their way to the big bucks. Otherwise they'd have known the dollops of Disney cute that are larded over characters of ambiguous appeal could only choke the message. To Disney, the Ugly Duckling is a cuddly pet. An echo of some greater work is here, though, in the classical score. BLAH! And YUCK!; OY! Is this a stinker of a movie! I'm telling ya...I don't know how I missed  this movie in 1985 but I'm kind of glad I did! I had heard really great  things about it and was really looking forward to watching it. Well I  rented it... BLAH! It was a major disappointment! First I guess the Horn  King looks scary but then Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty was more so. And  I'm sorry but I felt no chemistry between the pig boy and the Princess.  I  have to say this is on of the few Disney movies where I think they totally  missed their mark. Off the Beaten Path for Disney; The Black Cauldron follows the quest of a young pigkeeper's apprentice to prevent the evil Horned King from unleashing the power of the black cauldron and effacing all life from the world. Surprisingly dark for a Disney movie, it offers more than the usual amount of frightening scenes, violence, and even some sexual innuendo (which is sure to pass over the head of young viewers). Luckily, it also features a cast of memorable characters -- the lovable, despicable, and comical -- that carry the magical Tolkien-esquire story through to the end. Imaginative animation, excellent voice work and a great orchestral score help to make The Black Cauldron a classic, albeit an under-appreciated one. Recommended, though it may be too scary for very young children. A Disney Departure; \"The Black Cauldron\" is not a typical Disney animated feature.  For one thing, it's not a G-rated musical.  In fact, it was the first-ever Disney feature to receive a PG rating.  The story comes from the works of Lloyd Alexander, in the spirit of J.R.R. Tolkien.  In it, Taran, a young pig-keeper must protect Henwen, a prophetic pig who can divine the whereabouts of a powerful weapon known as the Black Cauldron.  The demonic Horned King is after this bastion of black magic to create an invincible army of the undead.  This movie boasts impressive art shot in 70mm widescreen format, art which includes the contributions of a young Tim Burton.  Sadly, this feature did poorly in theaters, possibly being too frightening, or going over the heads of Disney's usual target audience.  Just the same, \"The Black Cauldron\" deserves a good look! The Fifth Element; This film fell under three of my \"to-view-or-review\" lists: Disney Phase II efforts, 80s fantasy, and 80s animation.  (Yes, I enjoy 80s culture.)  Fantasy films like this run on four theme elements: good, evil, design and differentiations.  The fifth element is trickier, the public reception to the constructed universe. Spoilers exist... The first and second run on stereotypes--the page warrior, the virginal princess, the Dark Lord.  The Villian design is from 'Heavy Metal'-style TV cartoons.  The witches are French stereotypes: how else do you explain the red hair, appetite for frogs, and power scheming?  The minstrel is the play-within element, the actor playing the actor.  Gurgi is the Jew/Russian stand-in. Disney's images come from past work--'Fantasia', 'Beauty', 'Dalmatians'.  Interestingly, Disney tries to make everything appear normal in our distinct Western configuration while Scott wanted 'Legend' to be hyperreal and hyperbole--just look at Darkness.  By comparison, the Horned King is Emperor Palpatine, plain. 'Conan' shifted our interpretation of the first element, 'Legend' mastered the third and 'Dragonslayer' emphasized the fourth (the most daring so far).  The biggest differentiations here come in lesser details.  The dragons, the skeletons, and the atmosphere we've seen before, but to lesser effect.  I noticed in 'Mulan' how Disney kept from showing war-dead, lest they spoil the happy mood they spent years perfecting.  According to IMDb trivia, Katzenberg censored this upon release, probably wrecking the more mature content.  He then decided to make his own version with 'Shrek' after defecting.  Meanwhile, Peter Jackson decided that since he has $300 million to blow, he wants everything.  So he turns elves and orcs into Aryans (either physically or philosophically) and all Gollum's mannerisms stem from Gurgi.  Some things don't change... Overall, this is not as complex as 'Wizards'.  Not as visual as 'Legend'.  Not as world-weary as 'Dragonslayer' (which had no comic relief).  We didn't want this foreign theme in our pop culture ideas--mostly sentimental--of what Disney movies are supposed to be (the same fate befell the 'Oz' sequel) so this has historical significance in charting Disney's retreat to Phase III formula. Bernstein copies his 'Ghostbusters' compilation for the score. Final Analysis = = Midrange Material Read the books instead; I don't even understand what the film-makers were *trying* to do with this. As an adaptation of Lloyd Alexander's excellent series, it's almost unrecognizable. When Taran draws a generic 'magic sword' in Spiral Castle, when Gurgi sacrifices himself to destroy the Black Cauldron, when the three witches perform a resurrection spell, when Eilonwy is reduced to weak love interest and Fflewddur to comic relief, it's clear that the writers have missed the point entirely. Nor is it worthwhile considered simply as a film in its own right; it's Disney at its most self-parodying, filled with tired shtick and cheap emotional manipulation. The animation and music are dull and only a couple of the voice actors provide bright spots. Avoid. Not for Kids; I watched this movie expecting a movie for children but a while in I had to notice that it is not at all suitable for children under the age of 6 or even 10. Other than Bambi for example the unsuitable content isn't limited to one scene but is pulled through half of the movie beginning with the body and ending with the movie. The beginning is cute and the characters are nice and funny but now and then you feel a bit freaked out by some situations. The tension is built up in the body and explodes in the final leaving young minds exposed to the spooky action terror drama set up at the end. If I had seen this movie at primary school age I'd be traumatized and I would have the permanent fear of losing someone. To put it in a nutshell for me it was a big mistake and I am desperately disappointed in Disney. Disney rewrite of \"The Lord of the Rings\"; So many striking similarities between Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and The Black Cauldron: A magical item, the black cauldron/the ring, granting excessive power. A wise wizard initiating an unexperienced lad. Cute companions to follow the lad. Flying black dragons vs. dark riders. A prophetic pig vs. a crystal ball. But as that, a twisted copy of something much larger, it was not very exciting nor does it have much depth, and it's not cute and funny either. My wife and I turned off after 20 minutes although we were looking forward to this Disney movie. Ten screenwriters = abomination; If you've read the books, this movie is a wretched butchering of Mr. Alexander's work.  If you haven't read the books, gently put this awful movie away and read the books instead.  They're by Lloyd Alexander and any library will have them.  Two of the five books received Newberry Awards (for excellence in children's literature) It is possible to change a book and still have a great movie - witness The Shining or The Lord of the Rings.  This film, with its TEN screenwriters, is a testament to just how awful an adaptation can be. Very disappointing; I watched this movie for the first time today, and was very disappointed. I had been told that it was notoriously scary for a Disney movie, and I can see how children would find it frightening. However, this was not the problem I had with it. I found it to be extremely boring. The plot and characters were both generic and underdeveloped, and I found little suspense, humour, or really anything positive about it. I can possibly see young boys being amused with the action and pure evil of the Horned King, but unlike most Disney movies, there is little appeal for older viewers looking for a decent story. I'm not going to say this is an absolutely horrible movie - it's not. But it is very bland, and very forgettable. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. May Be Disappointing For Some But Actually Pretty Good; I should state that I am a massive Prydain Chronicles fan. Naturally, when I heard there was a movie I of course had to check it out. After my dad finished reading me the books he rented the movie for me. My 7-year-old self knew that the movie wouldn't be exactly like the books due to time constraints and that it was only based on the first two books anyway, but the only similarity between this film and the books is the character's names. For one thing, there are tons of characters missing such as Coll and Gwydion, and the characters that do make it in are virtually unrecognizable. For example, Taran should have had black hair, both Eilonwy and Doli should have had red hair, and Fflewddur should have had blond hair. But these are all minor differences compared to some others. Dallben and Coll are also combined into one. If you read the books, Dallben is essentially Merlin in all but name while Coll is the pig keeper that Taran is apprenticed to. Also, the gwythaints are birds in the books but here are dragons for some reason. Lord Arawn isn't looking for the Black Cauldron but already has it. Gurgi is the same for the most part though I imagined him to be a bit taller. Also I found Creeper annoying, not like his powerfully imposing master. But how does it fare on its own? Well, there are definitely some good aspects. For one thing, the animation, while not the best I've seen, is very detailed, especially on the Horned King. Also, I like the fact that there are no songs. Nothing against musicals (there are some really good ones like Little Shop Of Horrors, Rocky Horror Picture Show, and Mary Poppins), but it feels like every other animated movie has musical numbers and quite frankly it gets kind of tiresome. But the best thing about the movie by far is the Horned King, who reminds me a bit of Cyvus Vail for some reason. While he may not be particularly action-oriented, he has a very imposing presence and a truly amazing voice (I must confess that until I went on IMDb I thought they just followed around some 90-year-old man with a mic). Conclusion: A surprisingly enjoyable and entertaining movie with a truly fascinating villain. Some fans of the books (which I am one of) might be disappointed but I found myself liking it. The Black Cauldron; I saw a short trailer for this cartoon from Walt Disney Pictures, and then I read the interesting trivia that Tim Burton worked as conceptual artist on this film before becoming a successful filmmaker, so I was definitely looking forward to watching it. Basically centuries ago in the land of Prydain, young man Taran (Grant Bardsley) one day dreams of becoming a great warrior, his enchanter master Dallben (Freddie Jones) tells him the secret of why he is assistant pig keeper, Hen Wen is an oracular pig, and holds the secret to the location of the Black Cauldron, which has the power to restore life to the dead, undead souls of course. The boy is forced to go on a journey to save Hen Wen when the pig is kidnapped by the evil skeletal lord The Horned King (John Hurt), who plans to use the power of the Black Cauldron to raise a large army of unstoppable undead slaves and soldiers to take over the world, and the fearsome lord has many minions to stop any intruders who try to get into the castle. Taran is joined in his quest by furry creature companion Gurgi (John Byner) who is small and pestering but reliable, comical middle-aged bard Fflewddur Fflam (Nigel Hawthorne) who tries to help with his poetry and harp playing occasionally, and of course the beautiful Princess Eilonwy (Susan Sheridan) who is his age and stubborn but has bravery. Taran finds a magical sword that helps him fight off the enemies, they encounter the small fairy-like beings called the Fair Folk who help them to locate where the Black Cauldron is, they find the cauldron in the clutches of three witches, Orddu (Eda Reiss Merin), Orgoch (Billie Hayes) and Orwen (Adele Malis-Morey) who will only trade it for the magical sword. They reveal before disappearing that the cauldron is indestructible, and the only way to break it's power it is if someone was to climb into it, but this will also kill whoever does it, none of the companions are willing to do this, so the young man feels hopeless and that the mission may have all been for nothing, and then the nasty soldiers interrupt. They seize the Black Cauldron and The Horned King uses it to raise his army who pour out into the world, the friends are released by Gurgi who jumps into the cauldron himself before Taran can do, the spell of the cauldron is broken and the army collapses, the cauldron goes out of control and eventually consumes and destroys the castle. In the end the three witches take back the now useless cauldron, Fflewddur convinces them to prove their abilities and allow a trade, the cauldron to revive Gurgi, they hand back the magical sword and Gurgi is alive and well, the young man, Eilonwy and the bard journey home together, and Dallben praises Taran as a hero. Also starring Arthur Malet as King Eidilleg, John Byner as Doli and John Huston as Narrator. The mostly British voice cast is well chosen, Bardsley as the young hero, Jones as an enchanter, Hawthorne as an eccentric entertainer, Hurt as a dark villain, Huston giving his narration, and especially Byner who sounds very similar to The Lord of the Ring's Sméagol but is really lovable. You could argue that this cartoon film is like any standard story full of swords and sorcery, and you can tell the animation is perhaps not the same high quality as previous and of course later pictures, but there is no denying that it is a really enjoyable tale for all ages, a fun animated adventure. Good! Forgettable Disney feature.; Disney studios seemed to endure a lull of about 15 years, beginning in the early '70s with Robin Hood and lasting right through until (and beyond) 1985. The Black Cauldron is nowhere near vintage Disney, but it's not without certain merits. For one thing, the animation is mighty impressive and marked the beginning of dazzling technological advances in Disney's animated features. Also, the voice-overs are excellent (with John Hurt a particular stand-out, bringing real menace to The Horned King). However, the problem here is that the decidedly uninspired storytelling severely lets down the film. The story follows a young pig keeper as he tries to protect a magical pig from the forces of darkness. The pig has the power to tell the future when its face is dipped in a pool of water, and an evil Horned King seeks the creature in order to use its magical skill to locate a long-lost black cauldron. If the black cauldron ever falls into the hands of the Horned King, then he will become all-powerful and rule the land. You don't have to know much about the fantasy genre to realise that this is a thinly disguised retread of The Lord of the Rings. For the black cauldron, read \"the one true ring\". For the Horned King, read \"Sauron, the dark lord\". Indeed, it's no exaggeration to suggest that this film is a sort of Lord of the Rings substitute for those with only 80 minutes to spare. While the film is just about enjoyable enough (especially for kids) it doesn't aspire to the high quality of previous Disney classics. It also might seem mildly entertaining whilst on, but it fades out of the memory all too quickly afterwards. See The Black Cauldron if you're a Disney completist, but if you're looking for real quality stick with some of the old classics, like Dumbo and Lady and the Tramp. fine Disney fantasy; In the land of Prydain, Taran is the young assistant to Dallben. He doesn't understand why the pig Hen Wen is pampered. The evil Horned King is searching for the Black Cauldron which can create an invincible army of undead warriors. Hen Wen turns out to be an oracular pig who can reveal the location of the Black Cauldron. Dallben sends Taran away to hide with Hen Wen but the Horned King captures the pig. Taran is joined by pesky creature Gurgi in his rescue mission. Only he is captured and thrown into the dungeons where he joins Princess Eilonwy. They escape with bumbling bard Fflewddur Fflam. This is an old fashion Disney fantasy adventure with a little bit of CGI. The characters aren't that charismatic. They are out of a standard script with a young man, a feisty princess, a bumbling old fool and an animal sidekick. The pig is the one that keeps me scratching my head. I appreciate something unusual but it strikes me as very wrong. The old bard isn't as funny as he needs to be. I like Gurgi but I don't necessarily love him. This is fine but it is inferior to other Disney animated movies. A boy must save his country from an evil villain.; Without any doubt the scariest of all Disney-features, this film has some remarkably obvious Disney-traits. Among them are the funny bad-guys and the disturbing comic-relief scenes. The script-writers have obviously had trouble squeezing Alexander's characters in. Hen Wen is initially the main character of the movie: however, the cute little pig disappears half-way. Gurgi's role changes, and Eilonwy's bauble vanishes. The film is also cut in two: there are two great climaxes, and they sadly stand apart with the disappearance of HenWen. It is a nasty blemish on an otherwise very entertaining classic: no vexatious singing, but wonderful exiting background music. The animation on the dragons and landscapes is stunning, the looks of personae are well-designed, the suspense in some of the scenes is intense. It is definitely a film I enjoyed after the first time. A must for fantasy-lovers. Interesting...if you want to see Disney at its nadir.; This film is about a pig who apparently can help predict the future! Yep, and such an important porker is entrusted to a teen filled with hubris--but not much actual talent. And, if they are not successful, Skeletor will rule the world!!! The word 'nadir' is seldom used, but it's quite appropriate for this Disney film. It means the absolute lowest point--and in 1985 the Disney released this poor cartoon to almost universal disdain. After reportedly spending over a decade on the film, the end result was very poor for a full-length Disney film. And today, most would probably agree that it was their worst movie. So why is it a bad movie? Well, the most obvious is the poor animation which varies tremendously but is generally no better than a Saturday morning cartoon from the time. Second, the choice of stories was bizarre. I think Disney thought their old films were passé and tried using edgier material--but the story is really shallow and the characters completely uninteresting. In particular, Gurgi is sort of like a combination of Jar-Jar and Golem. As for the rest, they are one-dimensional and not particularly likable. The end result is dreadfully too dull--way too violent and confusing for kids and too dull and poorly made for adults. I can see why HUGE changes resulted at Disney as a result of this poor film.   \n",

       "      <td>Engaging film; This film is about a hunt for the murderer of a triad gang leader in Hong Kong. I thought \"Rebellion\" was just another low budget and senselessly violent film that the Hong Kong film industry likes to make. With very low expectations, I was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of \"Rebellion\". It has a very good script, as it keeps suspense and engagement up high. It focuses on \"who done it\", instead of focusing on violence and bloodshed. Through a series of mistrust and backstabbing, suspense and thrill is maintained well throughout. Another thing I like about the movie is that it gives each of the main character a distinct personality. The actors, especially Shawn Yue and Chapman To, convincingly portray their characters. Production, including camera work, lighting and sets are also above average. Coupled with the unexpected ending twist, I can safely conclude that \"Rebellion\" is an engaging and above par film from Hong Kong.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Haines in the Saddle; William Haines plays a brassy carnival barker who gets caught cheating 3 cowboys in a roulette game. His punishment is to work off the debt (after a carny girl steals his money) on a local ranch. Great concept and perfect for the Haines formula, but the film is flat in a couple places and needed a better director. The editing is also bad. But Haines is a delight as usual. His silly billy character made a smooth transition to talkies. Haines was one of the most appealing and popular stars of the late 20s and early 30s. Good cast here with pretty Leila Hyams the ranch owner, Cliff Edwards the hapless cowhand Trilby (whom Haines keeps calling Svengali), Polly Moran as Pansy the housekeeper, Ralph Bushman the lead cowboy, Charles Middleton the brother, Vera Marshe the carny girl, Jack Pennick as Pete, and Jay Wilsey and Buddy Roosevelt the other cowboys. Ann Dvorak is one of the carny dancers. Very odd but the carny girls wear the same cannibal outfits in their dance number as the dancers in the Free and Easy number from the 1930 film of the same name. And Dvorak was a dancer in THAT film as well (which starred Buster Keaton). MGM recycled the costumes! Minor Haines film and one credited as his first flop, but still interesting to see this once-major star in action. Your Entertainment Level Will Depend on Your Opinion of Haines; Way Out West (1930) ** 1/2 (out of 4) How much entertainment you get out of this Western spoof is certainly going to depend on your tolerance level of star William Haines. In the film he plays Windy, a carnival con man who rips off a bunch of cowboys who plan on killing him when they find out but instead they take him back to the ranch and put him to work. Of course, Windy causes one problem after another but before long the beautiful owner (Leila Hyams) begins to fall in love with him while her brother and the other cowboys continue to see him as a threat. The more pictures I see from Haines the more I realize that everyone of them are pretty much the same with just the settings changed. As you'd expect, Haines plays a fast-talking, sexist, at times mean-spirited clown who is so out of it that you honestly can't look at him as a human. This is the type of character that Haines would play throughout his career and if you can put up with the style of comedy then you have to admit that he's pretty good at it. I wouldn't say I'm a die-hard fan of Haines but I always find it somewhat amusing how far he's willing to go to try and capture a laugh. At times it's in terms of some sort of physical slapstick while at other times it's just him being downright obnoxious and rude. Of course, I think we'd all ask how any beautiful woman would fall for his type of character but it happened in each one of these MGM features. I was really impressed with the supporting cast as well. Hyams is extremely fun to watch as the sexy ranch owner and she manges to have quite a bit of chemistry with Hyams. Cliff Edwards and Francis X. Bushman, Jr. both have nice supporting parts as does Polly Moran. At just 70-minutes the film has a pretty good pace from start to finish as well as some nice laughs along the way. There's even a nice fist-fight at the end of the movie to cap everything off. WAY OUT WEST certainly isn't a classic but for fans of Haines they should enjoy it. Smart Aleck; The story of William Haines and his fall from Hollywood stardom is pretty well known. Popular in the silent era where his smart aleck all American type of character did well, Haines did not survive the transition to sound well even before the gay scandal decked his career for good. Way Out West is an example of this. In Way Out West Haines is a carnival barker who rooks some cowboys out of their dough with a crooked wheel. The cowboys almost hang him, but instead are persuaded to take him back to the ranch and let him work out the $200.00 or so that cheated them out of. Of course being a city slicker he does not take to ranch life with the usual gags that follow. They are the best part of Way Out West. But for the life of me I can't see why ranch owner Leila Hyams falls for Haines, especially when she has good old reliable Ralph Bushman around with whom she has a lot more in common. The film made little sense to me in that vein. Charles Middleton is Hyams righteous brother and Cliff Edwards plays a sidekick role and even sings a forgettable ballad. Way Out West turned out to be the direction down for the career of William Haines. Horse Sense for Haines; In Arizona, wisecracking carnival showman William Haines (as Windy) uses leggy women to lure local cowboys into his boudoir, where he wins over $200 from them with a rigged roulette wheel. Mr. Haines wants to use the money to go to Chicago and sell life insurance, but loses it to pick-pocket Vera Marshe (as \"La Belle Rosa\"). When the men discover they've been had, they attempt to lynch Haines then make him work off the money on a ranch. Roughed up but retaining his good humor, Haines falls head-over-heels for pretty ranch owner Leila Hyams (as Molly Rankin). But rowdy Ralph Bushman (as Steve), son of silent legend Francis X. Bushman, wants Ms. Hyams too. Ukulele playing singer Cliff Edwards (as Trilby) and comedienne Polly Moran (as Pansy) lend support. \"Way Out West\" was a noticeably uneven entry from the superstar, appearing careless at times. **** Way Out West (8/2/30) Fred Niblo ~ William Haines, Leila Hyams, Cliff Edwards, Polly Moran A lousy old Western; Other than the novelty of seeing a very effeminate performance from leading man William Haines, there isn't much to recommend this picture. It seems that despite the fact that Haines was a major silent star, in the sound age he was given crappy roles. I read a book (\"The Leading Men of MGM\" by Jane Ellen Wayne) that discussed leading men of the day and the author indicated that studio head, Louis B. Mayer did not like gay actors and so Haines, despite his great popularity, was given rotten films in order to destroy his career. I can't say for a fact that this is true, as the book seemed VERY scandalous and dished a lot of dirt, but based on this film, I tend to believe the author in this case. This isn't even good enough to be considered a B-movie! The writing is pretty terrible and clichéd, the action generally pretty cheesy and the whole idea of a stereotypically gay man trying to win a woman's love just seemed silly. An interesting curio, perhaps, but NOT a good film. Enjoyable Haines performance...film is more than just a curio...; WAY OUT WEST is a film designed to be a star vehicle for the controversial WILLIAM HAINES, who was during this time an outspoken gay member of the Hollywood community. He was a talented charmer, capable of natural performances rather than the standard overacting typical of many a silent screen star. While the film itself may not be a winner, it's entertaining enough to keep you watching until the happy ending. Haines plays a carnival worker whose crooked ways lead to his capture by a bunch of cowboy roughs who want him to work off his debt to them by doing chores as a farmhand. FRANCIS X. BUSHMAN is one of the guys, POLLY MORAN makes a winsome female, and CLIFF EDWARDS has an innocuous supporting role. It's strictly standard stuff but interesting to watch Haines at work, creating a character you can't help but like despite his sordid reputation (in the film). Rumor has it that his being openly gay ruined his career in up tight Hollywood when morality clauses were enforced rather harshly. Summing up: Definitely worth a look. Way Out West With William Haines; Although he's all but forgotten now, in 1930, Hollywood's first full year of talkie films, William Haines was king of the box office. His movies - he starred in three of them -  made more money than those of any other male star. WAY OUT WEST is one of those films. Haines plays a carnival shyster who cheats some cowboys out of their money with a crooked roulette wheel. They retaliate by kidnapping him, taking him back to their ranch and forcing him to work off the debt. There are some of the usual silly-billy antics you expect from a Bill Haines film. But there are also lapses into very serious areas as well. The look on Haines' bleeding face after he's been roughed-up by a big cowboy, without a word spoken, speaks volumes. Also appearing are Leila Hyams, one of MGM's pretty starlets of the early 1930's; Francis X. Bushman, Jr.; the ubiquitous Polly Moran; and little Cliff Edwards, who gets to play his ukulele &amp; sing. Leila Hyams - MGM's Perfect Leading Lady!!!; Leila Hyams was MGM's perfect leading lady. She had a patrician beauty but a very unaggressive personality so she seemed to fit into any genre. She was paired well with Chester Morris in the powerful \"The Big House\" and again in the zippy pre-code comedy \"Red Headed Woman\". Only once did she show a spark of some hidden emotion - that was when she played the carnival girl in \"Freaks\" but whenever John Gilbert looked at her with intensity or William Haines wisecracked, there she was, unobtrusive and behaving like a perfect leading lady. The main reason I bought this DVD was to hear Cliff \"Ukelele Ike\" Edwards sing \"Singing a Song to the Stars\" and even though he didn't get much of a chance to shine in this movie, I can guarantee that listening to his glorious falsetto will send shivers up your spine. Windy (Haines) is a carnival barker (that's Ann Dvorak on the far left of the dancers) who also doubles as a gambling shyster. He bites off more than he can chew when he steal from a bunch of cowboys who promptly drag him to the nearest tree. He is saved by Buck (Charles Middleton \"Ming the Merciless\") who suggests that he work off what he stole from the cowboys by working on his shorthanded ranch. He doesn't get off to a good start - flirting with the \"help\", Molly (Hyams) who just happens to be the boss!!! Most of the movie seems to be centered on the tricks the cowboys play on Windy to bring him down a peg or two - like the old \"putting him on a docile horse that just happens to be unrideable\" and sending him into town for food which means gathering hay for the cows!! It doesn't really pick up pace until the end when Molly is bitten by a snake and Windy puts the fainting maiden into the car to travel to the Indian doctor. Pansy (Polly Moran) the cook, mistakes what she sees as a kidnapping and sends all the cowboys out for Windy's blood!! If this was the best that MGM could come up with for one of their top stars (Haines) there might be a case for studio sabotage - on top of that there seemed to be some decidedly off colour jokes (mistaking him for the cook \"Pansy\") and name calling all at Haine's expense. Cliff Edwards as Trilby has less to do in this movie than any I have seen him in. Among the cowboys, a couple, Buddy Roosevelt and Jay Wilsey were soon to become regulars on the Gower Gulch circuit!!</td>\n",

for the murderer of a triad gang leader in Hong Kong. I thought \"Rebellion\" was just another low budget and senselessly violent film that the Hong Kong film industry likes to make. With very low expectations, I was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of \"Rebellion\". It has a very good script, as it keeps suspense and engagement up high. It focuses on \"who done it\", instead of focusing on violence and bloodshed. Through a series of mistrust and backstabbing, suspense and thrill is maintained well throughout. Another thing I like about the movie is that it gives each of the main character a distinct personality. The actors, especially Shawn Yue and Chapman To, convincingly portray their characters. Production, including camera work, lighting and sets are also above average. Coupled with the unexpected ending twist, I can safely conclude that \"Rebellion\" is an engaging and above par film from Hong Kong.   \n",
       "5111  Haines in the Saddle; William Haines plays a brassy carnival barker who gets caught cheating 3 cowboys in a roulette game. His punishment is to work off the debt (after a carny girl steals his money) on a local ranch. Great concept and perfect for the Haines formula, but the film is flat in a couple places and needed a better director. The editing is also bad. But Haines is a delight as usual. His silly billy character made a smooth transition to talkies. Haines was one of the most appealing and popular stars of the late 20s and early 30s. Good cast here with pretty Leila Hyams the ranch owner, Cliff Edwards the hapless cowhand Trilby (whom Haines keeps calling Svengali), Polly Moran as Pansy the housekeeper, Ralph Bushman the lead cowboy, Charles Middleton the brother, Vera Marshe the carny girl, Jack Pennick as Pete, and Jay Wilsey and Buddy Roosevelt the other cowboys. Ann Dvorak is one of the carny dancers. Very odd but the carny girls wear the same cannibal outfits in their dance number as the dancers in the Free and Easy number from the 1930 film of the same name. And Dvorak was a dancer in THAT film as well (which starred Buster Keaton). MGM recycled the costumes! Minor Haines film and one credited as his first flop, but still interesting to see this once-major star in action. Your Entertainment Level Will Depend on Your Opinion of Haines; Way Out West (1930) ** 1/2 (out of 4) How much entertainment you get out of this Western spoof is certainly going to depend on your tolerance level of star William Haines. In the film he plays Windy, a carnival con man who rips off a bunch of cowboys who plan on killing him when they find out but instead they take him back to the ranch and put him to work. Of course, Windy causes one problem after another but before long the beautiful owner (Leila Hyams) begins to fall in love with him while her brother and the other cowboys continue to see him as a threat. The more pictures I see from Haines the more I realize that everyone of them are pretty much the same with just the settings changed. As you'd expect, Haines plays a fast-talking, sexist, at times mean-spirited clown who is so out of it that you honestly can't look at him as a human. This is the type of character that Haines would play throughout his career and if you can put up with the style of comedy then you have to admit that he's pretty good at it. I wouldn't say I'm a die-hard fan of Haines but I always find it somewhat amusing how far he's willing to go to try and capture a laugh. At times it's in terms of some sort of physical slapstick while at other times it's just him being downright obnoxious and rude. Of course, I think we'd all ask how any beautiful woman would fall for his type of character but it happened in each one of these MGM features. I was really impressed with the supporting cast as well. Hyams is extremely fun to watch as the sexy ranch owner and she manges to have quite a bit of chemistry with Hyams. Cliff Edwards and Francis X. Bushman, Jr. both have nice supporting parts as does Polly Moran. At just 70-minutes the film has a pretty good pace from start to finish as well as some nice laughs along the way. There's even a nice fist-fight at the end of the movie to cap everything off. WAY OUT WEST certainly isn't a classic but for fans of Haines they should enjoy it. Smart Aleck; The story of William Haines and his fall from Hollywood stardom is pretty well known. Popular in the silent era where his smart aleck all American type of character did well, Haines did not survive the transition to sound well even before the gay scandal decked his career for good. Way Out West is an example of this. In Way Out West Haines is a carnival barker who rooks some cowboys out of their dough with a crooked wheel. The cowboys almost hang him, but instead are persuaded to take him back to the ranch and let him work out the $200.00 or so that cheated them out of. Of course being a city slicker he does not take to ranch life with the usual gags that follow. They are the best part of Way Out West. But for the life of me I can't see why ranch owner Leila Hyams falls for Haines, especially when she has good old reliable Ralph Bushman around with whom she has a lot more in common. The film made little sense to me in that vein. Charles Middleton is Hyams righteous brother and Cliff Edwards plays a sidekick role and even sings a forgettable ballad. Way Out West turned out to be the direction down for the career of William Haines. Horse Sense for Haines; In Arizona, wisecracking carnival showman William Haines (as Windy) uses leggy women to lure local cowboys into his boudoir, where he wins over $200 from them with a rigged roulette wheel. Mr. Haines wants to use the money to go to Chicago and sell life insurance, but loses it to pick-pocket Vera Marshe (as \"La Belle Rosa\"). When the men discover they've been had, they attempt to lynch Haines then make him work off the money on a ranch. Roughed up but retaining his good humor, Haines falls head-over-heels for pretty ranch owner Leila Hyams (as Molly Rankin). But rowdy Ralph Bushman (as Steve), son of silent legend Francis X. Bushman, wants Ms. Hyams too. Ukulele playing singer Cliff Edwards (as Trilby) and comedienne Polly Moran (as Pansy) lend support. \"Way Out West\" was a noticeably uneven entry from the superstar, appearing careless at times. **** Way Out West (8/2/30) Fred Niblo ~ William Haines, Leila Hyams, Cliff Edwards, Polly Moran A lousy old Western; Other than the novelty of seeing a very effeminate performance from leading man William Haines, there isn't much to recommend this picture. It seems that despite the fact that Haines was a major silent star, in the sound age he was given crappy roles. I read a book (\"The Leading Men of MGM\" by Jane Ellen Wayne) that discussed leading men of the day and the author indicated that studio head, Louis B. Mayer did not like gay actors and so Haines, despite his great popularity, was given rotten films in order to destroy his career. I can't say for a fact that this is true, as the book seemed VERY scandalous and dished a lot of dirt, but based on this film, I tend to believe the author in this case. This isn't even good enough to be considered a B-movie! The writing is pretty terrible and clichéd, the action generally pretty cheesy and the whole idea of a stereotypically gay man trying to win a woman's love just seemed silly. An interesting curio, perhaps, but NOT a good film. Enjoyable Haines performance...film is more than just a curio...; WAY OUT WEST is a film designed to be a star vehicle for the controversial WILLIAM HAINES, who was during this time an outspoken gay member of the Hollywood community. He was a talented charmer, capable of natural performances rather than the standard overacting typical of many a silent screen star. While the film itself may not be a winner, it's entertaining enough to keep you watching until the happy ending. Haines plays a carnival worker whose crooked ways lead to his capture by a bunch of cowboy roughs who want him to work off his debt to them by doing chores as a farmhand. FRANCIS X. BUSHMAN is one of the guys, POLLY MORAN makes a winsome female, and CLIFF EDWARDS has an innocuous supporting role. It's strictly standard stuff but interesting to watch Haines at work, creating a character you can't help but like despite his sordid reputation (in the film). Rumor has it that his being openly gay ruined his career in up tight Hollywood when morality clauses were enforced rather harshly. Summing up: Definitely worth a look. Way Out West With William Haines; Although he's all but forgotten now, in 1930, Hollywood's first full year of talkie films, William Haines was king of the box office. His movies - he starred in three of them -  made more money than those of any other male star. WAY OUT WEST is one of those films. Haines plays a carnival shyster who cheats some cowboys out of their money with a crooked roulette wheel. They retaliate by kidnapping him, taking him back to their ranch and forcing him to work off the debt. There are some of the usual silly-billy antics you expect from a Bill Haines film. But there are also lapses into very serious areas as well. The look on Haines' bleeding face after he's been roughed-up by a big cowboy, without a word spoken, speaks volumes. Also appearing are Leila Hyams, one of MGM's pretty starlets of the early 1930's; Francis X. Bushman, Jr.; the ubiquitous Polly Moran; and little Cliff Edwards, who gets to play his ukulele & sing. Leila Hyams - MGM's Perfect Leading Lady!!!; Leila Hyams was MGM's perfect leading lady. She had a patrician beauty but a very unaggressive personality so she seemed to fit into any genre. She was paired well with Chester Morris in the powerful \"The Big House\" and again in the zippy pre-code comedy \"Red Headed Woman\". Only once did she show a spark of some hidden emotion - that was when she played the carnival girl in \"Freaks\" but whenever John Gilbert looked at her with intensity or William Haines wisecracked, there she was, unobtrusive and behaving like a perfect leading lady. The main reason I bought this DVD was to hear Cliff \"Ukelele Ike\" Edwards sing \"Singing a Song to the Stars\" and even though he didn't get much of a chance to shine in this movie, I can guarantee that listening to his glorious falsetto will send shivers up your spine. Windy (Haines) is a carnival barker (that's Ann Dvorak on the far left of the dancers) who also doubles as a gambling shyster. He bites off more than he can chew when he steal from a bunch of cowboys who promptly drag him to the nearest tree. He is saved by Buck (Charles Middleton \"Ming the Merciless\") who suggests that he work off what he stole from the cowboys by working on his shorthanded ranch. He doesn't get off to a good start - flirting with the \"help\", Molly (Hyams) who just happens to be the boss!!! Most of the movie seems to be centered on the tricks the cowboys play on Windy to bring him down a peg or two - like the old \"putting him on a docile horse that just happens to be unrideable\" and sending him into town for food which means gathering hay for the cows!! It doesn't really pick up pace until the end when Molly is bitten by a snake and Windy puts the fainting maiden into the car to travel to the Indian doctor. Pansy (Polly Moran) the cook, mistakes what she sees as a kidnapping and sends all the cowboys out for Windy's blood!! If this was the best that MGM could come up with for one of their top stars (Haines) there might be a case for studio sabotage - on top of that there seemed to be some decidedly off colour jokes (mistaking him for the cook \"Pansy\") and name calling all at Haine's expense. Cliff Edwards as Trilby has less to do in this movie than any I have seen him in. Among the cowboys, a couple, Buddy Roosevelt and Jay Wilsey were soon to become regulars on the Gower Gulch circuit!!   \n",
