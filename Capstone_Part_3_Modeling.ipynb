       "      <td>Best Film of the 's!; That film has made its first success with the most beloved buddy picture of all time! The Next Who Framed Roger Rabbit I love how they try to make something different with CGI, because all they've done in the beginning were commercials and shorts. Ever since John Lasseter saw Tron, he knew that CGI would go all over the place. And boy has Pixar nailed it! The Story has taken itself to a whole new level, it's all about getting back to a young boy by using the power of teamwork, accepting for what you are, and telling the truth in an innocent way. Woody never meant to hurt Buzz, he just wanted to spend his life with Andy. The other toys are blinded by this accident that they decide to toss their leader out like garbage. Sid is what I believe the best villain for three reasons .He's the bully for the toys .He's stuck in the mind of a mad doctor or scientist .He learns an important lesson that toys are meant to be in heaven, not in toy hell. Unless you're a Losto Bear who thinks that humans are the enemies. Man! This is the reason why people loved the 's. There was a time when animation wanted to push itself to next level. And Toy Story was one the important examples of being the greatest survivors with a lovely story, fresh start animation, amazing characters, and epic songs by Randy Newman. This could be a fresh start for those who wanna tell stories. In fact I have novel that I'm working on. It's on my Watpadd. Check it out https://www.wattpad.com/story/-meme-world Toys, a symbol of our childhood; This film tells a story of rivalry between two toys: a cowboy doll named Woody and an action figure named Buzz Lightyear. They will fight for the affection of a child from the moment that Buzz is offered to him as a gift, threatening Woody's place as his favorite toy. A rivalry that will lead to a strong friendship between them. Directed by John Lasseter, one of the brightest minds of Pixar Studios, the film features the voices of Tom Hanks (as Woody) and Tim Allen (as Buzz) for the main characters. This was the film that launched Pixar to success, in a journey that still goes and deserves the respect of all admirers of the seventh art. The story of this film is deeply moving, not only to focus on strong themes like loyalty and friendship but, mainly, because it mess with our fondest memories by involving toys that we all played when we were kids. Its not a coincidence that we see, in this film, toys of our parents and grandparents living with action figures and games of our time. This film tries to touch everyone, from the small audience to the adults who take them to the movies. It's a great movie for the family and it's still current today, twenty years after his premiere. great job; this movie was such a great family movie. My daughter absolutely loves all the toy story movies we watched every single one of them and it always gets to us. great job to the creator of the movie. I loved how my daughter reacts to the movie when her favorite part comes up. I think she seen this movie so many times she probably knows the lines already. Woody is such an awesome cowboys i think he is one of my favorite characters along with little Bo-peep and slinky. Every toy in that movie make a really good team. I thought it was mean that woody pushed buzz out the window because he was a jealous toy. But I'm glad him and buzz get along great. one of the best animated; In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present, a group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy Davis (John Morris), are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his single mother (Laurie Metcalf) and infant sister Molly are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess (Annie Potts), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex the Dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberger) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge (R. Lee Ermey), spy on the party and report the results to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift  an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who believes that he is an actual space ranger. Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie; I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about. Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys. The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys. Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film. toys are alive; ****spoiler***** All of children have some toys, for example, baby dole, teddy bear, gun and so on, but everyone doesn't think that the toys able to move, speak and have their live. If it was true, it is a little scared, but it is so interesting to image their living. But in this movie, it seem that the toys don't know that they are made by someone at first. The setting is so interesting, When BUZZ he is a new toy of his master knows that he is not a real hero, he is so depressed because he had lost his identity. But the lead character, WOODY, helps him, even if he is hated by his friends. The time when BUZZ accepts his real potential and gets over a trial with WOODY makes us exciting and it makes us forget that they are toys sometimes. This is the first successful film which is the CG animation for Disney films and the anecdote of STEVE JOBS and JOHN ALAN LASSETER will not disappear forever. Great fun, a film that's not just for kids; I wasn't too sure about this film before I watched it. The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story. The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up  something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space! Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home. Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is  years old, but I've only just seen it!). The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others  such as Mr. Potato Head  are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep  who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries! The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back. Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible. The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films  particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations. All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again. And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them? Well, now we know why! The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in  lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Fantastic animated movie for all ages.; Toy Story is a fantastic animated movie for all ages. The movies stars toys brought to life and their tiny adventures. Full of thrill, comedy and charm. Even though the computer graphics are starting to get a bit dated, it's incredibly fascinating seeing Pixars humble beginnings. This is the movie that laid the groundwork for their continued successes. The movie stars Tim Allan as Buzz Lightyear, Tom Hanks as Woody, just to name a few of the talented actors that have loaned their voices to this instant classic. I highly recommended this movie to anyone looking for a good time. Pixar's overall # best, one of the best parts of my childhood, overall best animated film, and one of the best films in general as well; Toy Story is the very first animated film ever made in history, it's the overall best and set the bar high for plenty of future computer animated films in general for a lot of good reasons. Pixar's first film takes place in a world where toys come alive when nobody is around, the story centers around a pull string cowboy doll named Woody who's voiced by Tom Hanks, he's the favorite toy of a young boy named Andy, but that changes when Andy gets a new action figure for his birthday, that particular toy is Buzz Lightyear who is voiced by Tim Allen, Buzz wins all the attention which makes Woody inevitably jealous and forces him to try to get rid of Buzz, resulting in them getting separated from Andy, therefore, they must put their differences aside and try to get back to Andy before him and his family move to their new house. With great writers like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, and Joss Whedon, the story as a whole needs nothing more and nothing less, it's just right, every scene advances the story forward. The characters are all memorable, the Pizza Planet aliens, the cowardly Rex voiced by Wallace Shawn, the know-it-all Hamm the piggy bank voiced by John Ratzenberger, the loyal Slinky-Dog voiced by Jim Varney, and the sassy and rude but always hilarious Mr. Potato-Head who's voiced by Don Rickles. But the best characters are the two main protagonists, Buzz Lightyear is a character that took a life of his own and became a pop-cultural phenomenon over night, even getting his own TV show, in fact in December  every child on the planet wanted a Buzz Lightyear action figure, which is what Buzz represents the toy we all wanted when we were kids but weren't lucky enough to get, the ultimate action hero of the ultimate hero, and on top of all that casting Tim Allen to do his voice is by far one the best voice over performances of all time. Then there's Woody, Tom Hanks' performance as the sheriff of these parts was outrageously flawless, he's an old soul and his case is quite literal, considering he is a toy from the early generation which we didn't grow up in, but he is probably the character we can relate to the most. As for the best scene, the end of the final chase scene when Buzz and Woody are flying through the air after almost being blown up by a rocket: Woody: Hey Buzz you're flying! Buzz: this isn't flying, this is falling with style! Where Buzz finally achieves what he knew he could do from the start and Woody can put his doubts aside. Get the family together and get ready to go as Buzz and Woody put it \"TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!\"  This movie was one of the best d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an ..(I gave it an ) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! G.o.a.t; I loved this film. For me, this is the best animated movie of all time. I think the story is very heartfelt and captures the relationship between a young boy and his toys really well. It has a universal message that applies to all ages: love. I think they did a great job with the range of characters, too; Each one brings a different perspective/attitude that really crosses over into real life whilst maintaining true to their toy-personality. This movie has good elements of comedy and drama, good guys/bad guys, heroes and aliens. It is a feel-good, timeless movie that will be relevant for generations to come. Good, Creative charm for kids and adults!; I'm not a huge fan of animated films, so coming into Toy Story I had very low expectations. At first, I thought it was Meh. Then, as the movie progressed it got better and better. Buzz is funny, Woody is a good cowboy, Sid is awesomely evil. Toy Story has an amazing cast as well. I mean, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, AND the Amazing Don RICKLES as Mr. Potato Head! Toy Story keeps kids and adults on their feet and I'm praising it so much because I have never seen any ANIMATED film as good as Toy Story so far. Disney really worked their magic into this classic. Toy Story FTW. I'm going to go rent Toy Story , and see if this film series has advanced even further. The one that started it all; In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In , they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be % made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history. The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having \"souls\" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was. Rating: ,/ Best Kids Movie of All-Time; When ever I here someone hating on this movie I cant believe it. What is not to like about this movie? It is a story about realizing who your true friends are in times of trouble and learning to live with what you are. This movie is something not only kids will like but their parents will love it too. I know for a while my mom liked this movie more than I did. Tom Hanks was perfect for the role of Woody and his paranoid attitude is what makes the movie what it is (morally). Change is a good thing and this movie changed everything. Even though the graphics are obviously outdated everything still works as well as it did almost  years ago! and Im feeling old.... But it is a must see for anyone i would love to buy this movie but i cannot find it anywhere, that says something. Hanks and Allen are hilarious even animated!; As if Tom Hanks wasn't talented enough...someone had the brilliant idea to animate him! Not to mention pair Hanks great sense of humor with comedic genius Tim Allen! Together, these two keep the giggles and laughs coming in this cute and successful Disney Pixar flick that spawned an even cuter sequal! Pixar's first full length movie.; This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back  years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies. Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only  when I first watched it in theaters). The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like \"Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc.\" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him. Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a \"Buzz Lightyear\" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys. Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more. I give it an / perfect movie for the whole family to watch. One Of The Great Animated Features Of The 's!; If you love Toy Story , then, you'll love this original classic!!! The first Disney/Pixar production (And, the first animated feature to be computer made) is well worth a double feature with Toy Story -of course! If A Bug's Life can knock Antz and The Prince Of Egypt out of the minds of moviegoers, Toy Story have no rivals to forget! One of a kind! - the first computer-animated film and a touching story of friendship; This movie is just awesome! Bearing in mind that this was a film from /, the quality of the realistic D animation is stunning and what a perfect way to start a new era! Just as a new form of animation comes to life, a vast number of toys magically come to life when their child-owner Andy is out of the room. Maybe that's a true-to-life symbolisation! From the word go, every single one of those toys have become so famous and iconic. Argos (especially), Toys R Us, Amazon, Woolworths and more have never, since the film's -release, been without stock of them! Like it says in the summary, it's a heart-warming story as well as a funny, super-cool movie about a pull-string ragdoll (Woody) whose popularity is short-lived as Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday as a result of new electronic toys hitting the market proving to be better than a just a ragdoll. Understandably, Woody is jealous of Buzz and can't stand his guts. He's an arrogant, self-interested toy but, more than anything else, an total, utter idiot. All the toys have their own personalities; there's Little Bo Peep who has a soft spot for Woody, Slinky Dog who likes Woody and is very friendly, Rex the world's most IRRITATING dinosaur ever, RC, the RC who revs up and down rather than talks and then there's Mr Potato Head and he is VILE! So, so mean and frequently rude. He seems to have some kind of vendetta against Woody for no reason I can think of. Then, he creates his very own campaign to destroy Woody in order to avenge Buzz when Woody's the one who has felt lonely and unwanted for so long! You'd think it'd put children off the authentic Mr Potato Head by Playskool! Oh yes and there's one more toy I didn't mention - Lenny, the toy-sized pair of binoculars. He was voiced by Joe Ranft who contributed in the story development of \"Toy Story\" and is now sadly no longer on this earth. He was killed when the speed of his car went beyond control, crashed through the wall of a bridge and plunged into the river below. The Pixar team miss him terribly... JOE RANFT - The one that started it all; Toy Story will forever be remembered as the first feature film to be fully animated by computer. Since its debut in , dozens more have joined it, including a sequel (soon to be two sequels as of this writing), as well as several other excellent films from its animation company, Pixar. However, for its unique accomplishment, Toy Story stands alone. It doesn't hurt that even beyond the technical achievement, the film is charming, well-written, and touching. The toys in question belong to Andy, who has a huge variety of them scattered around his room. The unofficial head toy is Woody, a cowboy toy who has \"been Andy's favorite since kindergarten\". Woody loves being the favored toy, but the order is shaken up when Andy receives a surprise present on his birthday: a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who causes Woody to become jealous when he begins to take over the # toy position in Andy's playtime. There's a lot of good stuff in this film: The animation, which mostly still works  years later; the voice acting, which is carried out excellently; the story, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. What gets me most about Toy Story is the way that both Woody and Buzz must grow throughout the movie. Woody has to let go of his jealousy and accept that things change when someone new enters the mix. Buzz has to learn (the hard way) that he really is a toy, but that he has a very important role as such. This is better character development than we see in some \"more mature\" films. It was here that Pixar began a long line of memorable, excellently crafted characters. Pixar has released ten feature films in the past fifteen years. Toy Story  this summer will make eleven. They've maintained a very high standard of quality during that time. It definitely helps that, with Toy Story, they were off to an excellent start. First Pixar Film, Did Amazing; I Recentely Re-Watched Toy Story And I Think That Every Time I Watch This Film, It Gets Better. This Is Basically The Plot. Sheriff Toy Is Jealous When A New, Cooler Toy Named Buzz Lightyear Came And Changed The Sheriff. Then The Sheriff And The Space Ranger Are Proceeded To Be Tortured By A Toy-Torturer Named Sid, A Boy Who Loves Giving Pain To All Toys. I Think That This Film Is One of, If Not, One of The Best D Animated Movies EVER. Some Scenes Give You The Feels, Some Get You Into The Movie. Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) Was A Masterpiece In This First Installment of The Toy Story Trilogy. Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) Was Completely Enthusiastic In This Movie. I Think Most People Think Sid Is A Toy Serial Killer. I Agree. Sid Is Completely At It With Giving His 'Pain Surgery' To Fellow Toys Who Were Tormented By His Schemes. This Movie Has A Great Plot, Gives Character Development, Chose Great Actors That Overall, Enjoyed Their Parts! This Deserves At Least A / For An Outstanding D Animated Movie In . It's a Happy Movie! Ya there's spoilers; I put this computer animated movie just on the cusp of being great. You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time..../ This DVD is part of the Toy Story  Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages. Quality animation always looks good on the big screen and this looks wonderful. This is a Buy and Hold to flesh out your collection to include 'Happy Movies' as my daughter puts it. The DVD is a solid / Awesome; A very sweet and fun movie. TOY STORY has great computer animation. A simple yet well told story is also added as well. The voice overs are top notch and everyone gets a fair share in this movie. PIXAR has done a good job placing itself on the map. Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle. Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel. A good rent. On it's th Birthday, Toy Story still soars To Infinity and Beyond!; In , Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help. They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as \"Toy Story\", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about. First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the \"I'm Mrs Nesbitt\" sequence and the \"You Are A Toy\" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies \"You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic \"To Infinity and Beyond\" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history. There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's  minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" and \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" hit the right notes by being memorable songs. Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school. Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy th Birthday. Classic!; \"Toy Story\" is one of the best animated films ever created! The movie is about Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) hating each other like no other. Buzz accidently fell out of the window and Woody is accused by all the other toys of having killed him. He has to go look for him outside so they can return to Andy's room. But they got into trouble by a toy torturer while trying to get home. \"Toy Story\" is a must-see for everybody who likes Disney and it is for all ages to watch! Followed by an amazing sequel! / stars!</td>\n",

       "      <td>A great movie for All ages!; Jumanji! based on the story's by Chris Van Allsburg Robin Williams is a blast! The effects were groundbreaking. The movie itself is highly original. What are you waiting for! if you haven't seen this, be ready for some quality family time! why an ? Because it is simply fun and entertaining. Sure it is not a perfect movie , but this is what a movie is supposed to be. i am SHOCKED by the low rating!!! . really?, Unlike dark knight or inception, which are awful in every way, this is actually entertaining and fun. A little creepy for the faint of heart... \"kids\" but they will survive! this is in a world of its own!!!!! and it deserves far more then the . it receives id like to see it reaching a . for entertainment value only! not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is , and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats.  years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number  on The  Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number  on The  Greatest Family Films. Very good! Stupid, but fun, family adventure; Board games aren't as popular as they used to be. Before the likes of Xbox and Facebook, we had classic board games such as Go For Broke and Game Of Life. Luckily, we didn't have anything like Jumanji; a mystical board game which magically comes to life as you're playing. It sounds incredibly fun, which is what young Alan Parrish thinks, minutes before he is sucked into the game and left to fend for himself for  years. Reawakened by a younger generation, old Alan, played by the late Robin Williams, must finish the game before it engulfs the entire town. If it sounds a little ridiculous, that's because it is. But it is a heck of a lot of fun as well. Robin Williams brings his usual maniacal charm and injects healthy doses of humour when the movie threatens to take itself too seriously and a young Kirsten Dunst offers ample support as one of the younger players. But the real star of the show is the effects; we are treated to scenes of an animal stampede through the streets, a monsoon inside a huge mansion and, in a wonderful subplot, one of the players is gradually transformed into a monkey because he tries to cheat the game. It is almost  years old now so, understandably, some of the effects don't quite hold up, with the monkeys being the prime example but the premise is so much fun that you won't really mind a few dodgy effects shots here or there. It also takes a little while to find its feet, with the beginning seeming to drag on for a little longer than necessary, and the ending may be a little to sickly sweet for some tastes. But once the main plot gets going it barely stops for breath as the players have to deal with any threat that the game delivers and a big part of the fun is waiting to see what the game will spit out next. A wonderfully fun family film with plenty of thrills and a great premise. Not for + age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for  not for . Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. review for jumanji.; This  film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game  years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are + as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than  and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around  when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably  or , so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. IT's the most great movie EVER, you can't get Enough of it; I want to give this movie what it really deserve ,If i will say there is movie that i will never forget in my life ,it will be this great movie for the brilliant actor robin Williams. first of all, I want to thanks all the cast of this movie and the great director ,for bringing it to us. when I want to be refresh and happy and laugh I will watch it when I want to feel the power of love and the thriller of adventure, I will watch it , there are a lot of people how see it as for children only but its really not , it was like they know where to start and finish. this movie is for everyone its my best movie ever I give it % don't miss it original, not like any other game; I saw this when I was , and I was obsessed with it and saw it  times in the theater, and it was my favorite movie. The whole idea of slight, unhappy, -year-old Alan Parrsih (Adam Hann-Byrd-Little man Tate, Halloween H:) getting trapped in a board game in , for -years and coming back as a grown man. The idea was unforgettable to my interest in time, and I imagined my self then coming back -years old. The movie is so elaborate and original, the stampede was always my favorite, it's got such edge-of-year seat action with the Rhinos, Elephants, and Zebras crashing throught the wall at the last second, and they used the most dangerous animals possible. Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) ALan's childhood friend, and Peter (Bradley Pierce) and Judy (Kirsten Dunst, along with Alan play the game and bring Gian mosquitos, vines and a Hunter from the game. The movies also really funny especially the cop. Robin Williams Best Film; Robin Williams is a great actor who has made some great films over the years but I think Jumanji is the best. I mean, what more could you possibly ask for? It's a great idea-as a child I would have loved a board-game like that. It's certainly a very gripping movie throughout-the more the players get involved the worse things become. Before you know it elephant's and rhino's are on the loose trashing a town and there's a mad hunter lurking around too. This is one of those films which you can watch again and again and still enjoy. I recommend it highly-it has a great plot, great acting and some great scenes. Watch out for the scene with the male lion on the bed.  Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... Great fun; Robin Williams is in his element as an adult/child and with wonderful support from Kirsten Dunst, Ian Richardson playing the Englishman hunter and sending himself up nicely, the excellent children and others make this escapist adventure at it's best. Til the dice read five or eight  Jumanji; Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in , I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in , transporting him into the jungle world for  years until two new children stumble upon its drumming. Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time  well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects. The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be \"real\", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end. The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still childrenone had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow upand with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think. There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as \"Soulman\" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the \"adult\" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal. good original family movie; Joe Johnston's Jumanji is very good family movie that is well paced. The movie is the story of a mysterious game that involves it's players more than the normal board game. The movie begins with a young boy, Alan Parrish, finding the abandoned game. He talks the girl he has a crush on, Sarah Whittle, into playing with him. Once the game starts, chaos ensues. Robin Williams carries this movie, giving it life. The other actors do okay with the bare dialogue. Joe Johnston uses the experiences on the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies to craft a fantasy world that is believable. Though not outstanding in any way, Jumanji is a fun movie that should delight children with its action and fantasy.  out of  stars. Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for (?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\" Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a /. My first childhood film and one of my all time favorites!; I was born in  so I am one year older than but my Uncle bought a copy of Jumanji when I was in pre-school and the whole family watched it together. And after seeing the film for the first time, the story is just like a funny adventure to me and I really love it. I always sneak up to the CD cabinet to watch it again because my grandmother always gone mad every time I switch the CD player and the television. And after a several replays, the movie grown deeper to me; the message of the film and everything. Until now, I still watch the movie and still having lots of laugh. A Great Family Entertainer!; Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid &amp; I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism &amp; magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh &amp; Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining &amp; magical. It offers humor, magic &amp; emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography &amp; Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd &amp; Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up! Jumanji Review; Jumanji is a film directed by Joe Johnston based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg. Now I wasn't quite excited to see the films considering the reviews. But I did enjoy Zathura, the spiritual sequel to this film so I deiced to give it a go. And to my surprise I was quite entertained by the film. Plot: Judy and Peter play a board game to some disastrous results. Story and direction: The film opens up with  children from  burying something and saying that whoever opens this up may God be with them. I mean this scene was basically not necessary. The film could have opened from  with our protagonist Alan Parrish. We see Alan's world where he is bullied a lot and hides in his father's shoe factory. There we are introduced to Carl who I think was not necessary for the film in the first place. Then we see Alan taking the Jumanji game to his home and opening it. in the meanwhile, we see Alan's parents deciding to send him to boarding school to which he objects and decides never to talk to them again. Then Alan and Sarah begin to play the game when Alan gets sucked into it and Sarah getting scared runs for her life. Then the film takes a  year leap, where we are introduced to  new characters Peter and Judy, who have been given a quite nice back story. They open up the game and while they playing Alan comes out of it. Then we are taken on a joyride where the try to finish the game with a now grown Sarah. Now the thing that felt awful in the film was the CGI. It felt like you were watching some big patches of imagery that were just pasted onto the screen. Then I guess the Van Pelt character. He was just too laughable for me. And was wasted a lot. And finally, the revised  version wherein some things were not explained rightly, according to me. Performances: Robin Williams made me remember that why I will be remembering him as a great actor. His comic timing was spot on. RIP Sir Williams. Bonnie Hunt was also great as Sarah. Kirsten Dunst was a great child artist in the film. So as Bradley Pierce. Favirite Scene: The scene where Alan pops up to save Peter and Judy from a lion and his joy that he has returned home after  years of being trapped in the game. Robin Williams just acted so great in this scene. Verdict: Although with some misses, Jumanji is a very much watchable film. I enjoyed my time with this movie. I am going with a ./ Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Has more depth than the book, but lacks much of its lustre; When I was in fifth Grade, I read a book called Jumanji. It was a  book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera. A year later (February or March ), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In , two young chaps bury in a chest \"Jumanji\", a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy.  years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in , but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight\"; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic , where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost... Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm. The other three characters, but the movie is so focused on the four players that everyone else looks like a decoration set. The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining . But the screenplay touches on the drama scenes so lightly that they do not create much justice to the film. The anarchic present looks like a throwback of Back to the Future II's Alternate . But all ends well at the conclusion, and people will find it likable, including those who read the book. By the way, this was the first time I heard about Kirsten Dunst... **/ out of **** Grade A Effects; This movie is the kind of movie you wouldn't want to watch when you're trying to get to sleep. This movie is lurking with action and adventure around every corner, along with some animals. Great effects, good plot, and interesting characters. A *** out of ****.</td>\n",

It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at  AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached , God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the  teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his  years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life &amp; Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau &amp; Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman &amp; John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a . out of  the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in , noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A() vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A() there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's , lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my -year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG- rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was  at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was --a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. / stars. Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from . The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment.  stars out of . Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter &amp; Jack's previous films together. It was this film &amp; the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max &amp; John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the  adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. Classic sequel, better than st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the st --. out of  for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from . The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe yrs old, and must have seen it over  x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it  minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***/ (out of four) Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. One of the best movies of !; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having  or  scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about  minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as / Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT  out of  Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. / stars - John Ulmer More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in ,  years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie  out of . The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from  is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $ of the $ that I paid to see it. I give this one  out of . Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" Hilarious in Parts;  was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in , the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for  + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those  minutes back of my life. Please. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this  film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about  or  and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. A  is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Great female flick of the 's!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track : This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no. and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops &amp; horrible movies. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in  at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four  something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker.  of  stars. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course % of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the  movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the  classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the  year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $k bonus to move out in  days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a , i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September ,  - Video Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part  right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part  still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part  is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part  is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. / Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. . out of  stars. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in . It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the  sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of . This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late ''s)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie.</td>\n",

       "0  Best Film of the 's!; That film has made its first success with the most beloved buddy picture of all time! The Next Who Framed Roger Rabbit I love how they try to make something different with CGI, because all they've done in the beginning were commercials and shorts. Ever since John Lasseter saw Tron, he knew that CGI would go all over the place. And boy has Pixar nailed it! The Story has taken itself to a whole new level, it's all about getting back to a young boy by using the power of teamwork, accepting for what you are, and telling the truth in an innocent way. Woody never meant to hurt Buzz, he just wanted to spend his life with Andy. The other toys are blinded by this accident that they decide to toss their leader out like garbage. Sid is what I believe the best villain for three reasons .He's the bully for the toys .He's stuck in the mind of a mad doctor or scientist .He learns an important lesson that toys are meant to be in heaven, not in toy hell. Unless you're a Losto Bear who thinks that humans are the enemies. Man! This is the reason why people loved the 's. There was a time when animation wanted to push itself to next level. And Toy Story was one the important examples of being the greatest survivors with a lovely story, fresh start animation, amazing characters, and epic songs by Randy Newman. This could be a fresh start for those who wanna tell stories. In fact I have novel that I'm working on. It's on my Watpadd. Check it out https://www.wattpad.com/story/-meme-world Toys, a symbol of our childhood; This film tells a story of rivalry between two toys: a cowboy doll named Woody and an action figure named Buzz Lightyear. They will fight for the affection of a child from the moment that Buzz is offered to him as a gift, threatening Woody's place as his favorite toy. A rivalry that will lead to a strong friendship between them. Directed by John Lasseter, one of the brightest minds of Pixar Studios, the film features the voices of Tom Hanks (as Woody) and Tim Allen (as Buzz) for the main characters. This was the film that launched Pixar to success, in a journey that still goes and deserves the respect of all admirers of the seventh art. The story of this film is deeply moving, not only to focus on strong themes like loyalty and friendship but, mainly, because it mess with our fondest memories by involving toys that we all played when we were kids. Its not a coincidence that we see, in this film, toys of our parents and grandparents living with action figures and games of our time. This film tries to touch everyone, from the small audience to the adults who take them to the movies. It's a great movie for the family and it's still current today, twenty years after his premiere. great job; this movie was such a great family movie. My daughter absolutely loves all the toy story movies we watched every single one of them and it always gets to us. great job to the creator of the movie. I loved how my daughter reacts to the movie when her favorite part comes up. I think she seen this movie so many times she probably knows the lines already. Woody is such an awesome cowboys i think he is one of my favorite characters along with little Bo-peep and slinky. Every toy in that movie make a really good team. I thought it was mean that woody pushed buzz out the window because he was a jealous toy. But I'm glad him and buzz get along great. one of the best animated; In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present, a group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy Davis (John Morris), are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his single mother (Laurie Metcalf) and infant sister Molly are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess (Annie Potts), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex the Dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberger) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge (R. Lee Ermey), spy on the party and report the results to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift  an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who believes that he is an actual space ranger. Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie; I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about. Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys. The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys. Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film. toys are alive; ****spoiler***** All of children have some toys, for example, baby dole, teddy bear, gun and so on, but everyone doesn't think that the toys able to move, speak and have their live. If it was true, it is a little scared, but it is so interesting to image their living. But in this movie, it seem that the toys don't know that they are made by someone at first. The setting is so interesting, When BUZZ he is a new toy of his master knows that he is not a real hero, he is so depressed because he had lost his identity. But the lead character, WOODY, helps him, even if he is hated by his friends. The time when BUZZ accepts his real potential and gets over a trial with WOODY makes us exciting and it makes us forget that they are toys sometimes. This is the first successful film which is the CG animation for Disney films and the anecdote of STEVE JOBS and JOHN ALAN LASSETER will not disappear forever. Great fun, a film that's not just for kids; I wasn't too sure about this film before I watched it. The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story. The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up  something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space! Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home. Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is  years old, but I've only just seen it!). The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others  such as Mr. Potato Head  are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep  who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries! The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back. Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible. The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films  particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations. All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again. And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them? Well, now we know why! The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in  lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Fantastic animated movie for all ages.; Toy Story is a fantastic animated movie for all ages. The movies stars toys brought to life and their tiny adventures. Full of thrill, comedy and charm. Even though the computer graphics are starting to get a bit dated, it's incredibly fascinating seeing Pixars humble beginnings. This is the movie that laid the groundwork for their continued successes. The movie stars Tim Allan as Buzz Lightyear, Tom Hanks as Woody, just to name a few of the talented actors that have loaned their voices to this instant classic. I highly recommended this movie to anyone looking for a good time. Pixar's overall # best, one of the best parts of my childhood, overall best animated film, and one of the best films in general as well; Toy Story is the very first animated film ever made in history, it's the overall best and set the bar high for plenty of future computer animated films in general for a lot of good reasons. Pixar's first film takes place in a world where toys come alive when nobody is around, the story centers around a pull string cowboy doll named Woody who's voiced by Tom Hanks, he's the favorite toy of a young boy named Andy, but that changes when Andy gets a new action figure for his birthday, that particular toy is Buzz Lightyear who is voiced by Tim Allen, Buzz wins all the attention which makes Woody inevitably jealous and forces him to try to get rid of Buzz, resulting in them getting separated from Andy, therefore, they must put their differences aside and try to get back to Andy before him and his family move to their new house. With great writers like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, and Joss Whedon, the story as a whole needs nothing more and nothing less, it's just right, every scene advances the story forward. The characters are all memorable, the Pizza Planet aliens, the cowardly Rex voiced by Wallace Shawn, the know-it-all Hamm the piggy bank voiced by John Ratzenberger, the loyal Slinky-Dog voiced by Jim Varney, and the sassy and rude but always hilarious Mr. Potato-Head who's voiced by Don Rickles. But the best characters are the two main protagonists, Buzz Lightyear is a character that took a life of his own and became a pop-cultural phenomenon over night, even getting his own TV show, in fact in December  every child on the planet wanted a Buzz Lightyear action figure, which is what Buzz represents the toy we all wanted when we were kids but weren't lucky enough to get, the ultimate action hero of the ultimate hero, and on top of all that casting Tim Allen to do his voice is by far one the best voice over performances of all time. Then there's Woody, Tom Hanks' performance as the sheriff of these parts was outrageously flawless, he's an old soul and his case is quite literal, considering he is a toy from the early generation which we didn't grow up in, but he is probably the character we can relate to the most. As for the best scene, the end of the final chase scene when Buzz and Woody are flying through the air after almost being blown up by a rocket: Woody: Hey Buzz you're flying! Buzz: this isn't flying, this is falling with style! Where Buzz finally achieves what he knew he could do from the start and Woody can put his doubts aside. Get the family together and get ready to go as Buzz and Woody put it \"TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!\"  This movie was one of the best d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an ..(I gave it an ) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! G.o.a.t; I loved this film. For me, this is the best animated movie of all time. I think the story is very heartfelt and captures the relationship between a young boy and his toys really well. It has a universal message that applies to all ages: love. I think they did a great job with the range of characters, too; Each one brings a different perspective/attitude that really crosses over into real life whilst maintaining true to their toy-personality. This movie has good elements of comedy and drama, good guys/bad guys, heroes and aliens. It is a feel-good, timeless movie that will be relevant for generations to come. Good, Creative charm for kids and adults!; I'm not a huge fan of animated films, so coming into Toy Story I had very low expectations. At first, I thought it was Meh. Then, as the movie progressed it got better and better. Buzz is funny, Woody is a good cowboy, Sid is awesomely evil. Toy Story has an amazing cast as well. I mean, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, AND the Amazing Don RICKLES as Mr. Potato Head! Toy Story keeps kids and adults on their feet and I'm praising it so much because I have never seen any ANIMATED film as good as Toy Story so far. Disney really worked their magic into this classic. Toy Story FTW. I'm going to go rent Toy Story , and see if this film series has advanced even further. The one that started it all; In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In , they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be % made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history. The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having \"souls\" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was. Rating: ,/ Best Kids Movie of All-Time; When ever I here someone hating on this movie I cant believe it. What is not to like about this movie? It is a story about realizing who your true friends are in times of trouble and learning to live with what you are. This movie is something not only kids will like but their parents will love it too. I know for a while my mom liked this movie more than I did. Tom Hanks was perfect for the role of Woody and his paranoid attitude is what makes the movie what it is (morally). Change is a good thing and this movie changed everything. Even though the graphics are obviously outdated everything still works as well as it did almost  years ago! and Im feeling old.... But it is a must see for anyone i would love to buy this movie but i cannot find it anywhere, that says something. Hanks and Allen are hilarious even animated!; As if Tom Hanks wasn't talented enough...someone had the brilliant idea to animate him! Not to mention pair Hanks great sense of humor with comedic genius Tim Allen! Together, these two keep the giggles and laughs coming in this cute and successful Disney Pixar flick that spawned an even cuter sequal! Pixar's first full length movie.; This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back  years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies. Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only  when I first watched it in theaters). The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like \"Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc.\" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him. Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a \"Buzz Lightyear\" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys. Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more. I give it an / perfect movie for the whole family to watch. One Of The Great Animated Features Of The 's!; If you love Toy Story , then, you'll love this original classic!!! The first Disney/Pixar production (And, the first animated feature to be computer made) is well worth a double feature with Toy Story -of course! If A Bug's Life can knock Antz and The Prince Of Egypt out of the minds of moviegoers, Toy Story have no rivals to forget! One of a kind! - the first computer-animated film and a touching story of friendship; This movie is just awesome! Bearing in mind that this was a film from /, the quality of the realistic D animation is stunning and what a perfect way to start a new era! Just as a new form of animation comes to life, a vast number of toys magically come to life when their child-owner Andy is out of the room. Maybe that's a true-to-life symbolisation! From the word go, every single one of those toys have become so famous and iconic. Argos (especially), Toys R Us, Amazon, Woolworths and more have never, since the film's -release, been without stock of them! Like it says in the summary, it's a heart-warming story as well as a funny, super-cool movie about a pull-string ragdoll (Woody) whose popularity is short-lived as Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday as a result of new electronic toys hitting the market proving to be better than a just a ragdoll. Understandably, Woody is jealous of Buzz and can't stand his guts. He's an arrogant, self-interested toy but, more than anything else, an total, utter idiot. All the toys have their own personalities; there's Little Bo Peep who has a soft spot for Woody, Slinky Dog who likes Woody and is very friendly, Rex the world's most IRRITATING dinosaur ever, RC, the RC who revs up and down rather than talks and then there's Mr Potato Head and he is VILE! So, so mean and frequently rude. He seems to have some kind of vendetta against Woody for no reason I can think of. Then, he creates his very own campaign to destroy Woody in order to avenge Buzz when Woody's the one who has felt lonely and unwanted for so long! You'd think it'd put children off the authentic Mr Potato Head by Playskool! Oh yes and there's one more toy I didn't mention - Lenny, the toy-sized pair of binoculars. He was voiced by Joe Ranft who contributed in the story development of \"Toy Story\" and is now sadly no longer on this earth. He was killed when the speed of his car went beyond control, crashed through the wall of a bridge and plunged into the river below. The Pixar team miss him terribly... JOE RANFT - The one that started it all; Toy Story will forever be remembered as the first feature film to be fully animated by computer. Since its debut in , dozens more have joined it, including a sequel (soon to be two sequels as of this writing), as well as several other excellent films from its animation company, Pixar. However, for its unique accomplishment, Toy Story stands alone. It doesn't hurt that even beyond the technical achievement, the film is charming, well-written, and touching. The toys in question belong to Andy, who has a huge variety of them scattered around his room. The unofficial head toy is Woody, a cowboy toy who has \"been Andy's favorite since kindergarten\". Woody loves being the favored toy, but the order is shaken up when Andy receives a surprise present on his birthday: a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who causes Woody to become jealous when he begins to take over the # toy position in Andy's playtime. There's a lot of good stuff in this film: The animation, which mostly still works  years later; the voice acting, which is carried out excellently; the story, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. What gets me most about Toy Story is the way that both Woody and Buzz must grow throughout the movie. Woody has to let go of his jealousy and accept that things change when someone new enters the mix. Buzz has to learn (the hard way) that he really is a toy, but that he has a very important role as such. This is better character development than we see in some \"more mature\" films. It was here that Pixar began a long line of memorable, excellently crafted characters. Pixar has released ten feature films in the past fifteen years. Toy Story  this summer will make eleven. They've maintained a very high standard of quality during that time. It definitely helps that, with Toy Story, they were off to an excellent start. First Pixar Film, Did Amazing; I Recentely Re-Watched Toy Story And I Think That Every Time I Watch This Film, It Gets Better. This Is Basically The Plot. Sheriff Toy Is Jealous When A New, Cooler Toy Named Buzz Lightyear Came And Changed The Sheriff. Then The Sheriff And The Space Ranger Are Proceeded To Be Tortured By A Toy-Torturer Named Sid, A Boy Who Loves Giving Pain To All Toys. I Think That This Film Is One of, If Not, One of The Best D Animated Movies EVER. Some Scenes Give You The Feels, Some Get You Into The Movie. Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) Was A Masterpiece In This First Installment of The Toy Story Trilogy. Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) Was Completely Enthusiastic In This Movie. I Think Most People Think Sid Is A Toy Serial Killer. I Agree. Sid Is Completely At It With Giving His 'Pain Surgery' To Fellow Toys Who Were Tormented By His Schemes. This Movie Has A Great Plot, Gives Character Development, Chose Great Actors That Overall, Enjoyed Their Parts! This Deserves At Least A / For An Outstanding D Animated Movie In . It's a Happy Movie! Ya there's spoilers; I put this computer animated movie just on the cusp of being great. You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time..../ This DVD is part of the Toy Story  Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages. Quality animation always looks good on the big screen and this looks wonderful. This is a Buy and Hold to flesh out your collection to include 'Happy Movies' as my daughter puts it. The DVD is a solid / Awesome; A very sweet and fun movie. TOY STORY has great computer animation. A simple yet well told story is also added as well. The voice overs are top notch and everyone gets a fair share in this movie. PIXAR has done a good job placing itself on the map. Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle. Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel. A good rent. On it's th Birthday, Toy Story still soars To Infinity and Beyond!; In , Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help. They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as \"Toy Story\", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about. First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the \"I'm Mrs Nesbitt\" sequence and the \"You Are A Toy\" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies \"You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic \"To Infinity and Beyond\" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history. There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's  minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" and \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" hit the right notes by being memorable songs. Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school. Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy th Birthday. Classic!; \"Toy Story\" is one of the best animated films ever created! The movie is about Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) hating each other like no other. Buzz accidently fell out of the window and Woody is accused by all the other toys of having killed him. He has to go look for him outside so they can return to Andy's room.

The effects were groundbreaking. The movie itself is highly original. What are you waiting for! if you haven't seen this, be ready for some quality family time! why an ? Because it is simply fun and entertaining. Sure it is not a perfect movie , but this is what a movie is supposed to be. i am SHOCKED by the low rating!!! . really?, Unlike dark knight or inception, which are awful in every way, this is actually entertaining and fun. A little creepy for the faint of heart... \"kids\" but they will survive! this is in a world of its own!!!!! and it deserves far more then the . it receives id like to see it reaching a . for entertainment value only! not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is , and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats.  years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number  on The  Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number  on The  Greatest Family Films. Very good! Stupid, but fun, family adventure; Board games aren't as popular as they used to be. Before the likes of Xbox and Facebook, we had classic board games such as Go For Broke and Game Of Life. Luckily, we didn't have anything like Jumanji; a mystical board game which magically comes to life as you're playing. It sounds incredibly fun, which is what young Alan Parrish thinks, minutes before he is sucked into the game and left to fend for himself for  years. Reawakened by a younger generation, old Alan, played by the late Robin Williams, must finish the game before it engulfs the entire town. If it sounds a little ridiculous, that's because it is. But it is a heck of a lot of fun as well. Robin Williams brings his usual maniacal charm and injects healthy doses of humour when the movie threatens to take itself too seriously and a young Kirsten Dunst offers ample support as one of the younger players. But the real star of the show is the effects; we are treated to scenes of an animal stampede through the streets, a monsoon inside a huge mansion and, in a wonderful subplot, one of the players is gradually transformed into a monkey because he tries to cheat the game. It is almost  years old now so, understandably, some of the effects don't quite hold up, with the monkeys being the prime example but the premise is so much fun that you won't really mind a few dodgy effects shots here or there. It also takes a little while to find its feet, with the beginning seeming to drag on for a little longer than necessary, and the ending may be a little to sickly sweet for some tastes. But once the main plot gets going it barely stops for breath as the players have to deal with any threat that the game delivers and a big part of the fun is waiting to see what the game will spit out next. A wonderfully fun family film with plenty of thrills and a great premise. Not for + age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for  not for . Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. review for jumanji.; This  film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game  years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are + as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than  and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around  when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably  or , so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. IT's the most great movie EVER, you can't get Enough of it; I want to give this movie what it really deserve ,If i will say there is movie that i will never forget in my life ,it will be this great movie for the brilliant actor robin Williams. first of all, I want to thanks all the cast of this movie and the great director ,for bringing it to us. when I want to be refresh and happy and laugh I will watch it when I want to feel the power of love and the thriller of adventure, I will watch it , there are a lot of people how see it as for children only but its really not , it was like they know where to start and finish. this movie is for everyone its my best movie ever I give it % don't miss it original, not like any other game; I saw this when I was , and I was obsessed with it and saw it  times in the theater, and it was my favorite movie. The whole idea of slight, unhappy, -year-old Alan Parrsih (Adam Hann-Byrd-Little man Tate, Halloween H:) getting trapped in a board game in , for -years and coming back as a grown man. The idea was unforgettable to my interest in time, and I imagined my self then coming back -years old. The movie is so elaborate and original, the stampede was always my favorite, it's got such edge-of-year seat action with the Rhinos, Elephants, and Zebras crashing throught the wall at the last second, and they used the most dangerous animals possible. Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) ALan's childhood friend, and Peter (Bradley Pierce) and Judy (Kirsten Dunst, along with Alan play the game and bring Gian mosquitos, vines and a Hunter from the game. The movies also really funny especially the cop. Robin Williams Best Film; Robin Williams is a great actor who has made some great films over the years but I think Jumanji is the best. I mean, what more could you possibly ask for? It's a great idea-as a child I would have loved a board-game like that. It's certainly a very gripping movie throughout-the more the players get involved the worse things become. Before you know it elephant's and rhino's are on the loose trashing a town and there's a mad hunter lurking around too. This is one of those films which you can watch again and again and still enjoy. I recommend it highly-it has a great plot, great acting and some great scenes. Watch out for the scene with the male lion on the bed.  Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... Great fun; Robin Williams is in his element as an adult/child and with wonderful support from Kirsten Dunst, Ian Richardson playing the Englishman hunter and sending himself up nicely, the excellent children and others make this escapist adventure at it's best. Til the dice read five or eight \n",
       " Jumanji; Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in , I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in , transporting him into the jungle world for  years until two new children stumble upon its drumming. Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time \n",
       " well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects. The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be \"real\", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end. The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still childrenone had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow upand with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think. There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as \"Soulman\" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the \"adult\" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal. good original family movie; Joe Johnston's Jumanji is very good family movie that is well paced. The movie is the story of a mysterious game that involves it's players more than the normal board game. The movie begins with a young boy, Alan Parrish, finding the abandoned game. He talks the girl he has a crush on, Sarah Whittle, into playing with him. Once the game starts, chaos ensues. Robin Williams carries this movie, giving it life. The other actors do okay with the bare dialogue. Joe Johnston uses the experiences on the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies to craft a fantasy world that is believable. Though not outstanding in any way, Jumanji is a fun movie that should delight children with its action and fantasy.  out of  stars. Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for (?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\" Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a /. My first childhood film and one of my all time favorites!; I was born in  so I am one year older than but my Uncle bought a copy of Jumanji when I was in pre-school and the whole family watched it together. And after seeing the film for the first time, the story is just like a funny adventure to me and I really love it. I always sneak up to the CD cabinet to watch it again because my grandmother always gone mad every time I switch the CD player and the television. And after a several replays, the movie grown deeper to me; the message of the film and everything. Until now, I still watch the movie and still having lots of laugh. A Great Family Entertainer!; Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid & I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism & magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh & Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining & magical. It offers humor, magic & emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd & Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up! Jumanji Review; Jumanji is a film directed by Joe Johnston based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg. Now I wasn't quite excited to see the films considering the reviews. But I did enjoy Zathura, the spiritual sequel to this film so I deiced to give it a go. And to my surprise I was quite entertained by the film. Plot: Judy and Peter play a board game to some disastrous results. Story and direction: The film opens up with  children from  burying something and saying that whoever opens this up may God be with them. I mean this scene was basically not necessary. The film could have opened from  with our protagonist Alan Parrish. We see Alan's world where he is bullied a lot and hides in his father's shoe factory. There we are introduced to Carl who I think was not necessary for the film in the first place. Then we see Alan taking the Jumanji game to his home and opening it. in the meanwhile, we see Alan's parents deciding to send him to boarding school to which he objects and decides never to talk to them again. Then Alan and Sarah begin to play the game when Alan gets sucked into it and Sarah getting scared runs for her life. Then the film takes a  year leap, where we are introduced to  new characters Peter and Judy, who have been given a quite nice back story. They open up the game and while they playing Alan comes out of it. Then we are taken on a joyride where the try to finish the game with a now grown Sarah. Now the thing that felt awful in the film was the CGI. It felt like you were watching some big patches of imagery that were just pasted onto the screen. Then I guess the Van Pelt character. He was just too laughable for me. And was wasted a lot. And finally, the revised  version wherein some things were not explained rightly, according to me. Performances: Robin Williams made me remember that why I will be remembering him as a great actor. His comic timing was spot on. RIP Sir Williams. Bonnie Hunt was also great as Sarah. Kirsten Dunst was a great child artist in the film. So as Bradley Pierce. Favirite Scene: The scene where Alan pops up to save Peter and Judy from a lion and his joy that he has returned home after  years of being trapped in the game. Robin Williams just acted so great in this scene. Verdict: Although with some misses, Jumanji is a very much watchable film. I enjoyed my time with this movie. I am going with a ./ Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Has more depth than the book, but lacks much of its lustre; When I was in fifth Grade, I read a book called Jumanji. It was a  book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera. A year later (February or March ), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In , two young chaps bury in a chest \"Jumanji\", a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy.  years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in , but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight\"; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic , where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost... Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm. The other three characters, but the movie is so focused on the four players that everyone else looks like a decoration set. The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining . But the screenplay touches on the drama scenes so lightly that they do not create much justice to the film. The anarchic present looks like a throwback of Back to the Future II's Alternate . But all ends well at the conclusion, and people will find it likable, including those who read the book. By the way, this was the first time I heard about Kirsten Dunst... **/ out of **** Grade A Effects; This movie is the kind of movie you wouldn't want to watch when you're trying to get to sleep. This movie is lurking with action and adventure around every corner, along with some animals. Great effects, good plot, and interesting characters. A *** out of ****.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 forget the fussing; As a ++ female who married again only  years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at  AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached , God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the  teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his  years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life & Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau & Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman & John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a . out of  the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in , noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A() vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A() there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's , lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my -year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG- rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was  at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was --a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. / stars. Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from . The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment.  stars out of . Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter & Jack's previous films together. It was this film & the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max & John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the  adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. Classic sequel, better than st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the st --. out of  for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from . The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe yrs old, and must have seen it over  x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it  minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***/ (out of four) Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. One of the best movies of !; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having  or  scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about  minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as / Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT  out of  Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. / stars - John Ulmer More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in ,  years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie  out of . The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from  is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $ of the $ that I paid to see it. I give this one  out of . Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" Hilarious in Parts;  was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in , the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for  + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those  minutes back of my life. Please. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this  film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about  or  and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. A  is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT.

You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Great female flick of the 's!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track : This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no. and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops & horrible movies. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses.

Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in  at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four  something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker.  of  stars. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course % of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation.  \n",

   What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the  movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the  classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the  year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $k bonus to move out in  days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a , i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September ,  - Video Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part  right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part  still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part  is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part  is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. / Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. . out of  stars. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in . It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the  sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of . This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late ''s)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie.  "

    "In this project, the idea was to improve the predictions of movie ratings by using Natural Language Processing. Based on the results and evaluations of the models that we were able to complete on time. I feel like that has proven successful. \n",

    "While reviews and scores are generally subjective, there is a lot of nuance between what one person would rate something they describe as 'Amazing' or 'Terrible', which could explain our somewhat lackluster results on our final models. One of the issues addressed was that in the dataset, the features which were given was not well fit towards a regression model as it did not meet Homoscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of this, some next steps that will be implemented upon the completion of the program are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Revectorize the words in the review text, this time lowering the sentiment classification to a lower review score, this might produce more accurate negative keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incorporate web scraping techniques to add additional features from the IMDB website to movies with corresponding imdb_id's. We would attempt to find features more indicative of positive and negative ratings such as whether the actors or movies were nominated for awards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Including more advanced models such as XG boost\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use clustering techniques to find words that may have similar qualities with methods such as the BERT model.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, I found that I have learned a lot about the processes in data science through conducting this project. I hope this gave some valuable insight, and thank you for reading through the project."
