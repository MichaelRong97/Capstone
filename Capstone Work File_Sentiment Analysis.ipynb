       "      <td>Simply Brilliant; It doesn't matter whether you're young or old, this is a great movie. Woody is Andy's favourite toy and like all the other toys lives with the fear of being discarded when new toys arrive. He's therefore very worried when Buzz Lightyear arrives. Buzz is an instant hit with Andy and Woody is not very happy. To make matters worse Buzz doesn't think he is a toy and believes he is on a mission. The story really gets going when woody inadvertantly knocks buzz out of the house and the two of them end up with evil Syd who tortures toys. There's lots of adult humour meaning that the parents will find this as funny as the kids. The real winning combination of Toy Story is the characterisation and the empathy you can feel for the animated leads. Although they're not real this is one of the best buddy movies ever made. My personal favourite character is Mr Potato Head because of the dry humour. A classic 10/10 toy story; The original and the best. Woody and the gang have only fun and games until Buzz shows up and steals Woody's thunder. Woody is a pull-string cowboy and the leader of a group of toys belonging to a boy named Andy Davis. With his family moving away one week before his birthday, Andy is given a week-early party to spend with his friends, while the toys stage a reconnaissance mission to discover Andy's new presents. Andy receives a space ranger Buzz Lightyear action figure, whose impressive features see him replacing Woody as Andy's favorite toy. Woody is resentful, especially as Buzz also gets attention from the other toys. However, Buzz believes himself to be a real space ranger on a mission to return to his home planet, as Woody fails to convince him he is a toy. Not one of my favorites; After hearing about the success of the toy story series, a rented a DVD which had a collection of Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc. I loved Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2 but I did not enjoy Toy Story 1 even that much. These were the points that I didn't like in the movie: 1) In the starting, when Andy is shown playing with the toys, he starts to get a bit annoying after he keeps on playing with it. His love for the toys throughout the film bugged me after a while. But I did not find this too boring as even my cousin is a great fan of Spiderman and keeps buying and playing with the toys. 2) The animation looked a bit faded in the movie. But I didn't pay much attention towards it giving an excuse that it was made in 1995 and compared to Finding Nemo and the other new movies, its animation would be a bit duller. 3) Sorry Tom Hanks, but I found your character quite annoying in the film as you kept screaming like a mad character and I did not like you that much. 4) Woody's girlfriend in the movie had a terrible voice. I expected a cute shepherdess's voice to be more cute and sweet rather that being a bit rough and sounding like the second woman in a love story. 5) Mr.Potato head and the other characters, except for the spring dog, really annoyed me when they were reluctant to listen to Woody. I mean, why couldn't they just wait and understand him. 6) The bad boy removed some parts of his toys to make them look terrible. But towards the end, when the toys help Woody and Buzz, Woody thanks them and just leaves. Why didn't he tell the toys to leave that stupid place and run away with them? They should have included these characters in the second film, at least. 7) Toys had lives in the movie. So why did they not just start living alive with the humans? Why do they fall still when their masters came? They could play alive with them. The movie had some good points too. Here are some of them: 1) Tim Allen has done a fantastic voicing as Buzz, and I liked Buzz in the movie as he was shown brave, his voicing was done well and he didn't bore me at all. 2) The dog who supported Woody was cute and I liked him, just, I liked him, in the movie. 3) The movie was different from other movies, as here, toys were shown as the protagonists. 4) The dinosaur was funny and his character uplifted the film. Overall, I don't think it deserves to be in the top 250 movies. But its the people's choice and if they wish that it would be in the top 250, then I can do nothing but give my review on the film. One of the all time greats - but you know that already.; The toys of a small boy have their cosy lives thrown into disarray with the arrival of a new space toy, and the family's imminent move to another home... The first real mainsteam adult-friendly computer animated film. Actually the first real computer-animated film. Toy Story took a cutesy premise and made it believable with a very good storyline, excellent voice acting and amazing design, especially for the time even though this holds up exceptionally well now. More important than this is the longevity of the characters, you can have the prettiest backdrop and brightest colours going but if a kid doesn't like the characters in the thing it isn't going far. Go to a birthday party for any kid under 10 and you'll likely see a Buzz Lightyear or Woody the cowboy. More important this film can be watched and rewatched by anyone from 3 to 43 and there will be something to enjoy, again and again. As a side-note: My videoshop password was Woody for about 5 years thanks to this movie. What you hope kids will learn: Be good to your toys. What they'll take away: Space toys are cool. And Cowboy toys are cool. And Dog toys are cool. And I need one of those Dinosaur toys. Oh, oh, oh and a Mr Potato Head... And a Piggy! And... If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com \"Toy Story\" - The best computer animated film for good reason; As a child, have you ever wondered at one point in your life what might happen in your room full of toys while you weren't in it? In Disney- Pixar's landmark 1995 computer animated feature \"Toy Story\", we get that possible answer as the film is about toys that come to life while the owner is out of their room. In case you don't know why \"Toy Story\" is an important American film and why it's one of only two animated films to make the AFI's list of the 100 greatest films of all time, allow me to fill you in. It was the first full-length computer animated feature ever made and arguably the best in my opinion. \"Toy Story\" was so popular that it was responsible for initiating Pixar's big streak of success with other computer animated features such as \"Up\" (2009), \"WALL-E\" (2008), and \"The Incredibles\" (2004). In \"Toy Story\", a group of toys that belong to a young kid named Andy come to life while he's out of the room. They're all led by Andy's favorite toy, a cowboy doll named Woody (Tom Hanks). They've just learned that Andy and his family will be moving away to another neighborhood. Not only that, but his birthday party is being celebrated earlier than expected, which means new toys will be joining them for sure, much to the horror of the other toys. They're afraid that the new toys will be so cool that Andy will no longer want to play with them anymore. Despite this, Woody assures the other toys that everything will be alright and no one will be forgotten. That is until he discovers Andy's newest toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a space ranger action figure who thinks he's the real space ranger that he's based on. Woody becomes so jealous over how cool a toy he is that he tries to do whatever he can to become Andy's favorite toy again. When one of his attempts at getting noticed by Andy accidentally goes too far (meaning Buzz gets transported out of the house), Woody tries to rescue him and re-earn the trust of his fellow toys. But through a series of circumstances, Woody gets lost right alongside Buzz and they are accidentally found by Andy's next door neighbor, Sid. This is a problem for both of these toys since Sid enjoys torturing and destroying toys. So now Woody and Buzz must get over their differences and work together to get out of Sid's house and back to Andy before he moves. What we have here story wise is your typical buddy comedy in animated form, but it's done right. I'm not saying it just because it's told through a new form of animation, but because the film handles this type of story in an imaginative way. The basic plot seems to play out naturally and comes off as if Pixar was inventing this type of plot for the first time. There are no plot devices that are forced to the point where it's painfully obvious. Everything on screen works within the fabric of the story. The comedic bits, along with being humorous, are very well handled and are necessary contributions to the plot. I loved how in one scene when Woody talks to the toys in Andy's room from Sid's house, the other toys think that Woody murdered Buzz by the end of the scene. That scene and similar scenes were very funny and well done. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are irreplaceable as Woody and Buzz, respectively, since they bring so much to the chemistry and dialogue between each other to the point where it's impossible to top them. They do a great enough job with what they bring into each of their roles that you couldn't picture hearing any other actors play these two characters. The same can also be said for the supporting cast as well, particularly Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn as Rex. The actors do a convincing job at bringing each of their characters to life and putting enough personality into them that they help enhance the story further as good acting should be doing. The way Pixar handles its characters in this movie is also worth noting. For example, even though Sid is having fun destroying toys and is considered evil by the toys, they don't necessarily make him the main villain. In other words, the characters created here aren't exactly clear cut heroes and villains, but they're simply individuals with different personalities. Woody isn't a bad guy because he technically gets Buzz and himself into trouble, he's simply afraid of being forgotten by Andy. That aspect about Woody makes us relate to him even more since we do learn from the mistakes that Woody makes over this misunderstanding. Buzz Lightyear makes for an enjoyable fish-out- of-water type character in that he strongly believes he's the real Buzz Lightyear to the point that being told that he's actually a toy would be nonsense in his mind. Pixar truly cared a great deal about its story and characters here. As you can tell, \"Toy Story\" is more than an innovative American film with its groundbreaking animation or even an entertaining family film. It's a film about characters that I'm sure most of us can relate to or identify with. It's a film for everybody to cherish for different reasons whether it be the animation, the humor, the story or the characters. I'll argue that it's still the finest film Pixar's produced yet. In a pinch, \"Toy Story\" is a film you should definitely check out if you haven't already. one of if not the best animated films ever; Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen. The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer. The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen. The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year) respecting everything around you and never being to greedy or needy. Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come up with. This is a film, that not only can the kids enjoy but also the adults too. Great fun, a film that's not just for kids; I wasn't too sure about this film before I watched it. The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story. The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up  something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space! Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home. Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is 6 years old, but I've only just seen it!). The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others  such as Mr. Potato Head  are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep  who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries! The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back. Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible. The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films  particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations. All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again. And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them? Well, now we know why! A fantastic family film.; The plot:A wooden cowboy doll called Woody is a young boy's favourite toy, yet when his owner gets a space toy of an astronaut called Buzz Lightyear, Woody has been left out of his owner's daily live. Woody finds out that Buzz Lightyear thinks that he really is a space ranger.     Both toys are now fighting each other while being kidnaped by the next door nieghbour that hates toys and must work together to get back to their owner before they are destroyed. The view:A wonderful enchanting and nicely funny story about rivally between two toys that are animated very well, with the fact of the movie being the first that was computer animated, this movie is really for everyone that enjoys watching a film that the whole family will delight in. Great fun. **** I never really thought this was the best movie...; Toy Story is a good movie. It has good characters and a decent story. But is it really worth the hype? Yes, it's the first fully computer animated movie ever made and that's very impressive. For that reason alone, it will stand out in history. But I certainly never really thought it was the brilliant classic everyone else thought it was. Its animation is great but the story suffers from major pacing issues. There are entire moments of the movie right in the middle that bore me every time and don't stop boring me until I get to the film's climax, when it picks up again. A lot of trimming should have been done in the middle. Toy Story is good but its sequels are a lot better. So is it bad? No. But it's not brilliant. If this were 2-D, I doubt it would receive this high praise. One of the greatest animated movies ever created!; I don't want to be biast, but Toy Story is one of the greatest animated movies ever created. I first watched this movie at about 2-4 years old, and I loved this movie. The storyline is excellently written, and always gets me laughing! The animation in this movie is incredible! As a computer animated film it was well ahead of its era (at least I think). Also, it was the first feature length film that was fully animated, and to this day is one of the best. With the success of this film it was no wonder they made a sequel, one that i enjoyed a lot! Also, I have heard that Pixar have announced Toy Story 3, and it will be a movie I will definitely see! They Don't Call it \"Playing\" for Nothing.; The opening scene says it all. Film-making begins in early childhood, as children use their toys to create little scenes (or movies if you will). The word \"play\" when used to describe such activity indeed derived from the movies of another era, plays. Or perhaps the other way around. Either way, the point of this film is to show that creating a film and playing with toys are virtually the same thing. So the film is basically about itself. A play about playing. This is exactly the type of multi-layered construction that I believe subconsciously challenges and nurtures our kids' minds. Teaching a child (or adult!) to think on more than one level at a time is simply a gift. It should also be applauded that it's all substance and no fluff. Other animation teams have inundated their films with meaningless pop culture gags, camp, and nostalgic irony. Not to mention an abundance of toilet humor. Music by the great Randy Newman instead of the Village People. None of the mindless pandering to adults here, either, yet we are included in the fun by being subtly reminded of our own play days. Barrel of Monkeys. Potato Heads. In fact there is a strong undercurrent theme here as the classic cowboy toy is threatened by the flashy new space man who is obviously being pushed on kids via a relentless marketing campaign. We 30-somethings must root for Woody. It's Wal-mart vs. our favorite mom-n-pop corner store. These Pixar guys are brilliant, and I believe they will be revered someday as perhaps the most important influence in all of filmdom during the turn of this century's period. There is no more sure thing than a Pixar offering. Always compelling, engaging, intelligent and abstract. And this one is the best. Perfect film; Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only concern is easy when you can replace the new birthday and Christmas toys already there. Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, such a birthday, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new toy buzz lightyear. Competition buzz on the edge of the bed to hide, but accidentally pushes him out the window boil runs Woody, and Woody and buzz find a few other expulsion leaves them with no choice but to return her home. But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence. Typically, animation, Intelligence, humor and children's humor, the same mixture (Ice Age, monsters Inc, Bugs life, toy story is being used since it's easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out given how. I just watched it again and new twists on the formula than a little comes out. Each one is clearer and there seems to be more references in the background etc. However, it is still very funny and deserve credit for being the first of a successful formula. The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement. To the shores really what the main story is fun, but in terms of character development. When confronted with the truth of his status as a toy and nothing more against him, the conflict between buzz and Woody cartoon character, this is taken deeper,,, buzz the turmoil is very real. Two powerful support customers, despite the players a real depth. In fact, more rows, but may not have the funniest lines. 'Adult' Intelligence most of the potato head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky Dog. Funny and very used. In fact, the majority of the humor will go over kids heads, and the plot on the right. Looking back, this movie really must have helped sales so much in the movie toy companies on a sarcastic edge I feel. The marketing department behind this film it's not that hard to see standing rubbing his hands. However, the actual product quickly I forgot about this great fun. The voice work is excellent and the characters the players match. Allen woody and buzz for the B-type as he has a voice Hanks movie is good. His usual Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (), reckless, and all other support roles for adults turns out to be really good and probably the favorite characters. In general, this (if not more) as a classic film that will appeal to children as adults. A good plot and a very sharp short command already make time fly by. The only downside to want to go out and buy the damn things children! Best Disney ever; Finally a Disney movie which isn't moralistic but just fun to watch. Also it doesn't have the boring \"sing-along-songs\" so this movie is also a perfect movie for anybody about 10 years and (much) older. I really liked the computer-generated graphics because the characters moved very smoothly, something which can't be done the original way. More of these masterpieces in the future please and I will really like Disney at last, but dont't make it to moralistic and musical. That this movie is above all the other Disney -movies in the IMDB top 250 is proof of that. A wonderful family movie!; What a wonderful movie for the whole family to enjoy!  I can hardly wait for Toy Story 2 to come out! Great As The Other One!; This Toy Story is as great as the second one! I saw the second one first and it was really cool! Best Pixar movie to date!; Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (\"I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout\"). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox. If it wasn't for Toy Story coming together so well, computer animation would have taken a step backwards.; 9.4 For years, Disney reigned as the superior animation studio. Although there were others creating animated feature length films, Disney has always been a household name, known for their experience and ability to create an emotional and entertaining experience out of hand-drawn images, and original, composed music. In 1995, Pixar Animation Studios released Toy Story. While it wasn't the first time that we've seen CGI, or Computer Generated Imagery, it was the first fully CGI film. What a disaster this film could have been. And thank God that it wasn't. If it was, then it would have done more damage to CGI animation than otherwise. The film was distributed by Disney, but created by Pixar. It had no musicals. No frames were hand drawn, everything was done by computer. It had a lot to live up to. Sticking the Disney name on the film meant that audiences expected not a single drop of mediocrity out of it. Thankfully, as we all know, Toy Story was a success. The animation in the film isn't the augmented reality kind. CGI effects aren't added to real life shots, everything is animated. This gives the film some room to breathe. The lighting, surfaces and other effects all look good, in their own context. It would have been a huge step backwards for computer animation if Toy Story didn't come together so well, and successfully put up that fourth wall. But besides the animation, what brings to film to life is the voice- acting, story, and presentation. It's a story about toys who are conscious and self-aware. However, they all follow a strict code, where they do not allow humans to know of their life and intelligence. It's not an epic tale. Two toys are lost and have to get back home. But what carries the film are the characters. Every toy has a distinct personality, and the voice actors are great in their roles. This is one of the strong points in Toy Story. The film's presentation is great, too. It went totally contradictory of what Disney means to people. There are no musicals, but the music, although used sparingly, has a great effect nonetheless. The direction is of the more typical Hollywood style, and different from the typical Disney movie. It is entertaining to exist in the toys' world, and when they venture off a couple of blocks, you feel like you have traveled a long distance. Toy Story could have been such a disaster. If it wasn't for everything coming together so well, especially the animation, characters and voice acting, computer animation would have taken a step backwards. Its greatest strength are the toys. They are amongst the better characters in film. Toy Story not only proved that animated films can be done in a different formula than the already great Disney one, but that computer animation was here to stay. It was a pleasure to the eyes, and a pleasure to the Andy inside all of us. The cartoon that started it all.; I am not a kid but a kid at heart. Toy Story is one of the best animated movies around. This is the most creative movie for kids and adults. Toy Story 2 is better story than the first one, but equally imaginative in computer graphics. Tears....; Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library. The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in 1937 lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Awesome; A very sweet and fun movie. TOY STORY has great computer animation. A simple yet well told story is also added as well. The voice overs are top notch and everyone gets a fair share in this movie. PIXAR has done a good job placing itself on the map. Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle. Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel. A good rent. Classic Animation!!; Toy Story was the first fully animated movie that released in 1995. Starring Tom Hanks as Woody who brings life to the cowboy pull- string doll. Buzz Lightyear, played by Tim Allen brought the right attitude for the newest addition to Andy's (John Morris) toy collection. The story takes us back to the day where we played with toys and used our imaginations to create our own stories. When Andy would leave the room the toys would come to life. A week before Andy's birthday, with his family moving, he is given a party to spend with friends before they leave. The toys plot a way to discover Andy's new presents. After the party the other toys discovered Buzz is one of the presents Andy's receives before he leaves. The main theme of the story to me is \"friendship.\" It's a great story relaying the message to be kind to everyone because you never really know when you might need them and your enemy could be your best friend in the end. After all, \"You've got a friend in me.\" Woody doesn't want to lose top spot as favorite toy so he plots to get rid of Buzz. He starts with a master plan that leaves the both of them in a situation to help each other to get home. The rich colors and 3D animation gives the movie a more realistic feeling as if it were drawn. It is the lighting, modeling, computer graphics and animations are what bring this movie to life. The shading of certain objects, cracks or spills could be the difference between a human look or manufactured. The lighting had to be hard to create the film. They had some dramatic moody lights in Sid's room, flashlight stuff, daylight, bright sun for all sorts of different kinds of environments. When they add light it gives more a visual interest for viewers and hide some flaw in animation. Andy's room gives a sense of a happy, friendly and safe place because the brightness in the room gives that affect. This is an overall great film introducing a new way of animations! A Toy in the making of another and more toys; Excellent voice match to character in movie. Could have more art and less same images repeat. Pixar is now faster than ever; 1995 a slower speed for animated film. Will watch again, but not over and over again, consecutively. Liked it on Facebook, happy go lucky and not afraid to be bold. Don't understand the likes and dislikes but willing to accept all criticism. My own personal review may be liked or may be disliked. The clearness and accurate manner for beautiful taste in dual role models for example Sid the evil kid whom abuses toys and Andy the kid who doesn't like to play rough. However, Sid's sister is quite an opposite to Sid as well; she being a girl and has a love for tea parties with her closest doll Friends. The jokes and laughter in \"Toy Story\" is what made this turn of a century animated film a door-buster into the the first \"digital\" animated films in history. Of course, one does grow old and the story is great passed on to your children in just about any house hold! Toy Story; The story is about toys. The boy who named Andy has toys and enjoys playing with them. To be surprised, their toys can talk and act freely. Nobody of human know the fact. Woody who is Andy's cowboy toy spends a good time, however, Andy's new toy appear for Woddy. The toy's name is Buzz Lightyear. Woody and Buzz fight all the time and loses sight of their family and toys. They tries a lot of ways to meet their family and toys. The film is a long film by Pixar Animation Studious. The genre of the movie is animation, comedy and fantasy. It has dialogue and colors. It has sound effect and it is good to use the way of music. I like the scene that Woody and Buzz success in getting into a car that Andy rides. The film can be enjoyed by only children but also adults. You've got a friend in me; \"Reach for the sky\"! The opening statement of Woody (Hanks) a toy cowboy during a boys playtime. A statement that proves to be ironic when he later looks up at a toy from space, Buzz Lightyear (Allen). Woody's owner is growing older and Woody struggles to accept the change as Buzz becomes Andy's new favourite toy. Leading from the once strong leader into a bout of jealousy and even malice as he tries to take Buzz out of the picture. Woody is then separated from Andy via a fight with Buzz and has to find a way home. Further change occurs as Woody is forced to align with Buzz to escape the toy antagonist Sid. It takes 3/4 of the movie for Woody to finally change his ways, and work with Buzz for the final great escape. Woody's journey from leader to outcast to redemption is intriguing to watch unfold. His final monologue with Sid was beautifully written as the toy out wits the boy. The whole irony of his story is that a child's mind is fleeting and 10 minutes of playing with Buzz and Woody would have been in the game again. For me it is Buzz that follows the greater path of change. Noble and confident throughout mostly due to being under the illusion he is an actual space ranger. Kudos to the writer who decided to take a toy from this world and make him believe he is real! Simple but incredibly compelling. Buzz's final realisation that he is a toy is arm breaking for him but heartbreaking for us. For a family movie Buzz's breakdown is surprising and well delivered and the journey back to being he hero has Buzz literally \"Reaching for the sky\". With us the viewers figuratively as we are up there with them cheering the final events. Woody and Buzz's journey home is supported by a cast of toys, each with a filled out personality. Loyal Slinky being one of my favourites, always reluctant to turn on his buddy Woody like the others. It's the direction of John Lasseter that puts us into this world. When Woody shouts \"You are a toy\". It's John speaking to us. From the beginning the camera is at ground level. We are not supposed to be a child watching his toys come to life but an actual toy, low level shots panning up throughout give a feel to the vastness of a toys world. We are right there through each playtime, adventure, triumph and failure and by the end Buzz may be flying but we are falling for these toys, in style. The story and characters are a success but the triumph is the medium in which the story is told. Through 3d animation, never before seen feature length. The Pixar animators made a bedroom and a pizza planet truly realistic. They brought toys to life in movement and texture. But most astonishing of all, they made us care for a bunch of 3d shapes put together through countless hours of rendering in a computer. The result is a metaphor for change, not just in the story itself and it's characters but in the medium it is told. The great change from 2d to 3d animation which is now common place for feature animation. This movie is a game changer for cinema and animation alike. Walt Disney and co did it in 1938. 54 years later John Lasseter and co did it again. The possibilities for 3d animation in film are Infinite, and Beyond...? this movie is awesome!the humor never bores!; i remember when this movie came out in 1995. i was seven at the time. i have loved it since day 1. actors such as tom hanks and tim allen bring sparkle to the show. they are both hillarious as woody and buzz. this movie is directed at both kids and adults. the humor never goes flat and it is never cheesy or corny. if you are a fan of tom hanks and tim allen or you just want a good laugh, than you shoud definitely watch this movie. you will not regret it. ********** out of **********. In my top 25; Although i like to think the 3rd is the best, everyone should respect this film, the first feature film to be animated, and still holds up as one of the best! And not to mention being in the top 250, thats a accomplishment! this film will forever stay with me as a Nostalgic relic, i only hope that newer generations will remember this film as i do. I still like to think of this as my favorite film of all time, if anyone was to ask me, usually because i can't think of one i'd rather be proud of saying i love it so much, or maybe i'm a total hipster? This film for me is a 8/10, not as perfect as the 3rd, but good enough for any Pixar fan. An Entertaining Accomplishment; This movie is one of the real achievements of the modern age, and a real measure of how good is the fact that you quickly forget your amazement at the computer animation and just get the story. We signed up to buy it the first day they had pre-orders and have enjoyed it since - and we didn't have kids then! A rare combination of many things that can be enjoyed by everyone.  I can't believe anyone would rate it less than a 9! A MUST HAVE! It's a Happy Movie! Ya there's spoilers; I put this computer animated movie just on the cusp of being great. You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time...8.7/10 This DVD is part of the Toy Story 2 Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages. Quality animation always looks good on the big screen and this looks wonderful. This is a Buy and Hold to flesh out your collection to include 'Happy Movies' as my daughter puts it. The DVD is a solid 9/10 Toy Story; A wonderfully sculpted piece of filmmaking. It brings us into a new age and may this new age have films that are just as delightfully witty as this pleasing film for all ages. The laughs are constant, there's great creativity at work, from the artists and the numerous talents who lend their voices. Hanks, Allen, Rickles and Ermey stand out in their performances. An unmissable film; From our first sight of Woody until his happy face disappears off of the screen the makers of this film keep audiences worldwide glued to the screen with eager anticipation. The films unlikely scenario where talking toys battle to save a fellow toys life is amazingly gripping and a \"must see\" which will keep the whole family (yes even the teenageers) amused. The more mature audience will recognise the \"spoofy\"side to the movie. This is most noticeable when plastic soldiers (who mimic the actors in \"Who saves wins\") jump off  bannisters with miniature parachutes and talk to each through baby monitering systems.!!! In conclusion, TOY STORY is one of the most thought out films in the industry as props and scenerycan not just be found lying around and everything had to be individually designed, crafted and computerised The Best Animated Movie of All Time; 1995's Toy Story is a work of pure imagination. It covers topics of fantasy, friendship and jealousy. It also contains relatable characters which shines out compared to other animated films. The actors were perfectly cast (Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz - the list goes on...) and the intricate plot can be compared to some of the best movies ever. I think everyone in the world has seen Toy Story, but if you haven't, it's a must see. Its by far superior to its two sequels, but they are decent. Not only is it a great film, it is historically significant, as it was the first fully 3D animated film. You HAVE TO SEE THIS... J My favorite film as a kid and remains a classic today; As a kid, I remember watching the first two Toy Story films frequently and collecting all the characters from the movie. I found out that it was the very first computer-animated film about two years ago and assumed that's why the movie is still so popular. Woody and Buzz are what made the film what it was then and today and were my favorite characters. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is where Woody and Buzz are launched in the air from the rocket and Buzz frees himself to fly into Andy's toy box. The film remains a classic and always will be to me. I also cannot wait for the third movie to come out June 18, 2010 because I'll be the first in line. A resounding success; Pixar knocks it out of the park with its first feature film, about friendship, jealousy and the capriciousness of privileged white kids in a society of disposability. A clever, sharp and imaginative screenplay expertly voiced by a stellar cast (I would give this 5/10 just for casting Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head) keeps the swiftly moving story engaging throughout, flagging only a bit when self- deluded toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is briefly depressed. The film hops from one great set-piece to the next with head-spinning speed that leaves me marveling at how simple director John Lasseter and the team of animators make it look to bring these toys to life with just a few touches of individuality. Every viewer will probably have their favorite parts. Back when I first saw the movie upon its initial release, mine was the new-age toys who worship the Claw; upon recent viewing, I think it is \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" rendition of evil neighbor Sid's bedroom. It's hard to remember now that Pixar has proved so successful that there was real doubt about whether its style of computer-graphics animation would be embraced by audiences -- kudos to Pixar for proving the doubters wrong. Very good!; As much as I enjoyed this film, I think the sequel was even better. One can certainly relate to Woody's jealousy of Buzz, and cheer when they've found the perfect best friend. I loved it when all the toys put evil Sid in his place, and I'm even happier that Sid wasn't in the sequel! Best of all is that Woody and Buzz never give up. Great animation and voice-overs! Exciting; Toy story is a 1995 American computer-animated adventure buddy comedy film produced by Pixar Animetion Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures, directed by John Lasseter at his directorial debut. Toy story was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first theatrical film produced by Pixar. In the film, toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present. A group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy, are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother and his sister are preparing to move the following week. The toy's leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Woody organized the other toys. Andy gets an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear as a birthday present. He believes that he is an actual space ranger. What happen to Andy's toys next? The characters have individuality. The picture on the screen is colorful, so I think the film is very cute. I am excited because I think about what happen next and what Andy's toy do next. I love the film's view of the world. Everyone enjoys the film, regardless of age or sex. I want you to watch the film. The one that started it all; In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In 1995, they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be 100% made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history. The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having \"souls\" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was. Rating: 9,5/10 The Beginning of a Classic Trilogy.; Toy Story came out on 1995 and it got 2 more sequels Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3. Story: Woody, a traditional pull-string talking cowboy, has long enjoyed a place of honor as the favorite among six-year-old Andy's menagerie of toys. Quick to calm their anxieties about being replaced by newer arrivals, Woody finds his own confidence shaken, and his status as top toy in jeopardy, upon the arrival of Buzz Lightyear, simply the coolest space action figure ever made. Woody plots to get rid of Buzz, but things backfire and he finds himself lost in the outside world with Buzz as his only companion. Joining forces to find their way home, the two rivals set out on an adventure that lands them in the clutches of Sid, a sadistic neighborhood kid who is notorious for dismembering and reassembling \"mutant\" toys in his bedroom. As \"guests\" of Sid and his dog, Scud, the two fugitive toys forge a genuine friendship and learn that only through mutual trust and respect do they have any chance of survival. Toy Story is one of the best animation movies ever made full of laughs and drama with a great cast voicing the stars and a great script and direction it's easy to say that Toy Story is still one of the best movies ever made and for sure a Classic. An amazing family film; Toy Story is a timeless classic. Probably the most genuine, innocent, simplistic yet powerful attempt to create a children film which appeals both adults and kids alike. It is the story of how two rival 'living' toys - a old western cowboy toy (Woody) and action figure of a space commander (Buzz Lightyear) become best friends under some dangerous circumstances. There are bunch of numerals toys like Mr. Potato, a Barbie, a magnifying toy, a truck, alien toys and many more. The film is crafted so well that within some few minutes of the film, you are intrigued to it. It is a fascinating film, with amazing characterization. The toys are so believable that you feel close to them. You feel cherished when Allan and his company make a spoiled brat kid Sid (who loves blowing up toys) realize how important is to save toys which bring back the memories of childhood. I must say the script is effortless and very well written. Music by Randy Newman is also great. One striking thing in this film are its sound effects and CGI which are considered ground-breaking for a 1995 film. Overall, the film is highly recommended. Not only for children, but for everyone who love cherishing the childhood memories - the lovely Toys. Toy Story and the Imagination; The film Toy Story is an animation film that changed the movie game with its technological advances used to create this bold, colorful computerized animation. Toy Story is about a boy named Andy and his love for his toys. Andy's favorite toys have a huge secret that he is not aware of, they are actually alive and become real when no one is around. Andy has a favorite toy cowboy named Woody who is the Sheriff and leader of all the other toys. Woody pride himself on being Andy's favorite toy, but that title is challenged when Andy has a birthday party and receives a new space ranger toy Buzz Light Year. In the scene that introduces Buzz Light Year, it is kind of symbolic that the new toy may be a replacement for the old cowboy Woody. As the kids rush in the room the day of Andy's birthday party Woody is thrown under the bed, and Buzz Light Year is placed on the bed in Woody's spot. Time goes by as Randy Newman's song \"You got a friend in me\" plays as the soundtrack during various scenes as Andy becomes more involved with Buzz, eventually pushing Woody to the background. The lyrics to the song could be considered an ironic montage to the mood that Woody feels during these scenes, because he is lonely and feels replaced. Buzz on the other hand is indulging in the admiration that he receives from Andy. The soundtrack to this movie as awesome, because the lyrics of the songs played like, \"you got a friend in me\", \"strange things\", and \"pop goes the weasel\". Those songs can replace the dialogue in the scenes and the audience will still be able to follow on. At Pizza Planet there is some tension between the two toys Buzz and Woody, which causes them to end up with the neighbor kid Sid, who is known to destroy his toys. Once the movie reaches this climax the characters positions change. Woody and Buzz are forced to reconcile and work together in the quest to return home. The special effects and graphics used in this animation were phenomenal. The camera angles, digital character movements, even facial expressions, helped bring the toys in the film to life. Although this film theme was surrounded by the dynamic relationship between alpha toys Woody and Buzz Light Year. The supporting characters, the relationships displayed between Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, the comedic scenes with Rex the Dinosaur and Slinky the Dog made the film more entertaining and realistic. Toy Story is a must see film for all children who has a love for toys. Watching this film will enhance a new found respect for the creativity of children's imagination. Great film about toys; Toy Story is the first fully computer-animated film. It tells the story of a cowboy toy named Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) who is jealous when a new toy arrives, Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen). Buzz thinks he's a space ranger, and is eventually \"disposed of\" accidentally by Woody. (Woody had only meant to knock Buzz behind a dresser) Woody and Buzz eventually become friends, and had it not been for that friendship, Buzz would have been . . well, I'll let you see it yourself. Toy Story, while a great film, is the only Pixar to not be among my Top 10. But still, I think it's worth watching. It may not be log enough, but not all good movies have to be 2-3 hours long. My Score: 9/10 One or two?; I have no idea which is the best, as depending on my mood either one suits me. This for my money is best for its darker aspects, Sid, Buzz and Woody's rivalry etc.       This film is not only groundbreaking with effects, but raised the bar with its smart script and proper characters. Deserves all the praise. Animation's \"Citizen Kane\"; A technological breakthrough (the first entirely digital animated feature), John Lasseter's comedy would be astonishing if only for the realism of the film's design. But Lasseter and his writers (there are six others who get credit) have fashioned a screenplay simple in story line but complex in structure and emotion; it's also rollickingly funny with a spate of memorable lines that have real depth to them. As two beloved toys vying for their owner's affection, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are splendid--they join forces with Lasseter's formidable crew to make their characters come completely alive. You feel as if you know them thoroughly by the conclusion and are moved by the life lessons they've learned, lessons you would want any child to learn. In addition to the main performers, the voice cast is perfectly suited to the toys they're called upon to represent: there's Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, the late Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex, the timid dinosaur, Annie Potts as Bo Peep and John Ratzenberger as Hamm, the talking pig. Laurie Metcalf is the voice of the child's mother. A supreme accomplishment, you can watch it over and over again and still find something new every time--it's animation's \"Citizen Kane\". The one that started it all with Pixar; In 1995 a man named John Lasseter set up his own company called Pixar which was also owned by the late Steve Jobs. So their first film was of course Toy Story. Everyone has seen this movie before its probably the best Pixar movie to date since the mid 1990s. The story is about Woody the cowboy(voiced by Tom Hanks)who is a toy along with many other toys that come to life when no one is in the room. All of the toys are owned by Andy a young boy who lives with his mom and his sister. So on the eve of Andy's birthday he ends up getting a new toy,the Buzz Lightyear toy which is a very popular toy who is a space ranger. So when Woody is introduced to Buzz Lightyear(voiced by Tim Allen)Woody ends up being jealous of him and he would do anything to be the center of attention again. But when a rough kid who lives next door accidentally gets Woody and Buzz out of a cash rending machine its up to Woody and Buzz to escape Sid's house. Overall this was a very original authentic masterpiece. The story is very good,the music is great,the charcthers are engaging and the whole set up is fantastic. Its a shame it didn't win an Oscar but at least the 2010 prequel to it won Best Animated Feature beating the likes of Tangled and How To Train Your Dragon. 9/10 Best Toy Story Movie; This movie is funny, hilarious, humorous1 It makes the whole wide world wanna laugh! This movie is so funny, you'd laugh your butt off! I liked it how Sid scared his sister but messing up her toys. I wish I can do what he does to the Animal Crossing players! They make me sick because they suck more than Justin Bieber. Also, it's funny how Woody murdered Buzz! Also Bo Peep reminds me of Princess Peach from the Super Mario series. She should have appeared in the other Toy Story movies. I can't believe they screwed up on Toy Story 3, one of the worst Toy Story movies ever! I hope they don't ever screw up Toy Story 4, which comes out next year. Amazing; This movie has something for everyone in the family. It is funny, has action, has a life story, and the characters will touch your heart. These are not just toys, this is a friendship, siblings, relationship or just a way of thinking sometimes. It is a real story on so many levels. It is a heart-warming story about a child and his toys and the relationships between the toys. In Toy Story, the two main characters are Buzz and Woody. At first Buzz and Woody can not stand each other and the two of them fight for the love of their owner Andy. Throughout the story these two show that fighting, arguing, and not getting along will get you no where in life and finally come together to help each other get back to their owner so that they can get back to their home. After all the trials and tribunals these two go through they become the best of friends and go on for two more movies to be a heroic team. Great Movie; All kids should watch this movie. It is very Funny. All the characters remind me of how good times growing up. The animation was before its time. All the toys are very courageous and dominating. Most animation movies could not keep my attention around this time, but this movie most definitely kept my eyes glued to the screen and my bottom in my theater chair. Approving each other; I watched this movie when I was an elementary student for the first time. That time, I only thought that toys are cute, or something like that. However, this film contains moral meaning, and I have not realize it until I become an adult. This film tells us the importance of things. These days, people have many things. It means we are rich. However, it's only the abundance of objective things. In toy story, a boy with many toys but does not have heart to treat toys dearly is suppose to be punished. This suggests the situation of modern society, and reminds us the importance to treat things carefully. Another point that I like in this film is, the growth of the cowboy. When he meets Buzz for the first time, he did not accept Buzz, because he couldn't understand everything about Buzz. Moreover, his position was taken over because of Buzz's appearance. However, he learns the importance of understanding other people, through the adventure to return to home. Also, Buzz finally comes to understand Woody. This means that we can understand each other even if the existence is in contrast. Good and groundbreaking; Good and groundbreaking computer animation graphics movie that delivers but does not reach a higher level due to the animation itself not having the \"warmth\" of the drawing style classic Disney animations.Still,the computer style here is very promising and quite impressive.Good story and script.A good solid start in a new trend in animation production.Very good voice acting.Only for fans of kids movies..... The Largest Part Of My Childhood Put On Screen.; With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. \"Toy Story\" was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises &amp; confidence. How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history. I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling &amp; technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals &amp; entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks &amp; Tim Allen, and almost immediately think \"Toy Story\". As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then. Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, \"Toy Story\" is that proof. 10/10. Toy Story was like the Snow White of 1995; I remember going and seeing Toy Story when I was 5 years old at the movies. I fell completely in love with it! It had great animation, great characters and a great story! My favorite character was the Slinky Dog played by my favorite comedian the late Jim Varney (God rest his soul). I loved it towards the end when Slinky is trying to get Woody and Buzz into the moving van and the others toys in the moving van pull on him so hard that he begins to stretch out! That was hilarious! I also liked it when Slinky says Come on PotatoHead! If Woody says it's all right well darn it it's good enough for me! Woody has never stared us wrong before! With Toy Story PIXAR showed us what Computer Animation could do to tell a great story! Toy Story like Snow White it an animated classic that'll go on forever! I'm hoping one day to get a job at PIXAR and I think Walt Disney would of been proud of what they've done with Toy Story and Computer Animation. God bless you Pixar Animation Studios! Great fun for anyone; Toy Story is definitely a film that a kid should watch before they are a teen. Its adventure and great sense of humour is appealing to adult audiences as well, and the atmosphere is brilliant. This really is a Toy Story. The plot is indeed quite simple, and it would have to be for a classic family. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks)is a toy 'sheriff' doll, owned by a young boy called Andy. Woodys Toy life couldn't as Andy loves him a lot, but as Andy's birthday party arises tension fills the bedroom with each toy living in fear of being replaced. Everything goes well till the last birthday present is opened.. enter Buzz Lightyear! I would be criminal to tell you the rest of the story, but as far as humour and adventure are concerned, this film impresses in both categories. The toys different personalities really contrast and make you laugh, from the smart-chat of Mr. Potatoe head, to Slinky who is Woodys best toy friend. Its so easy to follow this film - the plot and characters are easy to watch the computer graphics are top notch. Compared to modern day CGI kids films, this stands out purely because of its innocence - a simple story, theirs no techno-babble, and its really fun. This truly is the film of the Nineties! Toy Story; This was the very first computer animated film from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation, it is just excellent. It is showing what happens when the young Andy leaves his room, his toys come to life! Woody the cowboy is Andy's favourite toy, and looks after all the other toys (and he is a very good Tom Hanks voicing). Unfortunately on Andy's early birthday party he gets a new favourite toy, Buzz Lightyear the space ranger (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody obviously gets jealous and both him and Buzz end up lost, and then in evil Sid's room. For a kid, Sid is a good villain. Woody and Buzz are now trying to find a way to get back to their owner. Also starring Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Jim Varney as Slinky, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Morris as Andy, Scream 2's Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom, Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Army Sarge and Jeff Pidgeon as Green Aliens.With recognisable toys for every generation, and the Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song \"You've Got a Friend\" and Oscar nominated music by Randy Newman, this is a great family film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and a Special Achievement Award (fior creation of a feature-length computer-animated film), it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, along with the sequel, both was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons, and it was number 40 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding! Great start to a great trilogy; The beginning of a sensational trilogy , I think this is the weakest of the trilogy , more does not mean it is bad , quite the contrary , it's great movie, who would say that dolls speakers would so sure , the history of this is great , it's funny , the double Woody and Buzz is very good at the beginning Woody has envy him to be best friends, Sid movie villain is cruel , you feel a giant hatred for him , we have other characters , the soundtrack is excellent, the voice work is amazing , the brilliant Tom Hanks who is the voice of Woody , Woody scene trying to escape from Sid's house is very good and fun (remember some prison movies) , Toy Story is a classic animation, and deserves to be seen by all. Note 8.8 Lost a vote cuz it was too short!!; I want to get the recently re-released anniversary edition because this is a must have for any collection, be it animation or just good movies! What an absolutely funny, original and mesmerizing movie! I mean, come on, what kid in the history of the world doesn't, at some time, think their toys are alive. That's why girls talk to Barbie or have tea parties with all the toys, and guys chat with GI Joe and make believe the hot wheels can talk! Let's not even bring up our puppets! Pixar and Disney not only knock our socks off with the most amazing computer generated animation, but the writers of this story hit a home-run and totally captured the whimsical innocence of what we all knew was going on when we were kids; that our toys are alive and only want to be played with and cherished. In addition, the superb voice acting by a cast of actors that obviously still remember being a kid, only gives this instant classic the status of being the \"Gold Standard\" to which all others in this category will have to be judged. My only complaint and why I only give 9 out of 10, is that it is far, far too short, running 1 hour and 20 minutes! I know I'm selfish, but I want MORE!! I could and would have watched 2 or 3 hours of this! But that's why there's a Toy Story 2!! Wonderful animated feature...; TOY STORY is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. It goes along with TOY STORY 2, TARZAN, A BUG'S LIFE, THE LION KING and CHICKEN RUN as some of my favorite animated features. Tom Hank s voices Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll owned by a boy named Andy who is the most-played toy until a space ranger, Buzz (Tim Allen) comes along and Woody is not good friends with them. But one day later, a mean toy-hating man who owns a collection of mutant toys and tries to threaten Buzz, and it is up to Woody to save Buzz with the help of the mutants before it's too late to escape to Andy's new house. The sequel is better than the original, but TOY STORY is a good movie. **** An Instant Classic!; After a few short films and no major recognition-in 1991, Pixar set out to start the ball rolling for computer-animated entertainment and in 1995 unleashed not just a mere film but a work of art. An instant classic when first released...Toy Story went on to earn nearly $400 million worldwide and capture the hearts of children and adults alike with its unforgettable characters, magical musical score, hilarious script and the classic quote \"To infinity and beyond\". Woody (Tom Hanks) is an old-fashioned pull - string cowboy doll living a life of luxury as the favourite toy of a young boy named Andy. Surrounded by a colourful cast of characters - such as the cynical Mr. Potato Head, the wisecracking Piggy bank Hamm and Woody's brown-nosing second-in-command Slinky Dog - Woody seems something of a king. However, when a new toy arrives on the scene-a high tech spaceman action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Woody suddenly loses his popularity. But this toy comes with a surreal extra feature - he thinks he's the real Buzz Lightyear!! In the effort of removing Buzz as Andy's favourite toy-both toys are swept out of their home, and into the outside world where they unite reluctantly in friendship for an adventure home. Toy Story; This movie came out around the time I was born. And I especially remember watching this and Toy Story 2 (the sequel) like every day. And I remember getting sucked in to a world I'd like to live in. A world were my toys came to life. In my mind, this movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250 list. This is a movie everyone can enjoy. This is definitely Disney Pixar's best movie. Although Monster's Inc., The Incredibles, Cars, Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, and Meet the Robinsons are great. It does not come close to the magic Toy Story brings. If you have not yet seen Toy Story, where the hell have you been? It's a fantastic movie, and my favorite. So if you haven't seen it yet...Then what are you waiting for....GO!! yup; The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy). The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing. I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had. Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made  something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.' Not only for children under 10 !; I saw this really cool animated movie and I really liked it. Buzz LIGHTYEAR and WOODY didn´t get along much in that movie, but together they mastered their way out of danger. I am really looking forward seeing part two of this film. Really good animation, with almost real looking sequences, the scene with the rocket and the remote-control buggy, when BUZZ and WOODY chasing the van is really fast´n furious. Check it out, it´s worth watching it. I thought it was George CLOONEY, as the voice of BUZZ, it sounded similar, but it was Tim ALLEN. Solid entertainment for the kids...; Great animation, great voice cast. A wonderful film for children, but as an adult, I thought there was a total lack of any good jokes. All the songs seemed unnecessary and the story was pretty weak for a film so hailed by adult critics. But the 3D animation is really groundbreaking, my jaw hit the ground several times, and that's what this film is all about. ****(out of five) A Triumph For Disney!; \"Toy Story\" has been said to be the first great fully computer animated feature ever.  And I must agree.  Computer animation has been used before, in movies like \"Tron.\"  But only in \"Toy Story\" has it been used with such great effect.  Seeing animation like this is impressive.  Truly cinematic history was made with this movie!  The technology may be improving past the level it had achieved when \"Toy Story\" was made.  But you just can't forget this milestone! It's okay but over hyped; I saw Toy Story in theaters when it first came out and it was alright but I wasn't impressed. Over the years I've come to dislike it rather than feeling neutral toward it. The concept of the movie wasn't new to me because I had already seen the Jim Henson film The Christmas Toy which was basically the same but instead of Woody the cowboy being the main character it was a tiger plush toy named Rigby and I prefer puppetry over CG anyway. Given that this movie was made in the early days of CG the people look really weird and fake, almost creepy, even the good characters. It seems to mainly focus on the petty squabbles between the jealous cowboy and the delusional spaceman. While the film has a few jokes the kids might not get, my over all impression is that the whole story lacks depth. You could maybe read between the lines and infer things but the movie glosses over most of the more serious stuff to keep the mood light. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable either. Toy Story; Total Classic Disney movie, One of the best ever made in my opinion! Long loved by adults and children alike! Its a great animation about....(well if the title didn't give it away) Toys, And their adventures while in the care of Andy, a young boy who's favourite toy used to be sheriff Woddy (voiced by Tom Hanks)a cowboy doll, until one day on his birthday he receives a space doll, Buzz lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) Woody isn't too happy when he finds he has been replaced by a space toy and immediately holds a grudge over Buzz. Woody is surprised to find out that this 'Space Toy' doesn't even know he is a toy, And wouldn't believe it if you told him. Fed up over being replaced Woody tries to dispose of Buzz, the plan fails of course...but it starts Buzz and Woody on an adventure of a lifetime...or 'toytime'...which eventually brings them close together! Must see for all Disney Fans! Infinity and beyond from Disney and Pixar!; Disney and Pixar studios team up and brought us an imaginative adventure story about a little boy named Andy who loves playing with his toys, with his best friend being a cowboy doll named Woody. However, when Andy and not body else is looking, the toys come to life. Woody is the leader of the toys in Andy's room, which include a Mr. Potato Head, Slinky the Dog, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Pig and Bo-Peep the girl doll. However, when Andy's get new toy space ranger Buzz Lightyear for his birthday, Buzz takes the place of Woody of being leader of the toys and Andy's new best friend. Brewing with jealously, Woody attempts to get rid of Buzz, but both ended up lost outside of Andy's house. As a result, they must find their way back to Andy's house before they move - first trying to get through Andy's weird neighbor and toy torturer Sid. This is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation - very detailed and realistic. The story is full of surprises and adventure, from Woody and Buzz getting lost in a pizza shop to them trying to break loose out of Sid's house to get back to Andy's. The movie is also filled with comedy; you will have to watch the movie to appreciate and understand the humor only live toys could make. And, there are toe-tapping songs you would learn to love including Randy Newman's opening song \"You've Got a Friend in Me.\" While this movie's plot is full of non-stop fun and adventure, making every moment exciting and entertaining, the film also concentrates on friendship and teamwork and overcoming all odds. While I mostly enjoyed this movie, I wished that Woody was not made out to be hated on so much by the other toys after Woody's jealous behavior towards Buzz. I thought this takes away at Woody's hero status too much especially for his first movie. But overall, this is one of Disney's best work, which will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination. Also, hands down to a great voice cast: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts and Jim Varney. Grade B+ One of the great movies of all time; I enjoy watching this movie over and over. It is structured so carefully, I can pick up from any point and be immersed. I love reading about how it was made just as much as watching it, and collect books about Pixar and the making of these films. But as much as I enjoy the craft and history of Toy Story, I also think it deserves credit for its influence. It's just too bad that all the filmmakers that think they're working from the Toy Story template are missing the main ingredient: story. Pixar worked and reworked this script for years and refused to quit until they got it right. Woody and Buzz, Pizza Planet, Andy's Bedroom, Sid--I only wish I had appreciated it for what it was upon its release. But I get it now. And I will be there for whatever this company does next. A great start for good old Pixar; The story is quite predictable, but at least it makes up with the heart and execution. The animation, while dated now, was great for its time. The characters are memorable and lovable So overall, nice job Pixar. The Best Animated Movie; This is probably the best animated movie I've ever seen. The story-line and the pace of the movie keeps you pretty engaged. Tom Hanks as Woody is simply the best character introduced in an animated movie. I think should do more voice-overs. And the 2 sequels are also very good. IT'll surely bring back your childhood memories. It's a pure entertainer. Hands Down My Favorite Disney FIlm.; I just recently saw the Toy Story, Toy Story 2 double feature and it was amazing seeing this movie on the big screen after all this time. In my opinion this is the best movie Pixar has made so far, and it will be hard to top it. The animation is flawless and all of the characters are so lovable, you actually forgot that they are toys and not real people. The plot is actually really inventive and the idea of toys being jealous of one another is really fun. I think this movie is perfect for people of any age because the humor can be enjoyed by anyone. Obviously it's the perfect movie for kids, but it's great for adults too. Tim Allen and Tom Hanks lend their voices as the main characters in this film, and they are perfect in it. Overall, this movie is genuine animated classic! \"You've Got A Friend in Me...\"; I literally can't stop singing every time I hear Randy Newman play one of the greatest songs of all time. Anyway, Toy Story is one of the my all-time, no-holds barred, #1 movies of i've ever seen . Toy Story begins when Andy gets a new toy called Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen) and a bitter rivalry between Woody(Tom Hanks)and Buzz ensues. After a trick to get Buzz Lightyear stuck between a drawer goes terribly wrong, Woody knows that he can't show his face back in Andy's room without Buzz Lightyear. After an unhappy reunion at the Gas Station and a misadventure at Pizza Planet, Woody and Buzz are soon kidnapped by a sinister kid named Sid Phillips. Now, Woody and Buzz must reconcile and together, they will either think up a plan to get out of the Sid's house or be doomed under the filthy hands of the crazy kid himself. Also starring Jim Varney(From \"Hey Vern, It's Ernest!\" and all the Ernest movies) as Slinky and Don Rickles(From \"Dennis the Menace Strikes Again\" and \"Beach Blanket Bingo\") as Mr. Potato Head, Toy Story will not only have you rolling on the floor laughing, it will warm your heart. This movie is so passionate, so comical, and so heart-warming, that it spawned off two great sequels beloved for generations to come. I definitely recommend this movie to Toy Story lovers everywhere! Awesome Animated Movie!; Toy Story 3 may not be the best animated movie ever, but this is still one of them, beats the crap out of that crappy Wall-E! Anyway, it follows Woody and the toys, Woody gets jealous of Buzz Lightyear, their owners new favorite toy which of replaced Woody. Woody knocks Buzz out the window, and the other do the same to Woody because of what he did to Buzz. They both fall, then they go over to Andy's moms van, and they hitch a ride. They end up at the gas station, fight, and take the Pizza Planet car. They get there, get stuck in a toy machine with some rubber aliens, and the mean kid, Sid, gets them. And he takes them to his house, where he tortures them. And now we have our movie, did I mention the people don't know the toys are alive? No, well they don't. And this movie as amazing animation, it's perfect. Highly recommend this amazing animated movie. Ground Breaking Animation!; Toy Story is hands down the best animated film of all times. It's also a groundbreaking film with computer animation and it allowed more movie producers to explore the art. Fortunately that did happen because nowadays animated movies are staples in movie making. This is about a toy cowboy named Woody who is the favorite toy of his owner, Andy. He gets jealous when Andy gets a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. It only gets worse when both of them are missing and get stuck in evil Sid's room. The voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are probably the best well-known voices in animated films. The music by Randy Newman is fantastic. The songs and score alike are fantastic and memorable. Overall, this is the best animated film of all times and it spawned two very good sequels. I rate this film 10/10. Perfect! A badge to be worn proudly by Pixar.; Of course my opinion, but truly,honestly perfect! It is an amazing standalone, kid, and Pixar film with all the great motifs of all. It teaches children good values about who are in the world, and mortality. It also appeals to all ages and has incredible animation for 1995, and also was great enough to be unforgotten all the way until now 2015, 20 years later. Buzz's realization that he is just another product to be sold in the world, is in my opinion, one of the greatest moments of movie and entertainment history. The movie gives you a lot of things to speculate on like is Woody a bad toy? Or can a movie have virtually no villain but the hero or at all? The choice is 100% yours and that is what I love most about the movie. It is absolutely timeless and unforgettable and I highly suggest watching it.  This movie was one of the best 3d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an 8.5.(I gave it an 8) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of 3d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! The first full length CGI movie; Toy Story has become at the time of that recording 21 years old. Twenty One!! This the most influential animated movie since Snowwhite and the Seven Dwarfs, which is the every first full length movie and it came out in 1937!! OK to pull myself together ,I am pretty sure that the majority of you, who read this is under 18 and can not think of a time before all animated movies used CGI. And the amazing part is almost everyone though that Toy Story would be flop and their luck of faith, although disturbing, was way off. Also the characters like Woody, Buzz, Rex and the rest of the gang have rooted in pop culture and its sequels are awesome in their own right. In all honesty I cannot choose which of the three is better I love them all equally. To summaries Toy Story is one of the best family flick ever made and you should show it to your kids and maybe re-watch, yourself dear writer, all the trilogy with the Toy Story 4 coming out in 2017!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Wonderful adventure; My opinion: Do not underrate this movie that much. I didn't particularly like it - in fact I almost forgot about it for many years - but the story is simply very, very smart. The idea behind the plot is utter genius. Okay, the actual transformation did not work perfectly, but I insist that it was still a straight accomplishment that had 1. a nice cast, 2. sustainable visual effects and achievements, 3. a great story, 4. both funny and entertaining sequences, that even made you pause and think sometimes, which I regard as a major attainment of any movie. So - I'll give it a solid 7, which it deserves at least. Considering it has Robin Williams in it, it is okay.; I am not really a huge fan of Robin Williams, his type of humor does not usually work for me. In fact, I always thought Mork and Mindy was where he did his best comedy. This movie is about a boy who disappeared while playing a board game. His sister who was playing at the time saw him disappear into said game and is basically a bit crazy later in her life thanks to this incident. Two children find and play this game one day and to their surprise the boy who disappeared has reappeared thanks to a roll of the dice. They now have to continue to play the game as things begin to pelt them, animals run amok, and a determined continually hunts the foursome down. The effects are okay for the time, but they are the type of effects that are in to many movies these days. The type that looks like they are there, but at the same time they do not. The comedy is okay, Robin Williams does not get as worked up in this one as he usually does in his films and you also get to see a young Kristen Dunst. This one coming out after her appearance in Interview with a Vampire. David Alan Grier also stars as a cop who gets caught up in the game as near the end the game really begins to cause quite a lot of chaos. Still, it is an effects driven family film so the story is a bit shallow. So worth a chuckle and it does have a lot to look at, but at times it seems almost like you are watching a video game rather than watching four people play a board game. Not board; Watched this on TV where it was aired as a tribute to the late Robin Williams. It's an enjoyable family-entertainment fantasy adventure with Williams playing a grown man who as a boy was sucked into a mysterious, dark board game called Jumanji, freed years later by a couple of young children who happen upon the game when they move into Williams's character by this time run-down house. Along with Williams also fully-grown girl friend of the time Kirsten Dunst, the four of them brave everything the game throws at them to finish it and free Williams to return to his old life. And does the game throw everything at them! Crazy monkeys, a roaring lion, a jungle which comes to life, hordes of stampeding elephants zebras and rhinos and one very persistent big game hunter. A veritable special effects fest, while the plot amounts to no more than awaiting the outcome of the next roll of the dice on the board, it all makes for good clean exciting fun and who amongst us as never enjoyed playing a board game as a child. The back stories about Williams being bullied as a child, having a fractious relationship with his dad and his adult wooing of Dunst are lightly drawn but all of course resolved happily ever after by the end. Williams is fine after he makes his delayed first appearance, portraying yet again a child trapped in a man's body just as he did in a line going back through Peter Pan in \"Hook\", \"Popeye\" all the way to his breakout part in \"Mork and Mindy\". Dunst offers good support and the kids aren't too gauche and sentimental either. Nice to see \"Cheers\" Bebe Neuwirth get a decent part too. I wouldn't call it Robin Williams defining role but as an update on the old children's matinée features, this was an entertaining feature made the better by Williams engaging performance. R.I.P. to him. Underrated, I think; This film is a lot better than others have ranked it. It deserves more than a 6 average. I gave it a 7 and believe it's underrated. The basic story is that years ago, while a child, Robin Williams was transported into the game he was playing at the time and trapped there. Later, two other children find the game board and play it, releasing a now grown up Williams, along with all sorts of dangerous animals and vines and stuff. These things threaten mankind and it's up to Williams, along with Bonnie Hunt, to find a way to stop these things from killing off man. There's a good bit of suspense and with every move the heroic folks make, something counteracts it and things nearly always end up being worse than before. They finally determine that the only way to end the horror is to finish the game that Williams started all those years ago. Now, if they could only find the game board. This is a well written adaptation of a popular book, and I found it quite entertaining. a game not like the other ones; \"Jumanji\" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game \"jumanji\" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy. Watchable Effects-laden family entertainer, though a bit predictable; This is a watchable family entertainer with some genuine scares. The plot appears complicated but is actually fairly simple. Hordes of wild animals appear and people flee. This happens again and again like clockwork throughout the film making it predictable after a while. On the plus side, Robin Williams is in manic form, and the Special Effects are agreeable though dated. Kirsten Dunst is very appealing in one of her earlier films. This is generally a pleasant watch, but on the whole, I prefer the newer film Zathura, which is also based on a board game. Overall 6/10 18 years of being a \"favourite\"; I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and \"Jumanji\" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie &amp; it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life. Has more depth than the book, but lacks much of its lustre; When I was in fifth Grade, I read a book called Jumanji. It was a 1982 book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera. A year later (February or March 1996), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In 1869, two young chaps bury in a chest \"Jumanji\", a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy. 100 years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in 1969, but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight\"; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic 1995, where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost... Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm. The other three characters, but the movie is so focused on the four players that everyone else looks like a decoration set. The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining . But the screenplay touches on the drama scenes so lightly that they do not create much justice to the film. The anarchic present looks like a throwback of Back to the Future II's Alternate 1985. But all ends well at the conclusion, and people will find it likable, including those who read the book. By the way, this was the first time I heard about Kirsten Dunst... **1/2 out of **** HORRIBLE!; This was on TV again recently, and naturally the kids stopped to watch it. Why I will never know. We own a copy and they rarely if ever put it in the VCR. Whose idea was this movie? Joe Johnston, the guy responsible for some of the worst movies of the 1990s and whose only really decent film was HONEY, which was way back when? I have said previously this is really a horror movie in disguise and obviously not a particularly good one. What in hell is with the special effects? Is there a worse-looking set of animals in film history? I wonder all these years later if maybe the distorted, cartoonish look of the monkeys and lion were intentional, since they sprang from a children's board game. But then why do the elephants, rhinos, pelican and even the oversized mosquito, look relatively normal? Robin Williams is about as bad as he ever got, except for the nightmarishly bad JACK (although I never saw his ripoff of Benigni, which I can just imagine to what depths he plummets, and I forgive him WHAT DREAMS MAY COME since he obviously did not write or direct that fiasco). View JUMANJI at your own mental peril! One of my favourite films ever; This film is great, it is definitely a family film (little kids might get scared when there are *SPOILER* guns shooting or when the giant spiders have surrounded the actors,or when a crocodile attacks the man but apart from that it isn't too scary), but it is one of those films everyone has got to see. I first watched this film when it first came onto TV (they now repeat it every year), and I have been captivated by the imaginative story every single time I've seen it. The basic storyline is that two kids find an old board game, but when they start playing, the madness begins- stampeding animals and more! This is a story about friendship, love, sticking together and much, much more. If you haven't seen this film already WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!! Action and adventure for the kids, and Robin Williams for the adults; Find a comfortable chair, lay out the board, grab the dice, and get ready to play.  But remember:  once you start this game, you can't stop.  If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must. \"Jumanji\" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  The basic premise stays the same:  a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure.  When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things.  Only finishing the game will make it all go away. In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added.  Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself.  He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing.  The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams!  Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter. Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles.  He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt.  The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the \"This is MY baby\" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike. Not for 13+ age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for 1980 not for 1995. Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. I love this movie so much; If you do not love this movie you are crazy. Its filled with action and excitement. I love Sarah Whittle played by the famous Bonnie Hunt. I also like Carl Bentley, a clueless police officer played by the comedian David Alan Grier. This movie is so creative. My sister and I watch the movie every weekend, we do not get tired of it. This movie did not get the awesome rating it deserved. People sometimes do not understand a quality move when they see one. I would strongly, strongly, strongly recommend the movie. Trust me you will love it to death. If you do not... then you are odd. Please watch the movie, try it you'll love it...duh!!! A great movie; JUMANJI I loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today! The movie is about a boy who finds a board game called Jumanji. When he takes it home and starts to play it with a friend, he soon realises that this is no ordinary game. He gets sucked into the game and is not released again until 26 years later 2 more kids find the game and release him. Now he is grown up and has to find a way to end this game before everything it releases destroys the town. Due to the sad passing of the genius that was Robin Williams, the TV channels have decided to show all of his movies. Jumanji was the first one I saw. The story to this film is like not her that I had seen before. It was an original idea (unless there is another film I don't know about) that was just so imaginative. It works really well and has a great adventure element about it. The effects are average. This was made in the mid 90s so that probably has something to do with it. The animals were obviously not real. You could see the lion was so mechanical it made me laugh. And the other animals were so obviously computer generated. But it was comical and that just added to the fun of the film. The acting was great. The main character was played by Robin Williams. He was as energetic and full of character in this role, just like he brought to every role he took. Other cast members were Jonathan Hyde, a young Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bonnie Hunt. Bonnie Hunt was brilliant. Her reaction and facial expressions made me laugh a few times in this. Another stand out performance was by David Alan Grier. David was so funny as the cop. His comedy timing was excellent and deserves a mention. This film really does keep you entertained throughout and is just a lot of fun to watch... Even now nearly 20 years later. I will give this 7 out of 10. Normally I end my reviews with a quote from the movie, but this time I just want to say how gutted I am about the news of Robins death. I am a fan of his work. I watched Mork and Mindy when I was a kid and grew up watching Jumanji, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam, Jack etc... There were so many great films that he made. I always saw Robin as so full of energy and full of life. He had one of the greatest smiles in Hollywood and when i saw an interview with him, he seemed so chirpy and happy. It just shows that in front of the camera, you never know what is going on in people's heads. I was sad to hear he had been suffering from depression. Depression is such a deadly illness. I know this sounds stupid, but I am gutted that I was not there to talk to him, help him. I hate to think that he felt so alone, especially as he had millions of fans all over the world that knew him on screen. He made the world laugh out loud so many times. Even through bad times in my life, watching his movies has put a smile on my face. Robin deserved much more happiness than he got. He gave so much to me and the rest of the world and it doesn't seem right that he should end his life this way. I will miss seeing new movies from him, but will always continue to go back to enjoy his old ones. Robin will live on in my house and he will always continue to make me smile. R.I.P. Robin Williams. Jumanji  a timeless adventure story; There are few children's movies that I particularly enjoyed  I can recount The Borrowers, Labyrinth and The Neverending Story. Jumanji, however takes a new place among children's films  in fact, it may seem that initially, Jumanji is about simplistic story about kids playing a board game. Based on a gorgeous picture book story of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg, this movie takes a beautiful magical adventure and makes it into a thrill ride that defies all natural laws. Time travel, physical transformations, perceptual distortions and multiple universes are just a few of the things that Jumanji toys with. The most evident phenomena is that the characters run in two different and parallel universes, one where Jumanji exists, and the other where it is just a dream. The life of Judy and Peter as orphans exists in a different world from the one where Jumanji doesn't exist  in other words, Jumanji is a catalyst of fate, an evil entity that does not bring about awe as it did in Allsberg's book, but fear. The world that Allen Parrish is doomed to be incarcerated in the jungles of Jumanji is another one, but that period of time is nonexistent in the world he will eventually live in. This is the beauty of the movie; that these characters can only allow their trauma and epiphanies to cross worlds. With each roll of the dice, the characters grow and change. The ending with 'Jumanji' is mark of the end of that universe  everything that the jungle world had yielded, from the colonist-hunter Van Pelt to the roaring stampede and the monkeys had to return, to be sealed into the game and the universe. The game controls life; but it is merciful when played to the end without cheating. The mental agony and pain must have been tremendous for the Parrishes. Presumably, Alan spent his twenty six years in the jungle, but returned to his old self only to again relive his life as if it never happened. The temporal distortion must have presumably had an effect on his parents, although only Sarah seems to notice. (She was playing the game  and only those playing are directly affected, but in the game universe of Judy and Peter we see a problem in the movie's understanding of temporal change) The power of fate in deciding the endgame was critical in the film. It seems that the game was in itself a game of a game; it was all planned out and ready to go. In fact, it also seems that no matter how crazy or perilous the situation is, the characters cannot be killed. Even Van Pelt says at the Sir Sav A Lot that \"I am hunting only Alan. I won't kill you, since you didn't roll\" He too is bound to the rules of the game, no matter how much of a colonialist he is. The game instills a high level of fear without death, in order for the game to continue, all the characters must be present. So in one way, no one need be scared of anything in the game. Instead, the game builds resilience in the characters. It was natural that in the end the end was initiated by the future; or more appropriately the past. At the end, both Sarah and Alan make up for the trouble they have caused and have a life bond from the experience. The jumping between 1994 and 1964 is a critical aspect where we see that the horrors of the game have allowed Judy and Peter's parents to not die in the ski accident. They are oddly willing to put an end to their vacation when they hardly know the Parrishes \"In the jungle, you must wait, until you roll a five or eight\"  Jumanji \"Roll a two, roll a four, but never ask for more\"  Gautam RATING: 10/10 (amazing) Great fun; Robin Williams is in his element as an adult/child and with wonderful support from Kirsten Dunst, Ian Richardson playing the Englishman hunter and sending himself up nicely, the excellent children and others make this escapist adventure at it's best. A Dazzling Film!; I liked Jumanji. It is way better than I thought it would be. The story starts out with the burying of a game in 1869. It is then uncovered by a boy named Alan, 100 years later. As he is playing it, he gets sucked into the game until someone rolls a 5 or an 8. That happened 26 years later. Now along with two kids and a woman who was playing the game with Alan in 1969, Alan has to finish the game despite all the creatures appearing out of the game. The special effects are amazing. They were effective and used well. The acting is decent. Robin Williams did a good job as he usually does. I did think that Hunter Van Pelt could've been more realistic. The music is pretty good. I always liked James Horner's music. There are only minor flaws here or there. I rate this movie 9/10. Better than the sequel!; I really enjoyed this movie. I saw the sequel first, and then the \"original\" and I must say I am impressed and surprised by the way the movie worked. And I enjoyed it a lot. It's a board game that, when you roll dice, the numbers state where your piece should go, and then a message appears. The message could be something like, \"run away before the lion gets you\" and sure enough, a lion will suddenly appear in your house, ready to get you! I rate this 8/10 because of the fact that there was mild swearing, and I thought it was pushing it with the kiss at the end. But overall I enjoyed the movie! Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Welcome to the jungle, we've got fun and games; Oh yes, another childhood favourite starring the late-great Robin Williams, a true master of his craft. Jumanji simply put is a bundle of fun, why analyse a film like this? Truth is you shouldn't, just sit back and let the wacky action take you away..., it has wild animals, a dangerous board game and a throwback from the 19th century, intent on murdering Alan (poor Robin Williams!) So as a child Alan discovers a board game called Jumanji, but this is no ordinary game, he enlists his good friend Sarah to play it with him, unfortunately for the poor lad, he rolls the wrong number and gets sucked into the game, for many years. Years later, two kids Judy and Peter rediscover the game that had been hidden and decide to play, quickly releasing Alan from his jungle prison, from here on in the action is frantic and joyous, with a race around town, an adult Sarah joining the game and many-many mishaps as the quartet anxiously try to complete the game and get to the end. Who on earth thought a film about a board game could be so good? Masterful, cute and camp comedy by the legend of the genre helps to lift the film up to lofty heights, a very young Kirsten Dunst and an always reliable Bonnie Hunt put in professional performances as well..., a proper Sunday afternoon film that's a surefire way to boost moral. For 1995 when Jumanji was released, the special effects and computer generated imagery were spectacular, to make the variety of animals appear so lifelike was amazing..., the carnage that spreads across town was well shot and the cinematographer and art department team had a real good eye for detail. There's a new Jumanji film soon to be released, kind of a sequel to this film starring The Rock, but the new film will have to go some way to living up to the original, I doubt it will be anywhere near the quality and enjoyment that this film possesses, The Rock instead of Robin Williams, and that's going to work how? Sit down, relax and enjoy, with Jumanji it's as simple as that. Brilliant family entertainment!; While I try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, I do think the rating for this film is too low. The film is absolutely fantastic in all departments. I will admit, there are some bits that are quite scary due to some scenes that are amazingly dark. The film does start off slowly, but when the film fast forwards to twenty six years later, the film turns into fast-paced family entertainment. Other than one or two scary scenes and the slow beginning, I could find very little wrong with Jumanji. The story is great, very intriguing and filled with humour, scares and poignancy. The cinematography and scenery are constantly breathtaking, and the special effects are extraordinary. The film is aided by a hilarious and poignant script, spirited direction, atmspheric music and the fact that it goes at a very fast pace. Even the acting was great, with Robin Williams in one of his best performances as Alan Parrish. While he is subtle in places, the director allows him to be funny, which is what he does best. Bonnie Hunt is good too and she and Williams have great chemistry, and Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst are cute and lively. Plus the ending is nice and satisfying. All in all, I love this movie, even with its very minor problems, it is non-stop fast paced family entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Exciting Family Adventure; In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called \"Jumanji\", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished. Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human. The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like \"Dead Poet's Society\" or \"Good Morning, Vietnam\"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality. This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor. Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the \"Narnia\" stories). Fortunately, any moralising in \"Jumanji\" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of \"alternative timelines\". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10 Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is 1969, and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats. 26 years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good! wild CGI destruction gets repetitive; In 1869, two boys bury a mysterious dangerous wooden chest. In 1969 Brantford, New Hampshire, young Alan Parrish gets picked on by bullies. He finds the box in a local construction site. He opens the chest to find a board game Jumanji. His father is sending him to boarding school. He is about to run away when his best friend Sarah Whittle comes by. They play the game and Alan is pulled into the board game. Twenty six years later, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) buys the rundown mansion planning to open a bed-and-breakfast. She brings her niece Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter (Bradley Pierce) who lost their parents in a car accident. The kids find the board game in the attic and start playing it. Alan (Robin Williams) is released. They track down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) to finish the game and bring all the released apparitions to an end. Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) was a friend who worked at Alan's shoe factory and is now a cop. The game brings out big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) who looks like Alan's father Sam. The basic idea of a board game that comes alive is one with great possibilities. I wish that it is more than just a series of crazy CGI destruction. I wish that the players needed to use their brain power to solve clues. The constant escaping from one thing to the next gets a little bit repetitive. They start piling on top of one another. Williams is not quite as lovable as expected. Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier are kind of fun. There is an uncontrolled quality to this children's movie. i miss my childhood; 6.6,,,,,,,,,,,,, i don't believe this. 10 people 10,,, anyone who have watched this as a kid will give this a 10... common for heavens sake,,, this is the best fantasy movie that some one could wish for as a kid.......... for heavens sake this movie was not made keeping logic in mind please,, its just fun,,, thats all it is,,,this movie is one of the best memories A KID OF 90S HAVE AS A KID,,,people who hate this movie can go to hell,,,, any parents out there please let your kids watch this,,, they will love you a lot..these are the kind of movies which make me miss my childhood ,,, Jumanji Lays Down The Smack!; This is a great Hollywood thrill ride of a movie.  I loved the idea for this flick, a mystical board game coming to life.  What's great about this film is that for once Robin Williams isn't doing his usual \"Robin Williams\" stand-up schtick.  He's playing an original character and it's about time too, daddy-o. This movie is a great blend of thrills, special effects and laughs.  I like how it uses a lot of the old jungle movie icons like the Great White British Hunter, giant crocs, lions, mischievous monkeys and rhinos.  And even the actual Jumanji game board itself looked cool!  I wanted to own one.  I write screenplays myself on occasion and this film made me wanna write my own special effects extravaganza! But go checkety check out Jumanji and have a great time at the movies. Dig?  Dangerous Boarding Game; In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called \"Jumanji\" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan's father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. \"Jumanji\" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90's. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Jumanji\" Watts meets New England; Disaster visits a New England town: When all hell breaks loose, when beasts from nowhere trample the streets and earthquakes rip the blocks and giant mosquitoes and God-knows-what-next befall the descendants of pilgrims and fishermen, of Minutemen and revolutionaries and of immigrants yearning to breath free, those same hard-scrabble, salt-of-the-earth, no-nonsense patriots all join hands, pull together, and-- . . . loot their neighbors' downtown storefronts! Unbelievable.  Tinseltown belts out a fairly well-done and imaginative fantasy (which truly `Jumanji' is), and then--wouldn't you know it?--foul it with one of the many flies stuck in the ointment that is Hollywood, a scene so diagnostic of the intellectual sickness that has infested the industry since Hellman sang her praises to Stalin.  Then again, maybe it is believable. `Jumanji's' only other flaws: a part too small for the underrated Bebe Neuwirth (a joy to watch always and here no less so), kids full of bravery that's a little too scripted and moments of suspense that really aren't. If we can ignore all that, even the brief bit of class-warfare propaganda, then \"Jumanji' becomes eminently watchable, even memorable. But promise us you won't loot any stores next time you see monkeys charging down the street. If I could go back...; I love this movie. I don't know why. Maybe because I wonder what it would be like to start my life over again when I was 10 or 12, knowing what I know now at...well, much older. My favorite part is at the end, when Alan and Sarah come face to face in 1995 with the 2 kids who played the game with them the PREVIOUS 1995. Visually very interesting and not a rip off of any other film, that's for sure! When your life hangs on a simple roll of dice...; NOTE: this comment is provided by Christopher Dorian and Peter Rhydon. When young Alan Parish and his friend Sarah Wittle sat in Alan's living room and began playing to that strange game named \"Jumanji\", neither them, nor the audience, could have expected what was coming after. Because \"Jumanji\" is not your parents' \"Payday\". The game instructions are simple: roll the dice and the player who reaches the end first is the winner. It's just in-between that things go a little bit different... What was just a little game meeting transforms into a special effects extravaganza, filled with all sorts of creatures and eye-catching action scenes and stunts that seem to be borrowed from the best moments of the Indiana Jones adventures. The computerized special FX are the main aspects of the movie and they mostly succeed to their task. While they may look archaic today, remember that these visual tricks were created in 1995, and that computer-driven movies were a new sensation. Looking at the lion's faces isn't completely interesting, but it's worth the effort. Action scenes are well conceived, well acted, and well pictured. Particularly memorable is the crocodile fight in the flooded house, with the characters trying to defend themselves like the Orca crew in \"Jaws\". Those two points are tightly linked with one man: director Joe Johnston, who previously made \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\" and \"The Pagemaster\". He clearly shows that his former employers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had a huge effect on him and that he gets inspiration from those two phenomenons. And when we see the final result, we could feel that Johnston could become a phenomenon too. But it isn't the case. And why? Because \"Jumanji\" relies on a quicksand storyline and poor lines, because characters are occasionally believable and because action scenes are not epic in the Star Wars or Indiana Jones style. The concept is excellent, but the developed elements are not on the same level. Characters are often performing in cliché and predictable scenes, instead of innovative situations. If we talk about the actors, one should prevail from the others: Robin Williams. Even if his grinning smile looks stuck on his face like The Joker, he is a convincing jungle raider and his performance is fantastic, whatever it is for dramatic, terrifying or comic moments. What is also good about the film is that it can be enjoyed by people from all ages. Children will be delighted and excited by the animals depicted here and adults will enjoy the magnitude of the special effects employed during the film. The dialog is generally well suited for a general audience and there is no real troubling or disturbing moment. It's good to see that the '90s still deals with that kind of stuff. Technological developments imply more and more sophisticated video games of all kinds, but it's heart-warming to see that classic board games can provide excitement like this. After seeing that movie, playing \"Monopoly\" would seem to be like a tea party or some other kind of silly joke. Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... Epitome of Moronic Hollywood Film-Making; A previous reviewer wrote: \"A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie.\" I agree in part and disagree in part with that comment. The problem is impossible to pinpoint, because there are PLENTY of \"big problems\" with this movie! \"Random hazard generator\" is the PERFECT description of the ancient board game! Random hazard after random hazard until the game ends is what is supposed to pass for \"plot\" in this movie. Did anybody count how many times the game board fell out of and back into the players' hands? That, too is supposed to pass for tension. Ultimately, the film fails because there isn't any development of the back story. What was the origin of the game? Now, that would have been an interesting question to explore! And how does the game work? All we ever see is the game's projection of \"random hazards\" OUTWARD into the reality of the players, but somehow Alan (Robin Williams) apparently was sucked INTO the game. How did that happen, and why doesn't it happen to any of the current players of the game? Actually, the guy in the pith helmet is, more or less, the human villain in this movie, but he is never more than an inexplicable, evil cartoon. Was he, too sucked into the game like Alan, or is he the sole human \"random hazard\" generated by the game? Why is he so determined, not to hunt animals, but to MURDER Alan? The film just glosses over the fact that this sub-plot is actually one of premeditated murder! The hunter guns for Alan simply because the plot demands it. But the movie makes no attempt whatever to explain the character. Never once did I sense any genuine emotional chemistry among the characters. Just a bunch of actors acting - not INTERACTING. The love story sub-plot felt obligatory, never genuine. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt never generated enough chemistry to make me care whether Alan and Sarah got together in the predictable end. All in all, this film has the germ of an interesting idea that is really wasted by focusing on mindless, non-stop \"random hazards,\" poor CGI effects, \"lots of screaming and running around\" and insufficient character development. Except for the precise nature of each \"random hazard,\" the whole film was disappointingly predictable, including the cliché of the almost-kiss in the midst of peril routine. How many zillion times has that been used? The dialog is a similarly endless stream of clichés. The issue was never HOW the game would end - but WHEN. The more interesting issues were never even glanced at. This kind of movie can only appeal to people raised on video games. It was generated by that kind of adventure-for-the-sake-of-adventure mentality, and it has that same kind of feel. This Ain't No Game!; CONTAINS SPOILERS In 1869, two boys bury something unknown but whatever it is, it's very dangerous. It stays for 100 years. In 1969, young Alan Parrish rides his bike one lovely day, unfortunately he's soon chased by Billy Jessup and his gang. Alan goes to his father, Samuel's shoe factory. Alan tells his father what's up, but his father merely tells him that he must stand and face something you're afraid of, so Alan did and got the crap kicked out of him. Suddenly, he heard drums beating. It was in a construction site. He dug up a wooden board game called Jumanji. At home, Alan's parents have announced that they shall send him to Cliffside School for Boys. Alan refuses to go. Samuel get's mad and storms out of the house with his wife. Alan's friend, Sarah Widdle, comes over that night and the two decide to play the game Alan found. It resulted in Alan being sucked into the game until someone would roll a 5 or 8. 26 years later-1995. A woman named Nora, her niece Judy and nephew Peter buy the old Parrish house. One aternoon, while Aunt Nora left for the office and the kids were about to leave for school when they hear drums beating. The game was calling. They dig it out of the attic and decide to play it. Out of the game comes monkeys, mosquitos and a lion! Also, Alan comes out. He's very grateful, then goes to the old shoe factory to find his parents. He learns of their passing; by finishing the game, they can put an end to the wild animal attacks, so the three go off to find Sarah Widdle, because according to the game, it was her turn. At first she was reluctant to play, but she did. They encounter a huge pod plant and a hunter, Van Pelt who wants to kill Alan for some reason. Well, after braving a stampede, a huge rain fall, giant spiders and an earthquake, the game was over and all went back to 1969 where Alan patched things up with his father, he and Sarah get rid of the game and live happily ever after in the bright and cheerful 1995, rather than the dark one Jumanji had created. Pretty good movie! Nice special effects. Robin Williams was good, as always. Bonnie Hunt was good. The kids were too. Kirsten Dunst grew up to play Spiderman's love interest. Also, the same actor that plaus Samuel Parrish (Jonathan Hyde of Richie Rich) also plays Van Pelt. I hear there's going to be a sequel: Jumanji 2. But it doesn't have Robin Williams. For the life of me, I can't figure out what it will be like. But for now, you gotta see the first one! -- Jumanji! From Book to Film; As a child in 1995, this was one of the greatest adventure films for a kid in my generation. The book from where it came, was good, but the filmmakers made the adaptation pretty darn amazing. The fact that Robin Williams starred made the film better, as Robin was a huge draw to family films of that era. Who ever knew that Jumanji would have a cult following or that it would spawn an actual board game (nothing comes to life), and eventually a sequel in 2017. Too bad Robin isn't here to enjoy or be a part of the sequel. Bonnie Hunt also starred alongside Robin in this film as Sarah, but she's not quite as memorable. Sorry! David Alan Grier also co-starred as Carl the police officer, his acting was somewhat more memorable. One of the most memorable acting performances of the film was Jonathan Hyde as Sam Parrish (Alan's dad) and his dual role as Van Pelt (the hunter from Jumanji). In the end, it was a great film, probably felt more now by some since the passing of Robin Williams. But those of us who've loved the film since the beginning know he made the film what it was. Ignore the critics on this one--it's a great romp that gets better with time!; **Warning--Spoilers** We've owned Jumanji on video since it was released in 1996 and pull it out a couple of times each year for kicks.  It's as fun today as the first time we saw it with plenty of twists and plot turns to keep you hooked through the closing credits.  I've read the reviews by several of the critics on IMDB, and it is obvious they just don't get it. Criticism #1:  \"Jumanji is too scary for kids\":  Our children (ages 2 to 11) have all seen this at an early age and none was ever the slightest bit frightened.  Jumanji doesn't scare kids because 1) the dangers are never prolonged; 2) there is a ton of humor interwoven in the dialogue; and 3) everyone knows it's just a game.  After all, the pranks in Jumanji are no more harmful than what you see in Looney Tunes or Roadrunner &amp; Coyote and kids instinctively get that. Criticism #2: \"Jumanji has no story\": wrong again.  Every time we watch it, something new comes out, particularly in the relationships between the main characters.  There are particularly poignant moments between the father and son characters allowing them to reconcile and overcome the aloofness that can keep men from coming to grips with their feelings toward each other. And, the Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt relationship has a great payoff with romance and their triumph over forces of nature (real and implied). There are also numerous humorous details and themes that run through the film from stampeding rhinos to run-a-muck monkeys that keeping you laughing throughout the entire film. Criticism #3: \"The special effects overwhelm the story\":  The film is based on an animated children's book and the special effects intentionally mirror the artwork from the book.  My kids oohed and ahhed at each and every FX enhanced adventure from the stampeding animals to the wood floor turning to quicksand and in each case the result was to stimulate a great deal of discussion about the ideas in the story.  The monkeys are particularly funny evoking squeals of laughter as they embark on their high jinx. So, don't let bad reviews deter you from seeing this flick.  You and your family will have a great time during the movie and your kids will want to talk about every aspect of Jumanji after it's over, even if it's just an excuse not to go to bed on time! The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for 25(?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\"  So you'll help us?; Robin Williams is incredible as Alan in this outstanding adventure movie. The supporting cast is phenomenal. The costumes are conservative. One of the good films in the genre, Jumanji will dare the viewer to play the game. 7 out of 10. When two kids from the 60's stumble upon a game, one of them is sucked into its jungle.  Now it's up to two present day kids to finish it.; ********/10 This movie deserves more than it received because it is not only a very different plot but has excellent character development, which is key to a great movie. The special effects are so-so (due to the time period in which it was made), but it is overall exciting while humorous. There isn't a movie quite like this one, and is one of my favorites. Robbin Williams is tremendous and while watching it you forget his true identity. Kerstien Dunst is young, but is impressive for her age, commonly not found in some movies. I guess if I'd have to sum this movie up in one word it'd be \"unique\". Not many films have monsoons indoors or mansions turned into jungles. Entertaining...but one major problem; Jumanji is an entertaining movie. I'm surprised its IMDB \"User Rating\" is only 5.9. I would give it a 7. However, I don't understand why the kids (and Robin Williams) keep playing the game. With every roll of the dice, they put their lives in more jeopardy...along with the lives of everyone in the city. They could have stopped anytime after the bats or the mosquitoes or the monkeys or the lion. But they kept going (under the guise of \"finishing the game is the only way to make everything return to normal\"). I kept yelling at the screen, \"Stop playing Jumanji and you'll be okay.\" Of course, if they had stopped playing the game, then there's no movie. not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late 1960s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ A little adventurous... and childish.; Jumanji is a great idea.  The movie has great potential and could have turned out excellent and a true action classic. However, some aspects of the movie prevent that.  For example, the monkeys in the kitchen and abroad hardly look like monkeys.  They look like warped, evil, demonic beings with fur and tails that were only made to cause mischief.  Well, sure, you might say that's what the game meant to do, but come on... I think they should have used real monkeys here. Certain parts of the dialogue are a little corny and make one feel as though we're watching \"Spy Kids\", which can sometimes really ruin the feel that they're in a life-or-death situation. The acting was great (some parts it was not), and as usual, Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst put on an above-average performance. The action and crashes and other sequences are a contradiction, in a way.  Here we have fake-looking monkeys, but superbly crafted action. The music, composed by James Horner, is quite dull and does not help get you into the spirit of the movie.  A lower-than-average job on his part. Overall, this movie is really good.  I would suggest watching it if you can get past some annoying areas of the movie. Almost 20 years on and it's still entertaining kids of all ages; Jumanji was on TV today, and my 8 year old son had liked him in \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and I remembered it being fun, so with sweets and crisps we sat down to watch it. Orphans Judy (A young Kristen Dunst, who had started in \"An Interview With A Vampire\" the previous year, but still a few years away from Spiderman fame) and Peter move in to a mansion with their Aunt (Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers) where the find a board game called Jumanji. When they start playing, they free Alan Parish (Robin Williams) who was trapped in the game when he was a child. Robin Williams is always fun to watch and he was very popular at the time, due to movies like \"Aladdin\" and \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and Kristen Dunst was a real talent as a young actress, none of the annoying traits of usual child actors. Of the supporting cast David Alan Grier is fun as a hapless Police Officer, as is Jonathan Hyde in duel roles as a hunter and young Alan's Dad. Defo worth checking out if you have kids, and more than enjoyable even if you don't. Some of the special effects have dated badly, but are still OK, most of the humour is spot on too. My son got a big kick out if it and really enjoyed it. And I thought for a 19 year old special effects laden kids movie it had held up pretty well. An enjoyable board game, so an enjoyable movie!; This is one of the movies that I really enjoy, even if I do not like comedy and fantasy that much, by the way I don't like Robin Williams either, he thinks he's a funny person, but he isn't, some of his movies like `Jack', `Good Will Hunting', and some others are quite bad. Most of his movies leave too much to be desired. He's just annoying, because it seems to me that he thinks that everybody who sees him will laugh at the ridiculous things he does, he enjoys making fun of the human body, women, men, etc. I dislike it enormously; however I must say that I really enjoyed this movie even though he was starring and the visual effects were obviously computerized. I was impressed by the originality of Jumanji. It's such an innovative, interesting and enjoyable movie. I liked it because the plot is extremely original, creative and gripping. Who on earth would be able to think of a game like Jumanji? An imaginative game in which journeys, action, fantasy, and perhaps a little bit of terror surpass all things. I like this movie because it teaches us to enjoy everyday to its fullest, we see that Alan Parker was a frustrated kid at the beginning of the movie, but after staying in the jungle until the dice read 5 or 8, he realized how worthy his life was. Also it teaches us to respect others, for instance we see the little boy who began to turn into a wolf after cheating on the game was crying and Alan who was a grown-up person then yelled at him, and made him feel bad, but after that he was sorry since he remembered the way his father yelled at him, so this is a valuable lesson, since it shows that parents must be patient and loving to their family, but sometimes love can be hazardous to them. `Jumanji' is a nice movie for all ages; it's a very risky, but enjoyable game, in which your life is at stake. The board game (Jumanji) was good looking, it was really mysterious and interesting, whoever saw it would love to play it. Overall the movie was a very good one, I enjoyed every minute and especially Kristin Dunst's performance who also played in \"Spiderman\", I also enjoyed Mr. Williams's performance, I'm glad he at last did something worth it. Anyway it was an enjoyable movie, but I'd have loved this if it had been more dramatic, terrifying, sad, etc. 8/10 Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. Game You Could Only Dream About; Alan Parrish is the son of wealthy shoe maker Samuel Parrish. But the life of a rich man's son changes when young Alan comes upon a new board game, he is transported into it while playing it. Twenty or so years later two orphaned children, Judy (Kristen Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) come upon the game and play it. Next thing they now, Alan pops out of the game twenty years older along with a lion and some monkeys. It is a race to win the game with Alan (Robin Williams), Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt), Judy, and Peter while trying to outrun stampedes and Van Pelt, the man hunter. The movie has what a movie should have. The interaction of some of then animals is sometimes scary, sometimes funny, and sometimes just strange. Robin Williams is good like always and supported by Dunst, Hunt, and Jonathan Hyde (Van Pelt). It's what some mite call a child thriller. What to classify it as is though but it was good. Jumanji. Starring: Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kristen Dunst, Bradley Pierce, and Jonathan Hyde. 3 out of 5 Stars. Probably not perfect, but very fun; Jumanji is a highly imaginative and very fun movie. The visuals are good, and the story is creative and exciting. The storyline consists of a man being sucked into a board game. 26 years later, two kids find the board game and set him free. However, the game board has already released a few dangers, and those dangers must be stopped. The only way to do that is to finish the board game, and the animals (or whatever else was released from the game) will be put back into the game. There is action and minor thrills, and the movie emerges as being a fun experience. It's kind of creative, and it's an excellent adventure film. Sure, it is a bit cliché'd and the monkeys look pretty corny, but don't let them distract you from the overall enjoyment of the movie. 6.5/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment. A breathless unforgettable adventure!; I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind... This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure. Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story. Great! 10 out of 10 from me! My favorite movie as a child; I first saw this movie when I was 8 or something and I loved it immediately. The idea that you could actually play a game that could have the consequences Jumanji had was awe-inspiring for a kid like me. When I saw it again on TV 2 or 3 years later I taped it and watched it over and over again. At one moment I would lay in my bed and play the movie second by second and word by word in my head. That's how obsessed I was with this film. The action made me want to study biology and major in zoology actually. But I didn't study biology, I am a film student now. And from a film student point of view this movie is, of course, nothing special. The effects aren't perfect, it's no quality film and certainly not Oscar worthy or anything. But from a personal point of view, it still amazes me. When I watch it again it takes me back to my childhood and the amazing visions I had back then of it actually happening in my school and such. For that sense of nostalgia and the memories I have for this movie, I give this a straight 10 out of 10. After all, it was my favorite movie as a child. Brings back a lot of memories. Still a good ride.; My Take: A terrific special effects-laden adventure. JUMANJI is among those films I strongly remember from my childhood. Along with JURASSIC PARK and its sequel, JUMANJI is among those films I enjoy watching multiple times just to see creatures wreck havoc on a crowded street, monsters crawl in from the dark and other bits of special effects extravaganza. I strongly remember the elephants and rhinos stampeding around the crowded streets, a giant man-eating flower with vine-like tentacles, those messy (and weakly done CGI) monkeys with antics borrowed from GREMLINS, the crocodile and the shot of the house breaking apart. What I didn't remember was how faulty the dramatic interludes were. Which is exactly the point. JUMANJI is a wildly entertaining special effects extravaganza that works much better that way. Director Joe Johnston, who revived old-fashioned pulp adventures with THE ROCKETEER and later made JURASSIC PARK III so much better than it might have been, is such an accomplished action director. JUMANJI is a terrific and highly entertaining, if sometimes perilous, family adventure, though it does make several rest stops for back-stories and a bit of drama which sacrifices the pacing. The movie opens with two kids in 1969 with two kids curiously playing the titular game board which eventually unleashes African bats in the fireplace and sucking in little Alan Parrish (then played by Adam Hann-Byrd) inside the game. Forward 26 years later, someone else has bought the old Parrish mansion and the two new kids (Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce) dig up the old board game in the dusty old attic and give the dice a little role, and all hell breaks loose in town. With a little help from an older Alan Parrish (now played by Robin Williams) and his now older best friend Sarah (delightfully played by Bonnie Hunt), they try to finish what they started, unleashing more special effects behemoth after another. That's just about the \"plot\" of JUMANJI, yet I can go on forever with its visual treats. While the CGI doesn't live up to today standards (not to mention the totally unconvincing CGI monkeys!), but some of them in particular (including the terrific sequences where elephants and rhinos rampage around town and inside the mansion living room) still are eye candy. And, courtesy of director Johnston, there are still well-orchestrated moments of excitement. Stars Hunt and co-star David Alan Grier as a cop having a bad day provide the laughs. Despite some dull moments, which have a very major thing to do with its weak writing department, JUMANJI is still an amiable piece of entertainment. Still worth a look, but you might have the options of fast-forwarding to the really good parts. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5. 5 + 5 : « addictive and fun as a real game » (tv); I saw a little bit long ago and it seemed dull then. This time, i start another play right from the start and i found it still dull : the young boy appears a bit dumb, his wealthy family not better ",
       " And then, first comes teen Dunst and i'm really surprised how good she acted (as she never convinced me as Peter's girlfriend). Next, Robin gets in the movie getting out the game and the magic operates : i really like the way past, present and future merge, how the game expands to the big mansion into town. If the special effects looks very tired, the story is original, full of surprises and proves that a humble cast can do as fine as a multiple billion dollars one ! Robin proved one more time he was a never grown-up kid with a beautiful soul with kids and the key to childish fun ! So i had a great time with this small movie as it gives me all i ask to cinema : to find a way to leave (cautiously) my world behind !! Decent adventure; Well where do I begin. The Casting: I guess the casting was OK. Robin Williams does a decent job, same goes for Kirsten Dunst. I really love the Sara Whittle character, but I am unsure if its because of her written dialog, which I indeed love, or the acting of Bonnie Hunt. I don't know what role the policeman is supposed to play however. I mean he doesn't do anything really important and it seems like he is there just to tie up the loose ends. It is OK though, I would rather have this cop around than just having them loose the game some more, which I think would have been the other alternative. His supposed to be funny moments however is something the movie could've done without. The Story: I really enjoy the story! Its simple, not to serious and perfect for adventure. My problem with it is how the story about the characters end which is a bit counter dramatic. The moral of the story, whatever you perceive it to be, feels meaningless. Since everything just ends up a-okay for everyone. Some people have been complaining that you never get to know the origin of Jumanji or how it looks inside the game. I don't have that problem simply because it would take away all the mystery. The parts of the story I grow tired off is how they loose the game to often. I figure its to add suspense which works at times, but the movie overdoes it. Another thing that I don't really like is how Van Pelt, the hunter, has to buy a new modern rifle. I kind of liked the retro feeling to him, but that disappears when he has an enormous automatic black rifle with night-vision aim rather than his own old rifle. The effects: To be honest, what comes first in my book is acting and story. If you take the old batman movie the effects aren't at all impressive. But that don't stop them from being awesome. Same goes for this, sure the computer effects haven't aged well and the monkeys just look stupid. But it isn't that big a part of the movie. Maybe of the marketing but I've learned you have to take that part of the entertainment business with mountains of salt. I figure I got to much to say about the movie, there is a lot of stuff I haven't talked about, so I'll just stop here and sum my thoughts up. Its imaginative and adventurous with good acting and decent effects. The only part which stops me from giving it a 10 is the \"comic relief\" which is just stupid and unnecessary. A bit more adult sprinkled on this movie and it would be a lot better in my eyes. Still, a good movie! The end is near!; 'The end is near' was my best thought after an hour of Jumanji. The end of the movie that is. Despite a lot of good reviews of people I hardly know, this film is a first-class let-down. It is the somanieth movie in which Robin Williams comic qualities are abused. The story is about a game, Jumanji, that has come to life. After every move something terrible happens; a stampede or a giant spider attack. The game has to be finished to stop all terrible things happening. Of course Williams' comic talent and the special effects try to safe the movie but everything is overdone. By memory, I recall that the makers promised great special effects; they had used the same effects as Jurassic Park! Yes, they did, but they obviously only got the demo version of the package. Also, poor Kirsten Dunst, having the role of a nice young girl, is transformed is such a prig that all her good intentions fall into nothing. All in all, if you have to choose between watching this movie and cleaning up the house, please clean up your house starting with trashing the video of this movie. Good for children; beautiful film. As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is \"better\" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. A dark, mysterious, and entertaining childhood favorite of mine; Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good. review for jumanji.; This 1995 film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game 26 years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are 8+ as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than 8 and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark The jungle; This is an excellent movie for all ages. Congratulations to the cast, production, stunts and all the people. And now I want know what's happen in the jungle when Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) was there for 26 years. This should be a good adventure. Wish they had more Jumanji history; My only real complaint with Jumanji is where did this game come from? Who created it? I really wish they could have discovered more about the game's past, it's history. Then it would have made a little more sense. But I'm not saying I didn't like it. On the contrary, I do enjoy it very much, I think it's a cool buried treasure. The characters, the story, the effects all perfect. The cast does a great job in this movie and the concept of a strange magical board game works. I wish there was more monster animals. But the man eating plant and the giant spiders is enough to put it on my page. Robin Williams does great in this first monster movie, wish he do more. But that's just me. Anyway, in conclusion ladies and jelly spoons. This is an assume movie and you can do much worse then Jumanji. 8 STARS. An awesome movie...; This movie is great. The story is so interesting and unique. The cast do a great job of portraying their characters and the visual effects aren't bad for the mid-ninties. Some people say they don't like this movie, for whatever reason, but I think it's an enjoyable adventure that anyone would enjoy. This movie is about a board game. A very special board game. When two children play the game, everything that the their players do, happens to them. So when Alan's piece gets a card saying he has to wait in the jungle, he disappears, which nearly drives the young girl he was playing with mad. Twenty-six years later, two new kids play the game, and release Alan. Alan and the kids must get the other play to continue to game, otherwise they won't be free until it's completed. Best part of the movie: When Alan comes out of the game. Worst part of the movie: The spiders. Recommended for: Everyone. Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Amazing. Decent family entertainment; On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children. Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it. Fun little movie hidden in the back drawer; Movie plays. In comes zoo. Who's that laughing? Why it's you! Jumanji never made a big splash (though the PR engine tried its best) but it's a clever little fantasy about a magical board game that changes reality. The special effects are laughable and enjoyable at the same time, particularly the stampede, and altogether it's a fun jaunt. Surprisingly, considering that the rest of cast is mostly up-and-comers, Robin Williams doesn't dominate the film, but adds the right touch of insanity to the whole affair. But, like many Williams vehicles, there's a heavy \"let children be children\" component, as well as a domineering father figure who somehow just can't show his love for his child. Ignore all that, and just enjoy the game. 7 of 10 from me. The Disney movie that could have been; Hunt and Williams play the parts of shellshocked-delayed stress syndrome surviviors quite well. The story is entertaining and engrossing, with both elements of light and darkness. The effects-well, they DO look a bit unreal-and perhaps that is for the best-it adds a sense of unreality to the story -after all, these things come from a board-game universe! Even Van Pelt looks a bit CGI...and Bebe Nuewerth is a sweetie. An entertaining adventure movie; The thing that grabs people about this movie is the computer effects. They are supposed to be of a very high quality and very realistic. I must digress at this point because when I saw this movie recently I discovered that the effects were not as great as they are made out to be. In fact, the lion looked quite out of proportion and the monkeys looked quite fake. I think that they pushed themselves to a point where they could not do any better. Even though some of the effects were quite irritating, I did enjoy Jumanji. It is an adventure movie with everything, a stampede, deadly insects, lions, floods, earthquakes, and even a psychotic hunter with a very big gun. What makes this adventure movie different is that it is not set in the middle of Africa but rather in a quiet New England town, that is quiet until all of these things are unleashed upon it. The film begins in 1969 where little Alan Parrish is running away from bullies. He goes to his father's factory and notices a chest in one of the construction sites. Opening the chest he finds the game Jumanji. He takes it back home and plays it with his friend at which he promptly disappears. Fifteen years later, another two children find the game and decide to play it and release poor Alan Parrish. Having done that they realise that they must finished the game and revert everything back to normal. The interesting thing that I see in this movie is the difference in the time between 1969 and 1995. In 1969 everything is nice and everybody is friendly, with the exception of the bullies. Business is booming and the town is lovely and clean. This changes in 1995 for when Alan walks through the town we see a very different place. The once clean town park is now a squat for beggars, most of the shops have closed down and the Parish Shoe company has been abandoned. Alan Parrish spends 16 years in a jungle to emerge in a world that has completely changed. As is typical of Hollywood, everything reverts back to its original form at the end, which deludes us with the idea that we can return the world to the good old days. This is something that we cannot do. The pleasant memories of our past will always remain there, and as is seen in Jumaji, not everything about the past is all that pleasant. We can look forward to a time when everything is restored, but this restoration goes back to the time of the Garden of Eden. The perfect world of Eden will be restored, rather than our pleasant childhood memories. I still like this movie though. Robin Williams is not one of my most favourite actors, but he does not turn me off as actors such as Van Damme do. Rather, he is reasonable. It is not him that attracts me to the movie, but rather the story. The story is an adventure and it is what you get. Jumaji basically delivers what it promises. Very enjoyable fantasy adventure.; Jumanji starts in 1969 in New Hampshire in New England where a young boy named Alan Parish (Adam Hann-Byrdd) &amp; his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) starts playing a strange board game called Jumaji that Alan found buried in the ground earlier, Jumanji turns out to be magical &amp; Alan is sucked into the board game while Sarah runs off. Twenty six years later &amp; it's 1995 &amp; Alan's old house has been empty for years until now, until young brother &amp; sister Judy (Kirsten Dunst) &amp; Peter (Bradley Pierce) move in with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), the two youngsters find the Jumanji game &amp; start playing it themselves as all manner of creatures &amp; climate events begin to appear as does Alan (Robin Williams) who has spent the last twenty six years trapped inside Jumanji &amp; is now an adult. The only way to reverse the effects of Jumanji is to finish the game so with a now adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) the four players must battle whatever Jumanji throw's at them including Lions, Monsoon's, giant Spider's &amp; a stampede... Girected by former special effects man Joe Johnston this oddball fantasy adventure is actually pretty good but there are one or two things that ultimately drag it down to merely a very good film rather than a great film in my opinion. Based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsberg the film is apparently quite different &amp; the two main character's here Alan &amp; Sarah don't even appear in the book, Jumanji is a hard film to categorise as it mixes various ideas &amp; themes like a bad childhood, finding redemption, standing up to your fears, fantasy, sci-fi, horror &amp; comedy. At 100 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace, once it gets going the situation just keeps getting worse &amp; worse as all the chaos &amp; mayhem escalates beyond anyone's control with all sorts of animals running around &amp; the theme of facing your fears is an ever present one. I am not sure there is another film quite like Jumanji &amp; to find something so original &amp; different in a mainstream film is unusual but the CGI effects scenes, the lack of character depth, the refusal to do anything with the plot other than destroy a house &amp; an ultra happy ending which goes on forever that gives every character in the film the best most happy ending is pure Hollywood that was not needed &amp; a slightly darker ending in keeping with the slightly darker tone of the film overall would have been much better. To be honest apart from great set-pieces &amp; the basic concept there's really not that much to Jumanji at all, it's rather shallow &amp; it's attempts at depth are pure heavy handed Hollywood cliché but it's fun &amp; very entertaining while it lasts, just a shame about the last ten minutes really. Jumanji was made just as the CGI computer graphic revolution was taking off back in the mid 90's but the effects do hold up rather well actually, from huge plants to an impressive stampede of Rhino's &amp; Elephant's through a house to a huge Lion with the mischievous Monkey's probably the only real weak effect. As a fairly light hearted fantasy adventure with some darker overtones there's a few amusing moments including a bemused policeman who's car is slowly &amp; systematically trashed &amp; as a whole the film delights in needless destruction &amp; mayhem which is no bad thing. There are some laughs &amp; a few scares as well &amp; I could definitely see Jumanji appealing to both older &amp; younger audiences. With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 this had a very healthy amount spent on it with most going towards the effects I would have thought. Filmed in New Hampshire &amp; British Columbia in Canada. Despite being known as a manic performer Robin Williams is pretty restrained here &amp; his brand of psychical comedy isn't used much, Kirsten Dunst is one of the few child stars to go on &amp; have a successful adult career while the acting generally is pretty good. Jumanji is a unique fantasy adventure that I think would appeal to both children &amp; adults, my only real problem is the sweeter than sweet happier than happy ending which is pure sentimental Hollywood at it's worst. With an ending more in keeping with the rest of the film Jumanji might have got a seven from but as it is it gets a six, good but not great. Followed by Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005) which was shot under the title Jumanji 2. Jumanji; I think that kids would like this movie better then grownups. I loved this movie but my mom thinks the plot is to low. The movie is based on the book Jumanji and is a lot more deeper then the book. My bother thought that the movie was corny and the special effects were so bad they were funny but what does he know? OK maybe the effects were bad but whatever. I mean the movie was made along time ago so give them a break. I thought the movie was really good and the acting was great. Its the kind of movie that if you like it you watch it again and again and again. When I was sick I saw it 4 times and I still thought it was good. All and all I would give this movie a 9. I think that kids would like to see it. One word - fun! **mild spoilers**; B   \"Jumanji\" is, simply put, a fun, family-oriented action/adventure film.  From the killer plants to the CGI stampede and monkeys, to character actor Jonathan Hyde's (\"The Mummy\", \"Titanic\", \"Anaconda\") dual role as Alan Parrish's (Adam Hann-Bird/Robin Williams) father, and the ruthless man hunter Van Pelt, this is a gung-ho \"Indiana Jones\"-type film for kids. The plot is basically two sets of kids who discover a board game that makes the events that occur in them (killer mosquitoes, monkeys, etc.) come true.  Robin Williams plays Alan Parrish, a boy who got trapped in the game as a kid, with Bonnie Hunt as the girl who was with him and later, his love interest.  Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce play the two kids from 1995. I'll take my previous statement back - the film is more slapstick than \"Indiana Jones\".  A lot of the humor is physical or sight gags - eg. the monkeys riding a motorcycle with a pistol, which IS pretty damn funny, and the rows of supplies knocking over paint cans that bury Van Pelt. The film is suspenseful, well-produced, and has good special effects.  No, I'll take it back.  The monkeys and the lion look really fake (the stampede works since it would be hard to film a real one), but otherwise, they're okay. Aside from the fake-looking animals and the way-too-drawn-out ending, \"Jumanji\" is superb. Seven stars. Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a 10/10. Jumanji is fun!; What a great movie and a clever concept! A board game that sucks you into it, and must be finished by the originals who played the game. I remember seeing Jumanji in the movie theatre when it first came out, and this past weekend had the opportunity to rewatch it (thank you resale DVDs!) Starring Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, the action is fast paced and easy to follow. No swearing in this movie makes it appropriate for all ages, though little ones might be frightened by the rampaging animals. There is nothing Disneylike in their qualities. Still, the story of sticking together and teamwork prevail throughout the entire film. Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Greier are great in their supporting roles. Bonnie Hunt gets some of the best lines in the film with regards to cheating and a downtown sale. An early Kirstin Dunst is also great. If you have never seen Jumanji, I encourage you check it out. It's fun and you always wonder what the game is going to come up with next. LOVE THIS MOVIE!; Last night, May 2,2003  this movie was on again........no matter what other show we might be browsing at the time, we invariably start watching Jumanji,,,,,,we enjoy the hilarity and antics of all the characters,  it's done for shear  fun and entertainment, and we don't care if the special effects may be outdated,  we still consider it one of the best! So there! :-) Two  Happy Fishes  from oHIo Early CGI Makes the Monkeys Look Fake! Otherwise It's Amazing!; An enchanted board game breaks into the real world and the only way out of it is to finish the game! The monkeys look \"washed-out\" and so do some of the wild zoo animals; which is why most of the rest of the EFX are mechanical or use backdrops and mattes. Otherwise a very strong 10 would be my vote, as the casting works and the plot shows lots of imagination and flair. With a \"sly wink\" to \"Peter Pan\", Alan's father plays both his dad and Van Pelt the Hunter. My two favorite scenes are when the house gets folded in half and eaten by the monstrous plant, and when everything swirls backwards into the gameboard. I also love it when the house goes \"wild\" and turns into a swamp complete with nasty alligators. I do not like the scene where the little boy turns into a monkey with a tail. Young children may find it disturbing like the donkey transformation in \"Pinocchio\". \"Jumanji\" is suspenseful and scary but no one actually dies in the film. Therefore, it's much more enjoyable when viewed again. The only one who seemed to hate it was Roger Ebert, but it's only too scary for pre-schoolers. Most \"users\" love it! What \"scares\" me the most in this film: the bats, insects, spiders, alligators, and The Hunter. The sequel will not have the charisma of the late and great Robin Williams. I still miss him. He was a comic genius. If there was a market for it, I would like it to be re-imagined with better graphics like the old \"Star Trek TOS\" reissue. Entertaining family/adventure/fantasy; Released in 1995, \"Jumanji\" is fun movie about a mystical board game from the 1800s, which is found in 1969 leading to the mysterious disappearance of a rich boy. The game is discovered again in 1995 by two orphans (Jonathan Hyde and Kirsten Dunst) who play the game and bring back the lost boy now an adult (Robin Williams). The only way they can stop the havoc the game causes is to finish it. Bonnie Hunt, David Alan Grier and Bebe Neuwirth are also on hand. Patricia Clarkson has a small role. \"Jumanji\" is a great example of the way youth adventures should be done. It's entertaining from beginning to end for children, teens and adults. If you've lost sight of your inner-kid give \"Jumanji\" a try. What makes it worthwhile for adults, besides simply being fun, is that it contains compelling themes and everything ties-up for a moving climax. Plus Bebe Neuwrith looks great (she played Frasier's psychologist babe on Cheers). The movie runs 104 minutes and was shot in Maine, New Hampshire and the Vancouver, British Columbia, area. GRADE: B+ Imaginative (spoiler); This is probably one of the most imaginative movies I have seen in a while. I mean, it has an entire back story, as we can see in the beginning, when those two kids are trying to get rid of the game. Then it goes to 1969, when Alan finds the game, he and Sarah start playing, and he gets sucked into Jumanji. Then, throughout the rest of the movie, Alan comes out of the jungle and he, Sarah, Judy, and Peter continue playing the game and unleashing all these dangerous animals (and Van Pelt) and the monsoon and killer plants into the city. And at the end, those kids in Japan find the game. Very well thought out. Certainly worth a look. Fun!; I give this movie a ten on ten. I may be biased as I watched this movie when I was ten and whenever I watch it, it brings back fond memories of lazing around and watching movies during my summer vacations. But I am surprised that the overall rating for this movie is 6.5 (when I write this review), I expected it to be at least 7. This really is a fun movie to watch with some hilarious scenes. The monkey bike riding scene stands out it particular. The special effects looked good when I was young but now the fake animals are not very impressive. Jurassic Park was made before this movie and had much better special effects. Robin Williams does seem too old to play a 35 year old Alan Parish but he is a brilliant actor and you do not mind accepting him as Alan. Bonnie Hunt does a good job too as the paranoid Sarah Whittle. The kids do a great job too, especially Bradley Pierce; look out for the scene where he is searching for an axe. And David Grier is brilliant as the bumbling sheriff Carl Bentley. I suggest you watch this movie with your family on a weekend. Its worth it! My first crush on  Kirstin Dunst...; When this movie came out during the holiday season in 1995, I enjoyed it very much seeing it in SDDS and 35mm at the Sony in Wayne with my family and loved the effects. I even had the VHS for awhile. This is a good movie to test your surround sound system to the limits. The book was good, and the movie is better, but the TV show sucked. With the upcoming reboot replacing the board game with a video game coming out later this year, it's time to revisit this legendary Robin Williams family classic for the first time. An entertaining family film.; This film talks about a board game set in the inhospitable jungles of Indonesia that recreates magically the dangers in the board, for horror of the players involved. Directed by Joe Johnston, the film has a script by a team led by Jonathan Hensleigh. The main protagonist is Robin Williams, assisted by the young Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Yes, the theme of the movie would make a great horror film but, in this case, we have a comedy. And Robin Williams was definitely the \"Mr. comedy\". Any comic role fit him like a glove and this film was no exception. Although his character have some psychological depth, because of the trauma of being alone in the jungle for decades, it only serves to accentuate the humorous slant of what he says and does. The script is interesting, simple and very imaginative. The story works, entertains and holds the audience. The film scares a bit in certain scenes, but never in an excessive dose for children. The scenarios are good and the special, visual and sound effects are excellent. Some creatures in the film are clearly false and have a funny look. The soundtrack is regular, not bringing surprises, but doing their part without blemish. This film was made to entertain the audience, in particular the families, and does it very well.</td>\n",

       "      <td>OLDER, HORNIER AND STILL FRUSTRATED IN MINNESOTA;  `Grumpier Old Men' is a film that is a sequel to `Grumpy Old Men.' Reprising their original roles are Jack Lemmon as John Gustafson, Walter Matthau as Max Goldman, Ann Margaret as Ariel, Burgess Meredith as John's father, Kevin Pollock and Darryl Hannah as the children of Max and John. They are still next-door neighbors, only now the feud has subsided. Their children are living across the street in Ariel's house.  The marriage of their children is on the horizon. The setting for this film is summer and fall in Minnesota.  Fishing is still the main sport where `Catfish Hunter' is still the elusive prize.  The bait shop on the lake has been closed since Chuck passed away.  It is now under new management.  John and Max are anxiously waiting the reopening.  To their surprise, it is not being reopened as a bait shop, but a ristorante (restaurant).  Here enters Sophia Loren as the new proprietress Maria Sophia Calotti Ragetti.  Ann Guilbert who plays her mother joins her.  When Max and John find out the new plans for their favorite bait shop, they set out to undermine her plans for a grand opening.  A series of misunderstandings set off a domino effect that touches everyone's lives.  New loves are found and an old feud is rekindled. All of the same emotions that were in the previous film are in this film. There is laughter, sadness, anger and happiness.  Catfish Hunter makes his film debut, which, in essence, puts a `face' with a name.  His film appearance pays credence to the fact that he is a `real' fish and not just a myth.   The acting in this film is superb both by human and non-human.  Cute sequel that works; Fun story of two older men who never quite outgrew boyhood, and the ladies they love. What a treat to see two master actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, working with silly material and enjoying every minute of it. The lady loves, Ann Margret and the ever-sexy and dazzling Sophia Loren, do equally well with a lightweight, sometimes over-the-top script. The principals are aided by a uniformly fine supporting cast, including Burgess Meredith as the Lemmon character's outrageously lecherous dad, and Ann Morgan Guilbert as Sophia's feisty mama. The older players' interaction is a delight. My only quibble with this film is the fact that Meredith's character dies without getting married like everyone else. Why? I wondered whether Meredith had perhaps expired during filming, but, according to Wikipedia, the actor lived a whole two years following this movie's release! The original film, \"Grumpy Old Men,\" takes place during a picturesque Minnesota winter, with snow used to charming effect. The follow-up capitalizes on a Midwestern summer. Like apples and oranges, both productions satisfy. More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in 1995, 2 years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie 8 out of 10. A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances...; A sequel to the thoroughly enjoyable Grumpy Old Men, 'Grumpier Old Men' is A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances. The sequel has the spirit of its prequel &amp; the amazing cast, led by the impeccable talents of the Late/Great Jack Lemmon &amp; the Late/Great Walter Matthau, are in full form! 'Grumpier Old Men' Synopsis: John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. 'Grumpier Old Men' works well as a romantic-comedy, as it has moments of humour &amp; subtle romance. I loved the prequel &amp; I must say, the sequel doesn't fail to deliver. The film has sustained its energy &amp; wit, that one would expect from it. Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is entertaining, although initially the pace is slightly slow. Howard Deutch's Direction is top-class. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is good. Editing also is ably done. Performance-Wise: Lemmon &amp; Matthau shine all through. Its their sheer on-screen chemistry, that alone is worth watching the entire film. Sophia Loren is top-notch. Ann-Margret is impressive. Kevin Pollak &amp; Daryl Hannah leave a mark. Late/Great Burgess Meredith is memorable in his part. On the whole, 'Grumpier Old Men' is a smooth, relaxing watch. Oh, How The Mighty Have Fallen...; GRUMPY OLD MEN (3 outta 5 stars) GRUMPIER OLD MEN (2 outta 5 stars) I dunno why I even bothered to watch the second one. Oh, I guess because it was on cable TV shown as a double bill with the original \"Grumpy Old Men\". I liked the original when I first saw it. It was not the best work by the Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau team... but it had its moments... these two actors could probably read pages from the phone book to each other and still make it funny. Unfortunately, the sequel has even FEWER of those moments. Still, I maintain that no movie with either Lemmon OR Matthau in it can be *totally* worthless. This is probably as close as they ever got, though. (Bear in mind that I have not yet seen their last movie together, \"The Odd Couple II\".) Practically the same plot as the first movie... Lemmon and Matthau play lifelong acquaintances and next door neighbors who are constantly bickering about fish and/or women. Burgess Meredith plays Lemmon's FATHER... and if you find old people talking dirty hilarious then you'll probably love his scenes (especially in the closing credits outtakes). Ann Margaret and Sophia Loren play the women in the grumpy guys' lives... hard to imagine that women as attractive as they still are would want anything to do with these two old dorks but, hey... I guess pickings are slim after 65. very funny.; This film has some of the funniest lines and it's a great comedy. One would probably think, even I, thought that this would probably happen between two older men who fight about the obvious: women, fish and each other. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are a perfect pair. Even though it's a comedy, the romance in it is on the clean side. Nothing too distasteful and the comic relief is still included into the romance, which gives it a continuous comic flow. Even though there is a serious part of the film where John's father passes away, after that scene the film is back to the comic feel, which is nice because there's no dwelling on the sad/serious scene. Nonetheless, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh hard. Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Snoozing sequel with the leads in need of some No-Doz; Woeful, disappointing sequel to 1993's hit \"Grumpy Old Men\" is more retread than follow-up. The two crotchety neighbors--Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--bicker over their children (who will soon be making the sparring oldsters in-laws!) and, of course, who has the better fishing skills. They stop trading insults long enough for Matthau to begin irritating a new woman in town, a fiery Italian who has just opened her own restaurant. Sitcom humor with a sometimes-raunchy twist that is no longer fresh. Almost worth-seeing for Sophia Loren's funny, lively performance, but everyone else looks a little sleepy. Ann-Margret (who married Lemmon's character at the end of the original) must've dropped in for a day and a half to complete her work. As the youthful couple, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah are also under-used. ** from **** The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Back For More!; CONTAINS SPOILERS John Gustafson and Max Goldman are back in their first adventure since their last. It's six months later and they're still fishing. All the snow has melted and the neighborhood looks very different. The boys are out to catch a giant legendary fish they've heard tell about.          These men would soon discover big changes happening. Like, their friend Chuck, who died in the last adventure, had operated the bait shop. Ever since his demise, it's been empty, but some people have come with plans to turn it into a ristorante (restaurant). They are: Mama Regetti and daughter Maria. John and Max don't want that to happen so they pull numerous pranks on the Regettis but they still won't leave.         Jacob Goldman and Melanie Gustafson contemplate matrimony. But have their doubts when their fathers insist on planning the event. But when the kids decide the wedding is off, John and Max are back at it. Pulling all sorts of foolish pranks on one another. Max steals John's outboard motor, John wrecks Max's fish net and has his cat scratch up Max's car seats, but Max sends a big dog through John's house. Ariel decides to leave for a while. John was in a real pickle. He tried asking his father for advice, but he had passed away; Max goes on a date with Maria and they decide they like one another.        Pretty soon, it's a wedding day. En route to the church, Max and John decide to fish for the giant musket they're so fond of. They catch it, but John says they must leave it in the lake out of respect for his father, so they do and rush to church. It looks like the wedding of Jacob and Melanie, but it isn't. They eloped. It's the wedding of Max and Maria. John planted Max's dog in the limo as they drive off.        Was this as good as the first? Sure. I'm sorry to say that the three main stars, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith are no longer with us. Meredith died in 1998, Matthau in 2000 and Lemmon in 2001, which is real sad. So it's guarenteed there will never be an Even Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple III. They were really funny men. Why do the good ones always gotta die? But anyway, if you're a fan of these men and you enjoyed the first one, then I recommend Grumpier Old Men! - Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. 7/10 stars. 1/10; this movie sucked! I hate it! It's so boring! The acting is so bad! Why does Sophia Loren's italian character talk english to her italian mother when they're alone? The script is so bad! It's so corny! Max and John fighting with the fishing things is so silly! This movie was never funny! It was painful to watch, i'm telling you! Avoid it! Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT 7 out of 10 Delightful acting and script but silly scenes...; Always delighting in Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, warmed by their aging and childish pranks, I enjoyed this film which is filled with delightful acting and fun script.It suffers, however,  from more than a few silly scenes. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10 A sequel that's equal to the original comedy; The first go round was such a hit, that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau got together for this sequel to the 1993 smash hit, \"Grumpy Old Men.\" And \"Grumpier Old Men\" is every bit as good as the first film. It has some new characters and the scene changes from winter to summer, then winter and spring. Most reviewers don't talk about the surprise of the wedding in the first film. And I won't do that for that film or this one. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) team up for a time in the movie to plan the wedding of their daughter and son, Melanie and Jacob (played by Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak). And, later, to try to thwart the conversion of their bait shop into an Italian restaurant. Sophia Loren is the added ingredient for much humor as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti. She's a cousin of \"Spaghetti\" Ragetti, whom John and Max know. Her mother is in the picture, Mama Ragetti, played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. And, grandpa Gustafson is back, with Burgess Meredith now a couple years older. He tells son, John, as they sit by the lake drinking beer, that he sometimes thinks God has forgotten about him. The hijinks and capers in this film include some hilarious pranks the two friendly enemies pull on the Ragettis. As with the original film, this one supposedly takes place in Wabasha, Minnesota. While it is a real town on the Mississippi River border with Wisconsin, the filming for this and the earlier movie was done in a number of places around that area of southeastern Minnesota. So, anyone going to Wabasha won't find the fishing lake, the town overlook or some other scenes shown in these films. With the 10 films they made together  especially the nine comedies, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have delighted audiences for decades. May they outlive Catfish Hunter and continue amuse people for decades to come. Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5. Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Loren is still hot; Grumpy old men was an OK comedy with a nice performance by Ann-Margret, but otherwise forgettable. This film, on the other hand, has some real comic touches that actually also have something to say about the aging process - and life really doesn't end until it ends. But first the bad news: Daryl Hannah. I've liked her in other films, but she is so flat in this, she's a distraction. She doesn't have the feel for these characters, not even her own, and so doesn't quite fit. She's not even credible as the mother of the young girl who is so important in her relationship to great=grand-dad Burgess Meredith. There must have been some plot device they could have come up with to leave her out of the picture altogether; oh, well. Now the really good news: Sophia Loren. I admit I have always had a crush on her since I saw Houseboat as a kid; and when I saw the shower scene in Arabesque, i couldn't sleep for a week. Her performance here is splendid (romantic comedy is one of her strengths, after all), but the really really good news is that she was past sixty when she made this film, and she looks hot enough to burn a young man's fingers! Really - if I'd been Walter Matthau in that bar scene, I'd have gone out with a heart-attack right there - and smiling. With an adequate script, and such superb actors, Deutsch wisely lets the formula roll on without interference. Consequently, whatever the short-comings there's plenty to remember fondly from this film. Oh, and don't miss the blooper-reel that runs under the final credits - Matthau and Meredith are having a grand old time. Oh, and Sophia Loren is still hot. A vibrant sequel that's still underwhelming; I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They seem to work perfectly together, and with a better script, this movie could be gold. We are taken back to Minnesota to re-visit the old grumps who now have to plan a wedding for their very plain and very boring children. There's a reason Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah have never had substantial film careers- they're very uninteresting actors. But I digress. If \"Grumpy Old Men\" built up it's laughs, \"Grumpier Old Men\" topples them down. The best moments of both films are when Lemmon and Matthau trade vicious insults at one another, and also play pranks on each other. But when this is taken away, we're suffering every old cliché in the book, including Walter's tiresome 'Wholey Moley' line which is used so much, it could be taken into context for a Shot Party (take a shot every time Matthau 'Wholey Moley''s himself). The other problem with this series is the fact that gorgeous women fall for these two farts. Roger Ebert made a very valid point in his review for this film- first Ann-Margaret moves into the neighborhood and marries Jack Lemmon. Now the even more gorgeous Sophia Loren has set her sights on the incredibly unattractive Matthau. And why? For concepts in the plot. There's no reason a woman as beautiful and intelligent as Loren would fall for the dull and disgusting figure Matthau is. I know this is a comedy, but come on now! All in all this sequel is peppier and a little more fun then the original, but both movies suffer from overblown dramatic passages that are not needed. We want to see the old guys go at it, not Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah. I laughed a lot at this movie- mostly at the incredibly underrated Bergis Meredith as the foul-mouthed Grandpa. Since all three main actors have passed, we'll never see them again. At least Margaret and Loren are still alive and kicking. I'd love to see their movie: \"Grumpy Old Widows\". Still having a good ol' time!; I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men back to back, so I could see both instead of my normal rent one sequel at a time ordeal. I just finished Grumpier Old Men this morning and was expecting a modest sequel, but it turned into a great sequel, pretty much to the point where I enjoyed Grumpier Old Men to Grumpy Old Men. Despite the fact that they use some old jokes, this was a fun plot and I thought the guys have gotten even funnier, including John's father, he's a little dirty, but so much fun to laugh at. John and Max are now best friends again and couldn't be happier with each other, their son and daughter are about to get hitched, and they are overwhelming with the wedding plans. Max is starting to get lonely though, since Chuck has passed on, the bait shop is given to two older Italian women, one lady, Maria, starts a little feud with Max wanting to turn the bait shop into a restaurant. But their anger turns into a hidden passion and they end up falling head over heals for each other, but Maria has some hidden skeletons in her closet. Grumpier Old Men is proof that you are never too old to fall in love or have your heart broken again. It was so sweet seeing Max fall in love with Maria, I loved their passion for each other, it was so fun to watch. John's father and Maria's mother were just so awesome and funny, they had such great chemistry! I would highly recommend Grumpier Old Men, it's a great comedy that once again touches your heart and tickles your funny bone. 8/10 It has it's moments; Howard Deutch decided he wanted to cash in on the success of Grumpy Old Men and it worked. The only problem to the sequel is that some of the cast seem to be a bit bored by the proceedings. The one liners are enough to make you drop your popcorn. Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon are a joy to watch as they continue to find ways to drive each other over the edge into insanity. And yet Deutch calms that insanity by giving us a quick glimpse into just how much these two men mean to each other when Jack's dad played by Burgess Meredith dies. Lemmon and Mathau are still at the top of their game in this film. In this film the Ann Margaret character is suppose to be the rock, the sound of reason, the calm in the midst of the storm. You believe she is until she has the insanity thrust upon her and is forced to react. For the most part Ann Margaret as well as Daryl Hannah seem bored throughout the entire film. Kevin Pollack is just as good in this sequel as in the original. Burgess Meredith is the scene stealer, he manages with dead pan accuracy to deliver some of the best one liners in the film. Ann Morgan Guilbert manages to match Burgess with her ability to respond to his one liners with shock and outrage befitting her character. And then you come to Sophia. Sophia is in her comfort zone here. Sophia is comfortable with the slapstick comedy and relishes it, she's in the movie, she's not walking through it. She's absolutely stunning to watch but at the same time she adds to the moment. She's as glamorous as ever but it doesn't get in the way. All in all a good follow up to the original. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. charming and funny light romantic comedy; It may be just me but I found Grumpier Old Men way way better than Grumpy Old Men. I laughed more and got involved in the plot much more. That it is totally 100% predictable every step of the way is only one of its charms... its how you get there where the fun is. And these actors turn in surprisingly memorable performances for such a slight film. I thought Sophia Loren turned in one of her most charming and funny performances, as did everyone else. The story was just more interesting and three dimensional than the first film and flowed more organically. The story line is simple ancient classic romantic comedy that these veterans had done so many times, it seemed for them like doing a well-known dance. The fun is not in surprises but in going through the old steps with joy. The actors move through their paces with simplicity and enthusiasm and the film actually captures very well the effects of love. The whole film hangs together and works in a way that, for me, the first one didn't. It gets airborne. It deserves a higher ranking than my seven except the story is a little too well-worn. It also allows the two protagonists to get a little more real with each other. Even the three charismatic animal actors get caught up in the spirit of fun. One thing about the film that gave me trouble was that all four women being courted in the film are talented, accomplished, strong and magnificent while all four of the men are hamstrung. I found it mysterious that these women, dropped by some miracle into this tiny town, would be so strongly attracted. funny funny; I, too, found the film very funny and until reading about it here couldn't remember who played the other woman with Burgess Meredith at the end of the film, the scene that made the whole film complete.  Without giving away what happened at the end of the film, the other woman was that gorgeous elder lady of many great films - Sophia Loren.  What a delicious surprise!  Good also for any old grumpy man! the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... not much fun; Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still combative while maintaining their truce. John is married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) now and his father (Burgess Meredith) is still spry. Everybody is chasing after the big fish Catfish Hunter. Meanwhile, their children Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are planning to get married. Newcomer Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in Wabasha to buy the bait shop and turn it into an Italian restaurant. It's a continuation that's missing much of the fun. It is contrived. It's great to see these great actors working together but that's all I got out of it. I found very few laughs. after you have seen the first there is no point seeing this one; After the fun of watching Lemmon and Matthau act like kids for less than 2 hours (i.e. from the first movie) I was satisfied, but then due to the success of the first movie the producers decided to give it another twirl, this time the story had the two starting off as friends thanks to the incidents that happened in the ending of the first film, but then some really really idiotic stupid reason, they were at it again. The movie was not funny as it was like a replay of the first, same pranks, similar plot and screenplay made this movie a waste of time. After getting a mate for John, they (the producers) decided to get a mate for Max, with nothing to write home about but a lame script that just showed no finesse or true plan, just the producers hoping to bank on the success of the previous movie. The main disappointment in the movie for me was Sophia Loren; her acting was just too weak for me to understand that she is a star. Everybody else in the movie even Burgess Meredith (who had Alzheimer's disease and this was his last motion picture appearance) was impressive, at least that I can give them. The movie is directed this time by Howard Deutch, who later worked with the duo in 1998 for Odd Couple II, Deutch other movies also have not been well received like Getting Even with Dad (1994) and The Whole Ten Yards (2004), which are basically the reason why I will not bother seeing My Best Friend's Girl. The movie plot carries on 6 months after the incidents of the first, where both John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) were getting prepared for the wedding of their children. Then a new arrival in town a beautiful lady by the name of Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) came in to change things by turning the towns bait shop to a restaurant. John and Max join forces to try and run the new lady out of town, but the issues between John and Max's children marriage plan caused both to reignite their feud as both refused to believe that their child was at fault. Only the ladies are alive till today (February 2013), as both Lemmon and Matthau died like half a decade after this movie release. Grumpier Old Men was a box office success in its own part, but a huge critical disappointment, as the movie cost 10 million dollars less than its predecessor and made like a million more in the box office. After you have seen the first there is basically no point why you should bother seeing this one, because it will stand in my mind as one movie I credit as a waste of time and talent. www.lagsreviews.com Funnier than the first!; This movie is downright hilarious with tons of good one-liners. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (may they both rest in peace) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max &amp; John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says \"Holy moly\" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor! As Good As The Original; Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\". I don't agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love \"Buddy Buddy\" and \"The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile. Pretty Dang Funny; John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. We often expect sequels to be weaker than the original. But sometimes we may be pleasantly surprised. In this sequel, the \"grumpy old men\" are still up to their old tricks, going after each other and teaming up to close down a restaurant. Some of it may be a bit far-fetched (in real life, a store owner would get the cops involved) but it's good fun. Sadly, the film has the distinction of being Burgess Meredith's final film. On the plus side, he really goes out with a bang. His acting and delivery of witty lines is top notch, and the film does a great job of hiding his Alzheimer's. You can really feel the talent in his character. Grumpy, but not funny; What, I wonder, does the legendary Billy Wilder think of this film starring Lemmon and Matthau, the great team he so memorably paired in 1966's \"The Fortune Cookie\"?  Wilder's film is a dark, cynical satire, and was the first of what is now seven films starring the pair.  Seven films, but only two of them--\"The Fortune Cookie\" and \"The Odd Couple\"--are genuinely funny efforts showcasing these actors' combined talents.  \"Grumpy Old Men\" was mildly amusing due less to the script than to the welcome return of Lemmon and Matthau who hadn't been on screen together in 12 years.  The unexpected box-office bonanza naturally inspired a sequel, but all this equally lucrative outing has in its favor is a brief monologue by Burgess Meredith who, as Lemmon's 95-year-old father, boasts of eating bacon and smoking Camels while the \"experts\" who warned against such vices are taking a \"dirt nap.\"  Not even Lemmon and Matthau can enliven the script by Mark Steven Johnson this time around.  The curmudgeonly Matthau admitted he didn't lke the script for the first film but did it to work with Lemmon, and that the only reason he did the sequel is because the first film was a hit.  No doubt, \"Grumpiest Old Men,\" the inevitable sequel, will be just as dreary. If these pictures make big bucks, why tamper with the formula?  Why hire Billy Wilder to punch up the quality when the public seems content merely to see Lemmon and Matthau rather than see them at their best? Is it better than original?; Is this movie better than the original? Perhaps. It's probably funnier than the original. Walter Matthau's pick-up line is one of the funniest things of the movie. But is it better than the original? The original had more of the emotions of Lemmon and Matthau as they fought. This one has less feuding (but still has some of the old pranks) and more focus on the family / dating relationships of the old men. This movie is funny and definitely worth watching. You'll have to decide on your own if it's better than the original. Mini Ha Has In Minnesota; It's just possible that the intention was to shoot four Grumpy Old Men titles featuring the four seasons because after the Winter setting of the first one we are now in Summer though theoretically such a cycle should have begun with Spring and ended with Winter so maybe the cyclical thing was an afterthought. Whatever we have virtually the same cast doing virtually the same thing with one absentee and two replacements one of which, Anna Guilbert is actually a native of Minneapolis adding a touch of authenticity. If it was unrealistic that Ann Margaret - who, after all, was teaching English at university and would by definition have access to dozens of eligible males - would marry Jack Lemmon in the first film it is equally unrealistic that Sophia Loren would wed Walter Mattheau here other than for feelgood reasons. On the other hand it's probably churlish to nitpick in this way when the film is only intended to entertain. Which it does. As equally funny as the original, but with an Italian flair!!!!; This sequel to Grumpy Old Men is as funny as the original. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and the rest of the cast from the original movie reprise their roles. John and Max are still feuding, but the tension between them has softened. There are, however, some changes: Ariel and John are married and there's a new girl in town named Maria Ragetti. She's moved to Wabasha to open up an Italian restaurant at the former Chuck's Bait place. When the boys discover what Maria's intentions are, they hatch a scheme to ruin the grand opening of the restaurant and try to keep Chuck's business going, even though the inventory of the former business has been cleared out and the interior remodeled to look like an Italian restaurant. Max and Sophia meet, but there's a disagreement about what the place should be. Maria goes to the neighborhood bar to try and reason with Max, but to no avail. It seems as though Max and John have trouble saying goodbye to what is no longer there. The humor between Lemmon and Matthau's characters is still spiced up and is still able to put viewers in stitches. Then, Max and Maria get married, and the restaurant starts selling bait, as well. Great movie, great cast, great fun!! Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. 2/5 stars - John Ulmer \"Good Lemmon &amp; Matthau Comedy Sequel!\"; Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Kevin Pollack, Daryl Hannah and Burgess Meredith star in this 1995 comedy sequel. This takes place about 6 months later where John (Lemmon) is now married to Ariel (Margret) and he and Max (Matthau) are sort of getting along. This time, Max finds romance when he meets Maria Ragetti (Loren), an Italian widow who moves into town and opens a restaurant. Jacob (Pollack) and Melanie (Hannah) are also engaged and things start to get a bit difficult for them which makes their dads feud with each other, but only temporarily. The late, Meredith (Rocky) also returns as John's father and this was his final film. This is a good sequel and like the first film, it provides laughs and a bit of heartfelt moments as well. I recommend this. The good, the bad, and the just plain miserable...again; It's not uncommon for a movie sequel to do little to the formula that made its predecessor so financially (and hopefully critically) successful. The old \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" method of filmmaking has been used in the Hangover, Home Alone, and Taken franchise to only modest success in terms of quality. However, in Grumpier Old Men, the sequel to the fine comedy Grumpy Old Men, handles the rehashed formula better than many film sequels do. While I'm getting to sound repetitive and out of descriptive words, this is largely because of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's chemistry together on-screen. From the moment they appear, it's almost impossible to believe the men's friendship in real life wasn't lifelong and consisted largely of playful torment, vulgarity, and several boys nights out. Had the film been a sequel with few returning cast members (say Lemmon and Matthau were substituted by two other actors), this sequel would've likely been a somber affair to view. In a way, I'm thankful the town of Wabasha Minnesota hasn't really changed much since our last outing, with the exception of John Gustafson (Jack Lemon) marrying Ariel (Ann-Margret) from the original film. In the meantime, John's dad still lives off a diet of beer, cigarettes, and bacon and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), John's cantankerous neighbor, still finds himself engaging in petty neighborhood battles with John about outwitting the other man. However, the big ordeal this time is not competing for a new neighbor's love but trying to save a local bait shop from becoming a \"restaurante\" for Italian cuisine. The restaurant is managed by Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren), a gorgeous but uncompromisingly strict woman who catches the eye of Max even as him and Jack plan to foil the restaurant's forthcoming prosperity. Other events (aka subplots) occurring in Wabasha are the wedding between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah), a plot which would later be used by the same director Howard Deutch in The Odd Couple II, also starring Lemmon and Matthau, along with John trying to get his father (Burgess Meredith in his final role, which was burdened by spouts with Alzheimer's and difficultly remembering lines, some female company as he gets older. One of Grumpier Old Men's immediate issues is that there is simply too much going on between plot-strands that involve marriage/romance troubles (I counted four including John's brief trouble with Ariel later in the movie) ad others that involve trying to sabotage the bait-shop-turned-restaurant. Grumpier Old Men may have too many new ideas for cutesy subplots, but it keeps the tone and feel of its predecessor alive and well. It still feels like Wabasha is the location of a sitcom with its oddball situations that seem to consistently bear hefty consequences for its residents, but its characters still feel like real people we've come to known and care about. Unsurprisingly, Lemmon and Matthau share unbelievable conversational beauty in the way they engage in simple discussions that seem to constantly end in uproariously funny bickering. Once you minimize your focus on that aspect in the film, you have just an average comedy that, while charming and pleasantly safe (a good and bad quality for this particular kind of picture), is just grateful to be buoyed by two very talented leading men. Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Sophia Loren, and Burgess Meredith. Directed by: Howard Deutch. Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life &amp; Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau &amp; Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman &amp; John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a 7.4 out of 10 Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. Grumpier Old Men (1995) **1/2; More of the same for those who enjoyed the first film, nothing great but a decent time killer. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return in their twilight years as the ever-battling duo, but this time with the added attraction of Sophia Loren who still looks gorgeous at age 60. She winds up posing a threat to their favorite bait and tackle shop when she decides to take it over and turn it into an Italian restaurant. Since Lemmon's already got sexy Ann-Margret as his hot girlfriend, Sophia hits it off with old man Matthau (ah, the magic of movies), who does not look as good for his age (75). Burgess Meredith is better used in this one in his role as Lemmon's naughty old pop. **1/2 out of **** Who would have ever guessed that it's the same place?; For the most part, \"Grumpier Old Men\" is pretty silly. Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still at each other's throats when Italian immigrant Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in town and throws everything into flux. What actually struck me most about the movie was how different the town looked in this one from the original. Obviously, it was a different time of year, but maybe the different look was meant to show how everything might be changing in the town. Other than that, Ann-Margret returns as Ariel, and she's still as free-spirited and vivacious as she was in the original. Burgess Meredith - in his final role - is still the grandfather who can exercise absolute authority over the youngsters, although he now has the hots for Maria's mother (Ann Morgan Guilbert, aka Millie on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\"). Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah also reprise their roles from the original...ah, and there's that fish. All in all, a fairly interesting movie. Not any kind of masterpiece, but it showed that Lemmon and Matthau still had it. Grumpier Old Men Too Sedate *; While Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were an excellent team, they bombed in this film but good. What's so grumpy about Lemmon in this film? The prequel was much better. Ann Guilbert, as Sophia Loren's mother, is given little to do. Remember her as the grandmother to \"The Nanny?\" Sophia Loren, other than marrying Matthau, is also give nothing to do. Ditto for Ann-Margret, Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak, all of whom were so good in the original but are reduced to practically nothing here. I also resent Matthau, who shows off his part-Jewish heritage marrying in a church at the end. I found this to be offensive. Sorry, but that's the way I am-old fashioned. To all those criticize me for the last statement, how would you have felt if the Matthau-Loren nuptials had taken place in a synagogue? While I realize that this was a comedy, this still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. A non-religious setting would have been the only solution to this. great; This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) Sweet and Sad; In this bright sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\" we find John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) at it again. The rivalry never stops. This time, they are bickering over their children's nuptials, almost causing a wedding not to occur. Sophia Loren co-stars as Maria in this foray into the land of 10,000 lakes as the new girl in town that Max has an eye for. At first, they both hate one another because she is turning his beloved tackle shop into a restaurant. Comedy ensues as Max and John both try to get the restaurant shut down and condemned. Eventually, as in the first film, love finds a way. However, sadness veils over as well when Burgess Meredith's character dies. Other than that, the film is very enjoyable. Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from 1995. The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe 8yrs old, and must have seen it over 100 x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it 15 minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. Great!; This is a rare sequel. Wait a minute, sequels aren't rare. Well, that's true, but a *good* sequel is rare. Most of the time, sequels aren't even in the same league as the originals. However, due to excellent writing, a superb cast and great direction, this film is every bit as enjoyable as Grumpy Old Men. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made several films together and they worked together extremely well. The gorgeous Ann Margaret reprises her role from the first film and is now Lemmon's wife. A new lady hits town and Matthau is very interested. This lovely creature is played by Sophia Loren, who is still stunningly beautiful. Burgess Meredith is great as Grandpa. The stellar cast ensures great acting. However, this film is also written such that there is literally a laugh nearly every minute. I found the film to be highly enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh. Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the 1st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. One of the best movies of 1995!; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter &amp; Jack's previous films together. It was this film &amp; the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max &amp; John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down. forget the fussing; As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Good Laughs; Grumpier Old Men (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to Grumpy Old Men have Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau returning with more fights and foul language. This time out Lemmon is still happily married but Matthau is on the move and takes a special interest in an Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved to town. I think the most remarkable thing about this film is how well Loren looked. Even at 61 she's still a head turner and her comic timing isn't too bad either. I'm sure this film was only made because the first one made money but it doesn't really matter as no one should take this too serious as it's just a silly comedy meant to make you laugh. There are plenty of nice laughs here but I don't think it's as good as the original. This certainly isn't in the league as The Odd Couple but we do get a pretty good throwback to that film here as there's a scene where Lemmon has to spend the night with Matthau but can't put up with his dirty house. Ann-Margret returns but is pretty much wasted as is Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak. The perverted Burgess Meredith is back and steals the scene every time he's in it. Both Matthau and Lemmon are naturally very good and they easily slip back into their roles. It's priceless watching the two men work together even when the material isn't as strong as one would hope. Lemmon gets a special notice here due to a very touching scene with Meredith. Another problem is the direction, which has one of those \"made for TV\" feels to it. In the end this film could have and should have been a lot better but the cast make it worth watching. Sophia, twenty years later at 80, is still spectacular.; I saw a picture of Sophia on her eightieth birthday, demurely covering herself with a sheet and a heart-melting smile. All I could think of was the scene where she hitched up her bra and marched through the bar, and every man looked, and I do mean every man. I read later that she had \"improved\" the script for that. A reviewer in the SF Chronicle wrote later that she said she had had no \"touch- ups\", and if so then \"her genes need investigating.\" I remember her many films where her beauty was so natural that it was a wonder any man could concentrate on his lines. She never traded on it, but on her talent as an actress. Carlo Ponti was a lucky man: beauty without guile, talent without pretense. Italian pizza were like street food. When she heard we had so many pizza parlors, she thought we must be a poor country. Then she visited, and dined on American pizza. She reconsidered, gracefully and graciously.</td>\n",

I love to see miserable people hate a movie just because...well, they have nothing to better to do. Not saying this was the best movie I've ever seen. But I agree with others who say that Bassett and Levine are the ones to save this film from drowning with all the other horrible movies. I love Angela Bassett, I'm a huge fan of hers. The scene which depicts the morning after her husband leaves her for his secretary, which would've otherwise been too cliché for my taste had it not been for the way Bernie (Bassett) burned up that BMW! I mean that was classic. Sorry if any of you testosterone-fueled men out there will accuse me of man hating, but I love that scene and will watch it over and over again. Three cheers for Angie. And Devine's character, Gloria seems sort of weak and unable to stand up to even her teenage son, but I love how she bends a little and confesses how she feels to the late Gregory Hines' character. You'll notice Devine's Gloria and Bassett's Bernie are slightly juxtaposed but their chemistry is excellent. If you haven't seen it, check it out, if not for anything but the performance of these two gifted actors. Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" This film does Terry McMillan's writing no justice; This movie had great potential had it landed in the right directors hands (as seen with How Stella got Her Groove Back).  Many rough cuts, sloppy editing, and terrible lighting at times to name a few.  Casting was excellent with the exception of Whitney Houston who has the tendency to over-chew her scenes.  Though much of the book was not adapted to the film the strength and love amongst four friends was apparent.  It was the one thing that was not lost or left on the cutting room floor.  Good movie, better book. Waiting to Exhale (the movie) ***** (5 stars) Waiting to Exhale (the novel) ********** (ten stars) A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . Feel Good Movie; The acting in this film is phenomenal, especially on the part of Angela Bassett who always does an amazing job (see What's Love Got To Do With It). The inter-cuts work well where they are placed, much like all of the other shots, and keep the films pace and the viewer interested. I've read other user comments and I find their opinions to be completely biased and unwarranted. If you're watching this film looking for profound insight to life you will be disappointed. This film is an adaptation of Terry McMillan's critically acclaimed novel FOR BLACK FEMALES. Waiting to Exhale explores the lives of four female friends. Each woman makes mistakes and has to deal with those consequences. But it is through being there for one another that they overcome these problems and others. For me, most of the negative user comments are from people who the film was not made for, that are only analyzing the film from the story. There is more to a film than it's narrative and when base your full opinion on that alone you are missing out. Plus, for me, it's just flat-out annoying when people who are completely not the target audience bash a film. Note: this is not to say that art cannot breach color, age or sex barriers. But be let's be realistic for a moment. If say, a heterosexual, black, 21 year old female studying Art was asking you for a good movie suggestion for a Friday night...Would you suggest The Dukes Of Hazard? I think not. Not unless you were joking. Sticky; There was nothing in the movie that made me excited. The message did not come through,  if there was one. Perhaps it is to convey the idea that men are useless,  or that relations are complicated because women make it complicated. If a comedy,  I did not laugh.  If a drama,  I did not find it dramatic. It was like drinking a cup of coffee presented to you with way too much sugar. Whitney ruined the great potential; Angela Basset was good as expected, but Whitney has no Range as an actress. The screenplay also neglected to portray, on film, the greatness of this novel.  Instead of promoting sisterhood, they emphasized the canine-qualities of men.  Read the book; rent Soul Food instead! Excellent for the broken heart...; Perhaps the reason they call this movie a chick flick, is because that's exactly who it's aimed at. Women. I don't see this as a man bashing movie, but more as a \"how do you deal?\" type of movie. It covers every situation: The unworthy co-worker, The drug-addict boyfriend, the gay husband, the cheating husband, the married man, the New Years fling, the sweet attractive neighbor, the teenage son....but most importantly, it show how women react and deal with the lies, the cheating, and the friendships between both men AND women...and how to survive from that. Any woman who has ever gone through a relationship can relate to this movie, regardless of race, situation, or age. You will want to scream, cry and laugh throughout the whole movie, and I can guarantee that every woman has got a little Angela Bassett in her, especially when she rips through her ex-husbands belongings. Two thumbs up...A definite must-see for any woman with a wounded heart. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about 15 or 16 and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. A real disaster!; This movie is awful! The caracters are shallow and almost ridiculous, especially Lela Rochon. It's a very, very, very bad soap opera. I was watching this movie with my wife and we were laughing almost all the time. It is much too long, with no rhythm with absolutely no emotions. It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one cliché after another. Skip it, it's a waste of time! Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this 1995 film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Pathetic; This film is simply about a bunch of women who pick men who's behaviors they claim to hate &amp; then spend the rest of their time complaining about them. It seems that this view is held by many women &amp; possibly accounts in some measure to the number of women who consider their relationships with men to be unsatisfying. My favorite movie ever !; I'm so surprised by the comments i read here. Since i saw that movie maybe 10 years ago now, it's one of my favorite movie ever along with boomerang.Maybe it's because i was fairly young when i watched those movies.. but i find them extremely good. I watched the movie before i read the book and it may be the reason why i loved the movie so much. Sure Whitney's acting could have been better but she managed to do a pretty decent job overall. As for the soundtrack it's a pure bliss for RnB lovers and i would say a classic now. The image of Black men in the movie is very negative but in a sens it pushed to be the exact opposite so it kinda shaped my vision and my life, and \"deepend\" my love of black women. Some parts of the movie are just so classic like the break up between Robin and troy on the balcony and the soundtrack at that moment was some kind of a symphony.. anyways great great movie .. enjoy Extra in Movie; I was actually an extra in this movie and had a quite a fun time hanging out w/the cast/crew. I had an opportunity to be at several of the locations for days of filming and it was a lot of work. You don't realize what a day of filming entitles until you actually do it and I was just an extra. I was more interested in the process of the film making than being on camera so it was a great opportunity. I even got \"spoiled\" and met a lot of the cast and drove around in the SUV's that are for the main cast...fun stuff! I think over all the movie was to enjoy for fun. I think the basis of the friendships were the most important aspect of the film. That through all the craziness of men in their lives they were still there for one another. hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Hilarious in Parts; 1995 was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in 1995, the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker. 6 of 10 stars. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT.

You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. in response to your response; I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :) I wanna move to Arizona; I thought It was a great movie, although it is a lot of sleeping with other women husband that are taken, we all have to be honest, this goes on a lot in reality. it's not right, but it happens.... Overall I really enjoy the movie because it took me way back to 1995, the movie was great. great times, although I was just 11 when it came out, I remember all the hype over this movie from my mom n my aunts.... One factor that I've never notice before was the setting... It makes me wanna pack up my family an move to peaceful Arizona.. Great Movie. r.i.p. Whitney Houston I cannot believe it took me all this time to see this movie all the way through... WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. I give this one 2 out of 10. FAbuLOuS; Simply fabulous. I thought it was a great movie. I was completely empowered! It made me want to start my exes car on fire. Embrace your independence  watch this movie. (is great to watch with the scorned over glasses of wine and bon bons) It'll make you laugh, cry, get mad, and then plot getting even. I can waste a lot of your time telling you to see it, defending it from what others say about it, or just generally talking it up. But haven't you always wanted to see Angela Basset throw a fit? How bout cut her hair off? And who wouldn't want to watch Whitney act with humility. This is by far my favorite movie with Whitney - second, The Bodyguard - third, The Preachers Wife. Frustrating...; That's the word I'd use to describe the film, an adaptation of Terry McMillan's 1992 best-seller. It's not great, it's not bad, but it's frustrating to watch, and the fact that I'm of the male persuasion undoubtedly had something to do with it. Now, let me be the first to say that I did enjoy seeing a group of strong black women portrayed onscreen. To say that Hollywood has been exceedingly lax in this regard is an understatement. But it would've been nice if their collective talents hadn't been squandered on this disgustingly anti-male tirade. Especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine, who otherwise shine in everything their names are attached to. Good, solid movies about sisterhood are probably needed now more than ever, but not at the cost of shortchanging the good, upright, decent brothers out there, whom this movie largely forgets about (with some notable exceptions -- Gregory Hines, for example.) And the frustration doesn't end there. Both Savannah and Robin manage to find themselves involved with the most shady characters (a married man and a dope fiend, respectively), yet they complain about the lack of good men out there. I suppose it would be silly to question just where they've been looking, even though it might hold the answer. The sad thing is that there are fellas out there who have little to no regard for women (\"the scum of the f__king earth\", to quote Savannah), and women who fall for fellas like that for the most silly, shallow reasons. If it wasn't for Bassett, Devine, and Babyface's score, this movie would barely be watchable. As it is, it's a moderately entertaining diversion, albeit a frustrating one. Don't Exhale Just Yet; I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It's not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others, it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However, the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria -- even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger, Holly Hunter, Alfre Woodard and others. Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight, insecure no-nonsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight, but she was the only one who found it (and deserved it). She was the only one who didn't sleep around, wasn't a man basher, set a good example for her son, and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face -- look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things, her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent, good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie. Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package --- beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life - she could now start her catering business, she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end. Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book, you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men. Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same -- Whitney Houston being well groomed, pretending to be well spoken and classy, and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise (although she might have been too young). The character had to tell us she was smart -- in a phone conversation with her mother she said \"I'm smart, I'm a good person and I work hard.\" Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills, doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end. This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn't \"tell this story\" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were. Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue? Sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE HARD TRUTH) looked VERY beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts REALLY made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Good movie, Better book; This wasn't a bad movie. The acting was great (although Whitney Houston still seems mediocre). Some of the scenes were powerful and funny. However, unlike the book which also deals with the sisterhood of Black women, the movie becomes a long \"Men are pigs\" tirade that gets weary after a while. Plus it's sometimes hard to root for the characters. For instance, considering all the one-night stands Savannah has, it's hard to see why she's questioning her ability to find a good man. Overall, Waiting to Exhale, is basically a sorely-needed bonding movie for African-American women that, while a little biased, is good escapist fun. Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops &amp; horrible movies. A One-Sided Celebration of African American Feminism; Directed by Forest Whitaker and adapted from a smash best selling novel by Terry McMillan, WAITING TO EXHALE is a glossy, but one-sided look at the relationship between four strong black women and the various men in their lives. The film is one-sided because the screenplay presents most of the male characters as sexist, manipulative pigs without a redeeming characteristic in sight, but the sensitive direction and outstanding performances keep the rather lopsided story watchable. Whitney Houston made an impressive film debut as Savannah, an ambitious television executive caught in a dead-end affair with a married man (Dennis Haysbert). Angela Basset does Oscar-worthy work as Bernadine, a woman who has spent her life being the best wife and mother she knows how to be, who has her world rocked when her wealthy husband (Michael Beach) calmly announces one night before a formal dinner party that he's in love with someone else and wants a divorce. The scene where Bernadine gathers all her husband's stuff and makes a bonfire out of it in her driveway is one of the film's highlights. Lela Rochon plays Robin, a not-too-bright doormat who finds herself pregnant by a man she wants nothing to do with. Loretta Devine is fun as Gloria, a hairdresser who is divorced from her husband, who it turns out was gay, and is struggling to raise her son (Donald Faison) and tries to begin a relationship with a new neighbor (Gregory Hines). If you can accept the fact that in the world of these four women, all men are pigs, then this film can be very entertaining but the top-notch performances by the cast cannot be overlooked. A bit too soapy but deserves respect for being a positive film for black women; Vannah is travelling to see her friend Bernie while leaving behind all her old live to start anew.  Bernie has just been left by her husband of 13 years for a white woman.  Robin wants to be loved and happy but always makes the wrong choices.  Glo has an estranged husband and the only man in her life is her teenage son.  The four get together through their struggles in love and live as they try to put it all together again. This is very much a woman's film and, as a man, it's easy for me to criticise it for being a weepy or for being a bit of a woman love in, so I won't.  The plot is pure soap opera, the lives and loves of our 4 women, however it is still involving as the four stories all have strengths as well as weaknesses.  The mix of comedy and sentiment is a bit too much 20:80 and at times the sentiment gets too much, but the sassy characters keep the interest. The soapy sentiment isn't helped by a poor soundtrack and poor use there of. In itself I like some of the love ballad r'n'b stuff  but here it felt like it was all over every scene.  This really bogs it down. Also a down side is the whole man hating thing  only a few come off looking good.  I thought the director being a man would help redress the balance but it seemed to have no effect. Why  can someone tell me  was Houston chosen to lead this talented black cast?  Was it because she could do a cut price soundtrack?  She's a poor actress and he spoiled her scenes  she needs to stay in TVM's.  Bassett however is powerful as ever and really steals every single scene she's in.  Devine adds comedy and sauce while Rochon is perfect as the vulnerable beauty going about love the wrong way.  The male cast is great too  there are so many well known faces in this with only two criticisms of them  1  everytime I see Haysbert now all I can think of is his 24 character.  And 2  Wesley Snipes' character just don't convince me at all. Overall to criticise this for being girly or sentimental is to miss the point.  It is actually good to see a film with so many good roles for black actresses.  It's a bit too soapy for my taste but it is funny and involving with a commanding Bassett.  Only Huston, a soppy soundtrack and constant man caricatures spoil it. Double Standard; So I finally got around to watching \"Waiting to Exhale\" on Encore the other night and I don't understand why this became a hit. (Note: spoilers ahead) As far as I can tell, the basic premise of this film is that all men are insensitive, callous and unfeeling; especially towards women. Okay, well and good. That is the storyline? Fine. Men suck, got it. But there is a huge double standard here; two of the women are dating married men and clearly, we are meant to be sympathetic about their plight as they whine and cry about not having \"their\" man with them at night in bed. How about this? STOP DATING MARRIED MEN! Maybe that's your problem in the first place. Now, on the flip side, Angela Basset's character is abandoned by her husband for another woman. Yet, if you pay attention, even this character is not completely innocent. When her husband informs her he is leaving, the things she says makes it clear she's known about his lover(s) for years but ignored his infidelities. Why? Obviously, because he's so wealthy. She liked all the \"stuff\" a little too much to have confronted him about it. Again, she's made her bed here, not as completely as the two who are actively cheating, but still. She spends the rest of the movie being so angry that he left her you never really grow to like her. Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer; he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar. With their clothes on, which apparently means it's oh-so-platonic and sweet. Then he writes her a letter months later, thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off, he'll contact her again. Did anyone else think this was more than a little sleazy? I would hope if I were dying of breast cancer that my husband wasn't out sleeping around (and I do mean just sleeping) with other women. Sweet, platonic, whatever; I think it's pretty horrible. Bottom line; the characters you're supposed to connect to are unlikable and the ones you're supposed to hate are just pathetic. Not very enjoyable. However, I did give it three stars for the music, which didn't suck too badly and the clothes and style. It's a nice little snapshot of how things looked in '95. And the print wasn't very faded. That's about it, though. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Hot Soundtrack, Terrible Character Development; Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end.  It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.  However, much of this is wasted on poor character development.  Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover.  What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies.  While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all.  For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script.  Clearly the answer is that it isn't.  Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with.  Why the director didn't see this, I don't know. Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface. 4/10 Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. A 3 is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. not bad; this movie and its story are quite good on the whole..........Ms Bassett is the leading and the best actress,for sure.I get her character.she's beautiful and I guess she's blown people away with her beauty and the EASE WITH WHICH SHE FASCINATES.Ms HOUSTON IS NOT TO NEGLECT NEITHER.She looks natural in this one.And despite her little experience as far as her actress career is concerned,she is good even though her story is a bit common .Loretta is divine!Anyways,this motion picture is merely good.There's nothing amazing.And it don't stand out from all the other movies.the only thing that makes me stick to the screen is the complicity and the crude humor on men of the four ladies! Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life. Please. great touching story; While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life's mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation. WAITING TO EXHALE : Waiting To Go Somewhere, But Sadly It Never Does...; WAITING TO EXHALE Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. \"Waiting To Exhale\", Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book, had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it's star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene. \"Waiting To Exhale\" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone. It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn't know the word \"feelings\" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change. For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they've experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don't seem to learn squat. It's like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. \"Waiting To Exhale\" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose. ... D ... Great female flick of the '90s!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track 6: This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A (Rare) Good Sequel; The first \"Father of the Bride\" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin's great comedic \"Dad\" character with the emotions of marrying off his \"only\" (to that point!) daughter. However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor. Thankfully, \"Father of the Bride II\" does not fall into this trap. With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather. Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton). Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women! Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments. Whereas the first film captured George's equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George's identity crisis. With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family. Overall, this film is just as good as the original. The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare. Let's just say that if a \"Grandfather of the Bride\" were in the works, I would be first in line. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in 1995. It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. 2.5 out of 5 stars. Deja Vu; I found this sequel to be both charming and entertaining. What I learned tonight is that this movie is actually a remake of the 1951 movie \"Father's Little Dividend\", which in turn was the sequel to the original \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and with the same great cast: Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Bennett, et al.  They both share the same broad comedy and story line (only one pregnancy in the earlier version though), and in their own ways are equally entertaining.  Old or new incarnations, however, be sure to see parts one and two in sequence. Better than the original; This one is definitely better than the original, funnier, smoother pace, and in some places, better acting! Plus Martin Short has more screen time. Great! This is a great movie for anyone who like good clean comedy. Awesome! Five out of Five Moose Stars! Father of the Bride II; Likable, but not as impressive a follow up to the 1991 hit with Martin now dealing with his daughter being pregnant...And, oh yeah...his wife is pregnant again too. Entertaining, but the premise has been worn thin -- it's sweet, but unnecessary.; The original \"Father of the Bride\" with Spencer Tracey is a really good comedy, the remake starring Steve Martin is a good sweet-natured, amiable enough comedy - and I don't really think a sequel was necessary at all. I mean the whole premise is basically the same - before George Banks (Martin) had to grasp the reality of his daughter being married, and now he has to come to grips with the fact that she's having a baby. A nice twist on this is that his wife (played by Diane Keaton) is ALSO pregnant, but nevertheless it's still (basically) the same as the first film in one form or another. Thankfully it doesn't seem like a total cash-in (like so many sequels of this sort do) because it has a certain charm (as did the first film) and is still remarkably entertaining, all considered. But you can tell it was made solely because of the success of the first film - even Martin Short is back with another extended cameo as Franz the wedding manager. Of course you may be wondering why he's involved with a pregnancy, since his business is weddings. Here's a hint: more $$$ for the studio. Martin is basically doing the same thing he did in the first film - the weary upper-class guy who feels overwhelmed by the state of things. Diane Keaton is still very sweet and likable as his wife. The rest of the cast (including Macaulay's little brother Kieran Culkin) range from OK to good. Martin Short, however, is yet again a stand-out and is very funny - he wasn't necessary for the plot but he is funny and a good addition to the movie regardless. Overall I'd say this is one of those sequels that didn't need to be made, but could have been a lot worse. It's sweet, it's got some good lite-comedy moments, and in general it's just an enjoyable family movie that isn't trying to be anything other than simple entertainment -- which it is. Touching even in its weak state.; Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, and kimberly Williams Paisley return in Father of the Bride Part 2. The film as a sequel was slightly disappointing, but on the whole, likeable. George and Nina Banks are in for the surprise of their lives when they find themselves middleaged and expecting their third child.  The timing is impeccable as Annie Banks-MAckenzie also realizes that she is expecting. Thus Steve MArtin embarks on a nine month journey that will consist of him building a new room for the baby, watching his daughter become a woman and overdosing on sleeping pills.  Honestly, the film made me laugh hysterically and i shed a few tears at the bittersweet ending. 3 and 1/2 stars out of five. Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video Funny Sequel; Geogre Banks is getting used to life without his precious daughter Anne.

This is my second favorite movie.My first is Father of the bride part I.This is a good movie.See it it is a great sequel.It is almost as good as the first one. Steve Martin steals the screen. AWESOME!; This movie is great!  I think it's one of the best movies ever made!  I love both Father of the Bride I and II!  I think that it is cute how they have the mother and daughter pregnant at the same time!  I hope that they come out with a Father of the Bride Part III, that would be awesome! :-) This is my favorite movie; ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is my favorite movie.  I think it is funny, sweet, and truly touches the heart.  In the sequel to the previous, Father of the Bride, George Banks (Steve Martin) is finally getting over the fact that his beloved daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams)has gotten married.  But then she shocks him with the news that she is pregnant.  Everyone else is thrilled, but George is not.  He believes that he is too young to be a grandfather.  He tries to become young, but doesn't succeed.  Then, both he and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton) are shocked to find out that Nina is also pregnant.  George now thinks he is too old to be a father.  They have one other child other then Annie, Matty (Kieren Culkin.)  Through the chaotic turns of pregnancy, George learns to except the fact that his daughter has grown up and moved on, even though it is hard.  They also have to deal with Fronk (Martin Short,) the goofy wedding coordinator from the first movie, who is now designing the new baby's room.  They then discover that Annie has been given the opportunity to design a museaum in Boston, far away from their own, San Marino, California.  George now realizes that he will miss his daughter more then ever, but he learns to get along.  In the end, he enjoys being a grandfather to baby George, and a father again, to Megan, named after the doctor who delievered her.  In this funny and heartwarming sequel, everyone puts out fantastic performences once again.  Even though I very much enjoy Father of the Bride, I enjoy this much more. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. The Best Movie of All Time; let me tell you.. anyone who does not like the movie is just a little close minded.. i read comments that thought the movie was too unrealistic but thats what makes it so great! i mean look at other movies such as lord of the rings or star wars neither or them contain true reality.. this is why its a movie. Anyway, i loved Steve martin in this movie. he does a magnificent job of playing the character for an over protective dramatic father. he was the best actor. who could have played the part of Nina as well as Diane Keaton. she makes the part of the mom annoyingly overwhelming mother, which is exactly what the point of us as the audience to think of her. martin short is the best of all \"fra'nk's\". the way he seeks George banks's approval is perfect. and lastly Kimberly Williams is the gorgeous daughter we are all expecting her to be.. i watch this movie every night before bed and i can recite every word to this movie. because of father of the bride II i have dreamed to meet Steve martin.. \"hes my hero!!\" hopefully you fall in love with it too. and dream to be pregnant with your mother as did Annie banks. A Well-Done Sequel!; A sequel to immensely likable Father of the Bride, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is A Well-Done Sequel! Its enjoyable as well as emotional! 'Father of the Bride Part II' Synopsis: George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. 'Father of the Bride Part II' is worthy sequel of a wonderful prequel. The characters still appeal, the humor works &amp; the emotional moments are heartfelt as well. Nancy Meyers &amp; Charles Shyer's Screenplay is genuinely well-done. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography &amp; Editing are fair. Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains. On the whole, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is a satisfying sequel. A so so sequel; 'Father of the bride' was a good film and probably didn't need a sequel. But this is Hollywood, everything needs a sequel. While it is clear that a lot of effort has gone into making this sequel work, the central idea stretches credibility and every idea the writer had seems to have been thrown at the wall in a desperate attempt to get laughs. There are moments that remind you of the heart and humour that the preceding film had, but it's a load of nothing really. I went into this film dubious about how good it could be, and I didn't finish watching it any more convinced that the original needed a sequel. daughter gets married; In the sequel to Father of the Bride we have the daughter getting married and moving away from home, this presents a big dilemma to the father played of course by Steve Martin. Maybe not quite as funny as the first one,, or as good,, but definitely above average,, it's always a pleasure watching Steve Martin work at his craft. The movie is basically about how the family,, especially the parents deal with their young daughter growing up,, getting married, and eventually moving away from the nest.. the cameo from Eugene Levy is just wonderful,, as a real estate agent who is trying to sell the very home where our main character lives.. all in all a very family friendly movie,, that I would recommend. Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. Better than the first one!; I love Steve Martin, but I was disappointed by the first movie, so I wasn't expecting as much from this one.  But to my surprise, this one was even better! It's constantly funny, just like one should expect from Steve Martin; it's not preoccupied with corny emotion, like the first movie was. It's Steve Martin in his best performance since \"My Blue Heaven.\" Sometimes sequels can be surprisingly good.  This one is better.  It has all the comedic elements that were stagnant in the first movie.  It's everything the first movie should have been, and more! Father of the Bride Part II; The first film was the remake of the original version starring Spencer Tracy and Dame Elizabeth Taylor, and it became very popular, so naturally they felt like a sequel was needed to continue the story. Basically George Banks (Golden Globe nominated Steve Martin) is getting used to the fact that his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) has become the bride now wife and got married to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), and more surprisingly a mother when she reveals she is pregnant. With this revelation comes out George has a small midlife crisis, and he tries to recapture his youth, including dying his hair, but he does eventually settle somewhat and get used to the idea that he will be a grandfather. But then he is shocked to find out he will be a father again as well when his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) reveals that she is also pregnant, and it may appear that both her and Annie's baby will be born on the same day. With these things happening, and the house having leaks and termites there is the opportunity to change things by selling the house to Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy), but he changes his mind later. When George manages to get the house back, despite a higher price, he gets the help of camp wedding planner/coordinator, now interior designer, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) to make the baby rooms and get things ready for the arrival of children. There are a couple of false alarms from Annie where she thinks the baby is coming, but eventually it comes to the real thing, and they rush to hospital, and of course Nina goes in to labour as well. In the end George is very happy to be holding both his new baby son and his new baby granddaughter is his arms, before his daughter and her husband move away to their own new home. Also starring Kieran Culkin as Matty Banks, B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein, Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie and Jane Adams as Dr. Megan Eisenberg. I can see what the critics mean by giving it two out of five stars in certain places, it certainly isn't as funny as the original film, it concentrates more on the sentimental material, but that's not a bad thing for this comedy drama. Okay! Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. 5/10 \"Father 2\" : Born again.; Okay,now the sequel \"Father Of The Bride 2\",which was surprisingly better than expected. Like anyone who sees a sequel,you expect almost a carbon copy of the first. It does start similar to the first movie,with George sitting in a chair addressing us,the audience. It also does an unfortunate repeat of the fight between Annie &amp; Bryan,again like the first movie,I saw it coming. The baby shower party is not played big,like the first after wedding party but I laughed when actual storks carrying little bundles showed up. I was kind of \"iffy\" on the sub-plot of George selling the house,having to leave in ten days and then blowing a bundle to get it back again. I'm not questioning the probability (we know in reality that'd be impossible),I just found it kind of unnecessary. I did however like his dyed hair and new look,that was hilarious and he should have kept it until the end of the movie. Some may say the idea of a mother &amp; daughter being pregnant at the same time,is impossible. Yet,somehow it works here. It's not just the obvious next step for Annie but for George and his wife too,who thought having babies was way behind them. I love Steve Martin's warped expression when Bryan calls him a \"Grandfather\"! I liked that a woman having a baby in her 40's was taken very seriously,since it's a fact that women who have babies later in life have a more difficult time. It makes for a good piece of drama in a film that's otherwise a family comedy. The comedy is helped once again by the presence of Martin Short and I like that he becomes more involved with the family. Especially helping George out the front door on his back. This after giving him sleeping pills for rest. Once the babies are born and Bryan &amp; Annie head to Boston for a new life,the film gets a very touching ending with George and his new baby girl. 8 out of 10 for the expected repeat of ideas,otherwise a very well made sequel. (END) not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the 1951 movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the 1950 classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the 4 year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com Not bad...but could have been better; The first time I saw Father of the Bride 2 I really liked it.  I still enjoy watching some parts of it but I thought some realistic parts in the movie were not necessary.  First of all, the mother and daughter pregnant together.  This could happen but probably when the mother is not older than 40.  Nina had to be at least 47.  Is it likely that the mother would be pregnant at that age? I don't think so.  Secondly, I could not understand why George and Nina wanted the baby to have two last names.  Children always go by their father's last name and I thought Brian's father made a good observation when he said that George and Nina already had Matt to carry on the Banks name.  So why they thought the baby should have two last names is beyond me.  In conclusion, Father of the Bride 2 is still cute and fun to watch in some parts but I thought the first one was much better Some of Martin's best work!; First, this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2. If run back to back, they run like one beautiful story. This production is great from start to finish. Everything about it is wonderful, including the story, the acting performances and the direction. This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor. His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances. He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man. This movie is no exception. His performance is comedic, yet startlingly genuine. Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's. I love this movie. I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character; with how he feels, and what he's going through. This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum, and I love it. It's less about family, and more about life's curves; the every-day things that make us crazy, happy, sad, and ultimately stronger. It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think, consider, ponder the events which have led us to where we are now. Combined, they rate 8.6/10 from... the Fiend :. Good, so long as you don't try to think too much; It was a fun movie, but it had no particular substance. I mostly watched it because I'd seen the first one. And because it was free on my cable. Or at least, I wasn't paying only to see it. Now, I have done that before and been pleasantly surprised, but this just wasn't one of those movies. Most of what was in this movie has been done already in the first film, and then it was in a much better way. Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, I'm just glad that I got to watch it free. Sure, Steve Martin's always fun to watch, particularly when he's acting dopey for whatever reason, but that didn't make it a great film. Just mediocre. Still, it's fun for a laugh. Average comedy sequel; There's been better, and there's been worse. \"Father of the Bride Part II\" falls right in between when it comes to sequels of comedies. The plot was easily predictable and the movie didn't have as many Steve Martin funny moments as the original. There were some good moments that made me laugh though, most being scenes with Martin Short. It did seem like sort of a stretch, though that all of the sudden \"Frank\" was an interior designer as well as a wedding/baby shower coordinator. I guess they just needed a way to keep him in the movie longer. I was hoping for a lot more when I rented this. My advice: stick to the original. Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! Worthy second installment.; Mild SPOILERS are contained in the following comments. However, I believe everyone knows the story and how it turns out. The fun of the movie is seeing the actors, especially Martin. Steve Martin is back as George Banks, having just lost his daughter and basketball partner (Kimberly Williams as Annie ) to marriage, and now she is back home with her husband and a big announcement. She is pregnant. Of course everyone is happy, and the joy is doubled when Nina Banks (Diane Keaton as Annie's mom) finds out she is pregnant too. Poor George doesn't know if he can handle all this. After all, he is about to be a grandfather, he's not prepared to be a new father also. Martin Short is back as Franck Eggelhoffer, the unintelligible wedding planner. All ends well as both mom and daughter deliver their babies at the same time, in separate hospital rooms, so George has to go back and forth. The movie ends a few months later, and as Annie and her new baby are leaving, she gives dad a miniature basketball, a reminder to George that he can raise another basketball partner. Like Cliches?; ...That weren't even funny the first time? I've seen a lot of films with Steve Martin in them, and they all made me laugh.  Until this one. Part one is worth a look..it may make you laugh a couple of times (I think I laughed once).  But I recommend avoiding this one all together. not bad for a sequel; as sequels go,this is film isn't too bad.i didn't think ti was quite as good as the first one,but it's not a bad effort.i didn't find it as funny,and some of Steve Martin's histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me.really,this one doesn't quite have the same sincerity as the first.through much of this movie,i was all too aware i was watching a movie,whereas with firs tone,i was drawn in,and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting.having said that,there are some bright spots.for,one,this movie is just as touching as the first.and Eugene levy has a great cameo.and there is still some fun to be had.even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above,i still think Father of the Bride II is a 7/10 Not as good as the first, but still great fun.; In the sequel to the brilliant Father Of The Bride, Nina Banks and her daughter Annie are both pregnant and George Banks, being his usual nervous self has to learn to get used to the idea that he's going to be a father again AND a grandfather. The whole cast including, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams and Martin Short are all back here giving good performances. Even though Father Of The Bride Part II is not as good as the first Father Of The Bride, this is still a great movie which is enjoyable and fun all the way through and that's why I'm going to give this good sequel a 10/10.  Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. Good; This is well worth seeing. Everything goes perfectly. Ain't no such thing as too much Steve Martin, baby. Here Martin carries weak material, but it's a positive movie that shows the joy a new child brings. You will laugh, cry and cheer. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Some of the dialog is a bit lost on US audiences, but still some hilarious lines. The music is amazing throughout. Also the scenery is incredible. I saw the cast had a lot of great comedians, so I thought there would at least be a few laughs. Instead, I was surprised to see a very touching movie, absolutely great script. I give it 7 out of 10. What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... A really likable comedy.; I enjoyed this film. I found that it was easy to relate to Steve Martin's character George Banks as a parent. The relationship between him and his daughter Annie, played by Kimberly Williams, was an honest father daughter relationship. I recommend this one for parents in general and empty nesters in particular. The idea of a mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time is plausible and amusing. Fantastic; Both the first movie and this sequel are fantastic. I loved the first movie, so I thought I would give the second one a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised!! The acting from all the characters is amazing, from Steve Martin to Diane Keaton to Kimberly Williams-Paisley. 16 years after its release this movie is still a gem. When I'm feeling down or just need a go-to comedy for a night in, these two movies are the best. For those who say that a 40-something woman is too old to have a baby--that's just not true. Do your research. I bet more people have been in that situation than you think. Anyway, this is a feel-good movie for some great laughs and a few happy tears! I really found this film quite annoying; My basic opinion of this movie is that it is a crappy American feel good comedy. It is simply about a man who is going through another mid-life crisis as his daughter, who was married in the first movie, has a baby in this one. The catch is that his wife is also pregnant and with the irony really dripping, both of them have their babies within minutes of each other. As such the kid's auntie is exactly the same age as him (it won't happen to me, though it is possible). When I watch this movie I think to myself, this guy really doesn't have problems. There are people out there that have much more serious problems than he does. He admits to having a beautiful wife who loves him, owns his own home (or did), has a great job and great kids - and he thinks he has problems. Maybe the whole comedy is in the fact that he is worrying about absolutely nothing, but seriously, when I watch this movie, I simply shake my head and think that the guy is a loser. I really don't think it is all that funny. In fact, the guy has much more serious problems. He seems to be spending an awful lot of money, and is going to find himself in a huge amount of debt, and he doesn't seem to ever be at work. My question is not only where he gets his money, but where he gets the collateral for all of the purchases he is making. He buys back his house for an extra $100,000 on top of what he sold it for, and really, how can he seriously afford it. Okay, it wasn't all that bad. As a movie is was made well, and I did chuckle a few times. But in reality, this guy is a serious loser because he has more than anybody could possibly ask for, and he is worried about growing old. Hell, we all grow old, but he has experience more than what a lot of us have already had. Instead of worrying about growing old, the twit should look back on his life and be thankful for the blessings that God has already given him as opposed to forgetting all of that and winging about his age. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a 10, i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Very Warm and Funny.; This movie is a very warm and funny family film. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the Sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny. The only thing I didn't like was Eugene Levy's character, I found that his part was just put there to extend the movie a bit. I also didn't like how they used him in the second one when he was clearly the one who auditioned to be the wedding singer in the first one. All in all this is a great family film where many will enjoy and watch together. I loved it, but one thing bothered me...; I enjoyed this movie: Diane Keaton is my favourite actress, Steve Martin always makes me laugh and Martin Short is great, but I felt really sorry for Keaton having to pretend to be pregnant. She didn't seem to be enjoying it and when the Banks were at the hospital, she actually looked rather bored, because whenever she spoke from the moment George protested about the doctor's name, she almost made it sound like she was in a maths lesson. Apart from that, it was great! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching Martin, Keaton or Short in a movie or who likes to laugh. 9/10 because of the little problem, but it was great. I loved it. Not exactly the most innovative of films, but still great fun!; This is an excellent, funny, warming film. Although a lot of the \"same kind of thing\" was done in the first movie, it's still entertaining. Steve Martin's character was good, although at times his behaviour is quite pathetic and Martin Short is again entertaining. (Particularly his pronunciation of the word 'pregnant).' Although it's highly predictable and not the most intellectually stimulating of films it is still well worth watching and the vast majority of people would enjoy this film. And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW2, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. As I understand it, there were accusations of anti-Arab stereotyping?; \"Father of the Bride II\" may seem to some people like a lesser Steve Martin movie, with him as the patriarch from the previous movie now having to deal with his daughter's and wife's pregnancies. Unpretentiously silly. But one interesting thing is that apparently, some Arab groups claimed that the movie was making anti-Arab stereotypes, as a Middle Eastern man buys their house with plans to demolish it. I wouldn't have interpreted that as anti-Arab; I mean, it's not like they're portraying him as a terrorist. Oh well, life goes on. The movie's a nice, goofy way to pass time. I really liked the scene where they bring Steve Martin into the hospital (that would've sure been an embarrassment!). Also starring Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, B.D. Wong and Eugene Levy. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the 1951 sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of 50. This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Heartwarming &amp; Hilarious; Steve Martin does it again in this touching and funny sequel to 1991's Father Of The Bride the rest of the cast returns in a new story dealing with the joys of parenthood. I loved Father Of The Bride II not only because it was funny, mostly it was due to the comic antics of a man dealing with two pregnancies at once. He's a great comedian as well as an on screen father, my favorite scene is when both babies arrive at the same time. A year has passed since George Banks (Martin) watched his only daughter Annie (Williams) get married and has accepted her transformation from daughter to wife. She comes home with her husband Brian (Newbern) to announce the wonderful news to her parents, brother Matty (Culkin) and in-laws that she's pregnant. Everyone is thrilled and excited except for George who thinks he's too young to be a grandpa, from then on he tries to act young by dying his hair and exercising. But things are about to get a little crazy when his loving wife Nina (Keaton)discovers she's pregnant too now George must deal with the impending arrival of both his grandchild and his own child. Thrown into the chaos is Franck Eggelhoffer (Short) the wedding coordinator who helps to design a room for the new addition to the Banks family. This movie is not only sweet but it's charming entertainment for fans of all ages. Not bad, but inferior to the first; I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the first movie. It was not without sentiment and it was hardly original, but it was still beautifully filmed, well acted, charming and funny. This sequel is not as good as the first I agree, but I still quite enjoyed it. The story is predictable, and there are some so-so parts in the script. Eugene Levy, who I do like by the way, is okay here but his character felt somewhat unnecessary and felt like he was there as an additional character and to give the film a longer length. And I also would have liked to have seen more of Kimberley Williams, she is so beautiful and quite a good actress, but I actually do agree that a little too much time is spent between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. However, it is beautifully filmed, has a nice soundtrack, decent pacing and good direction. And the acting is fine too, Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are still very likable, and while as I've said I would have liked to have seen more of her Kimberley Williams was lovely. And I loved Martin Short here too, he was one of the main merits of the first film, so to see him in his wonderfully fluffy turn again was a very nice surprise. Overall, not bad at all, could have been better, but I liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Pretty much just a rehash of the first; As this movie started, it reminded me a lot of the first. Various scenes were reenacted, only a little wackier, sort of like it was trying to be a shade more funny than the first; I guess that is the usual stuff for this type of sequels, but I think it failed at that. Apart from that, the movie pretty much succeeds in being a good sequel to the first. The story is also somewhat reminiscent of the first one. All the same actors return as well, and they are pretty much the same, just a shade more wacky. The story is also told by Steve Martins character, George Banks, like in the first. Pretty much everything in the movie is a takeoff of the first; this doesn't make it bad though, if you liked the first, liked the characters, you'll want to see this too, if nothing else, to see the characters again. It is about as funny and as sentimental as the first was, and as enjoyable. Fans of the first one, or of Steve Martin will most likely enjoy at least some part of it, as this is the typical for both the first movie and Steve Martin. 7/10 Father of the Bride Part II; The 1991 Steve Martin comedy proved out to be popular enough to earn a sequel, much like the original Father of the Bride of 1950. All of the main cast of the first film returns in a story where the eponymous father George Banks (Martin) has gotten over the stressful wedding of his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) and her fiancé Bryan (George Newbern). However, when she breaks the big news about her pregnancy to the family, the grandpa-to-be becomes anxious about getting older and starts proving his youthfulness in various ways, such as selling the family's beloved house to a greedy real estate developer Habib (Eugene Levy). Life has more in store for George and his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) though, as it soon turns out that Annie's is not the only pregnancy in the family. Again, the humour is best when it relies on Steve Martin's comical talent and charisma instead of craziness and exaggeration. Unfortunately, adhering to the rule of always making sequels bigger and louder, the writers have given more screen time to the unbelievably annoying wedding planner Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) whose noisy and flamboyant scenes are certainly the weakest parts of the whole movie. The fussy bumbling caused by the impending childbirths at the end is also rather annoying and unimaginative. I think the movie works best during the more subtle scenes, such as Martin making uncomfortable faces while hiding his nervousness or arguing about the baby's surname with the overjoyed family during a dinner. Besides the run-of-the-mill jokes, the movie also shamelessly wallows in impenetrable sentimentalism of the newborns' adorability. Especially the music is so unbelievably schmaltzy that it was really getting on my nerves while watching; can't the filmmakers just trust their material's appeal without burying it under a sweety-tweety sugar mountain? Nevertheless, despite the predictability of the plot and the not-so-hilarious jokes, George Banks is a very likable character and Steve Martin is at home in the role, so those who enjoyed the first movie will probably like this one too  the basic building blocks of the story have not been changed at all. One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. My comments are going to be very positive.; Hi! I think that Father of the Bride Part 2 was a great film and very hilarious. I think that the mother and daughter could have been pregnant at the same time!  It was a great movie and I recommend it to all people who want a warm-your-heart comedy! It's a great film! Thanks! Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. Loved it!!; I thought the sequel to the first Father of the Bride just showed what a great chemistry Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, George Newbern, and Kieran Culkin, along with all the other supporting actors have together. I would actually love to see a Father of the Bride Part III and I usually hate more and more sequels. I really do enjoy this sequel and I think it is better than the first one. I would reccommend any and everyone seeing this movie (but not without seeing the first one). like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $15k bonus to move out in 10 days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $100k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. Good, but first one was better; This film is good but you have to suspend disbelief quite a few times. All the performances are fine, with Steve Martin a scream again, and Diane Keaton glowing from start to finish (she has a lot more to do here than in FOTB1). The best scenes are: George trying to get buff in the gym, asking which famous men he's younger than, pointing to his wedding ring at the lady in the car next to him, and seeing all the misbehaving children out the window in his car while his wife sees all the happy kids and their parents out her window. And of course, when George holds his child and grandchild outside the delivery room. My favorite line: \"Now going to the movies will be economical: one child, two seniors, thanks!\" good, but a mistake; this movie rocks. but there is one thing weird. okay, so in the beginning Annie says, \"i have lived here since i was 5!\" and then later right when they are selling the house and playing basketball Annie and George(her dad) and her dad says \"i remember the first time we played out here, you were 4.\" wait...so was she 4 or 5 when they moved in??????????? other than that this movie makes me laugh, cry(because i laugh so much), and..........uh.....what was that other thing people say when they say that? i don't really remember. i just love how Steve martin always is so cheap. I am forced to say more so i will say i love that this movie is always on HBO! And i realized something, Steve martin has had white hair like forever! Not as good as the first, but good family fun; This movie is as thin as you can get. Its' emotions are easily played. There are no surprises. It is very predictable. And I say...so what? What is wrong with that? This is an American Dream movie. Everything goes perfectly and everyone is as happy as can be. Why should it be a complicated character study? It deals with the birth of babies. There's no complex feelings that need to be dealt with in this situation. A life is being created. A family is being blessed. A baby's birth is a time for love and hope. This movie has both in spades. It's a very positive movie that shows the joy a new baby brings. Every parent-to-be should watch it. A child's birth is an emotional event with no equal. This movie knows it and milks it for all its' worth. My only complaint is it should have been called Parents of the Bride. Way too much time is spent with the relationship between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. There should have been more attention paid to Kimberly Williams. Not only were the scenes between her and Martin the best scenes in this and the original, but Kimberly Williams is the most beautiful actress to come out of Hollywood in many years. Forget all the blond, silicone filled, bimbos that every teenage boy raves about. Ms. Williams is a natural beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late '40's)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now...</td>\n",



Woody is Andy's favourite toy and like all the other toys lives with the fear of being discarded when new toys arrive. He's therefore very worried when Buzz Lightyear arrives. Buzz is an instant hit with Andy and Woody is not very happy. To make matters worse Buzz doesn't think he is a toy and believes he is on a mission. The story really gets going when woody inadvertantly knocks buzz out of the house and the two of them end up with evil Syd who tortures toys. There's lots of adult humour meaning that the parents will find this as funny as the kids. The real winning combination of Toy Story is the characterisation and the empathy you can feel for the animated leads. Although they're not real this is one of the best buddy movies ever made. My personal favourite character is Mr Potato Head because of the dry humour. A classic 10/10 toy story; The original and the best. Woody and the gang have only fun and games until Buzz shows up and steals Woody's thunder. Woody is a pull-string cowboy and the leader of a group of toys belonging to a boy named Andy Davis. With his family moving away one week before his birthday, Andy is given a week-early party to spend with his friends, while the toys stage a reconnaissance mission to discover Andy's new presents. Andy receives a space ranger Buzz Lightyear action figure, whose impressive features see him replacing Woody as Andy's favorite toy. Woody is resentful, especially as Buzz also gets attention from the other toys. However, Buzz believes himself to be a real space ranger on a mission to return to his home planet, as Woody fails to convince him he is a toy. Not one of my favorites; After hearing about the success of the toy story series, a rented a DVD which had a collection of Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc. I loved Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2 but I did not enjoy Toy Story 1 even that much. These were the points that I didn't like in the movie: 1) In the starting, when Andy is shown playing with the toys, he starts to get a bit annoying after he keeps on playing with it. His love for the toys throughout the film bugged me after a while. But I did not find this too boring as even my cousin is a great fan of Spiderman and keeps buying and playing with the toys. 2) The animation looked a bit faded in the movie. But I didn't pay much attention towards it giving an excuse that it was made in 1995 and compared to Finding Nemo and the other new movies, its animation would be a bit duller. 3) Sorry Tom Hanks, but I found your character quite annoying in the film as you kept screaming like a mad character and I did not like you that much. 4) Woody's girlfriend in the movie had a terrible voice. I expected a cute shepherdess's voice to be more cute and sweet rather that being a bit rough and sounding like the second woman in a love story. 5) Mr.Potato head and the other characters, except for the spring dog, really annoyed me when they were reluctant to listen to Woody. I mean, why couldn't they just wait and understand him. 6) The bad boy removed some parts of his toys to make them look terrible. But towards the end, when the toys help Woody and Buzz, Woody thanks them and just leaves. Why didn't he tell the toys to leave that stupid place and run away with them? They should have included these characters in the second film, at least. 7) Toys had lives in the movie. So why did they not just start living alive with the humans? Why do they fall still when their masters came? They could play alive with them. The movie had some good points too. Here are some of them: 1) Tim Allen has done a fantastic voicing as Buzz, and I liked Buzz in the movie as he was shown brave, his voicing was done well and he didn't bore me at all. 2) The dog who supported Woody was cute and I liked him, just, I liked him, in the movie. 3) The movie was different from other movies, as here, toys were shown as the protagonists. 4) The dinosaur was funny and his character uplifted the film. Overall, I don't think it deserves to be in the top 250 movies. But its the people's choice and if they wish that it would be in the top 250, then I can do nothing but give my review on the film. One of the all time greats - but you know that already.; The toys of a small boy have their cosy lives thrown into disarray with the arrival of a new space toy, and the family's imminent move to another home... The first real mainsteam adult-friendly computer animated film. Actually the first real computer-animated film. Toy Story took a cutesy premise and made it believable with a very good storyline, excellent voice acting and amazing design, especially for the time even though this holds up exceptionally well now. More important than this is the longevity of the characters, you can have the prettiest backdrop and brightest colours going but if a kid doesn't like the characters in the thing it isn't going far. Go to a birthday party for any kid under 10 and you'll likely see a Buzz Lightyear or Woody the cowboy. More important this film can be watched and rewatched by anyone from 3 to 43 and there will be something to enjoy, again and again. As a side-note: My videoshop password was Woody for about 5 years thanks to this movie. What you hope kids will learn: Be good to your toys. What they'll take away: Space toys are cool. And Cowboy toys are cool. And Dog toys are cool. And I need one of those Dinosaur toys. Oh, oh, oh and a Mr Potato Head... And a Piggy! And...

In Disney- Pixar's landmark 1995 computer animated feature \"Toy Story\", we get that possible answer as the film is about toys that come to life while the owner is out of their room. In case you don't know why \"Toy Story\" is an important American film and why it's one of only two animated films to make the AFI's list of the 100 greatest films of all time, allow me to fill you in. It was the first full-length computer animated feature ever made and arguably the best in my opinion. \"Toy Story\" was so popular that it was responsible for initiating Pixar's big streak of success with other computer animated features such as \"Up\" (2009), \"WALL-E\" (2008), and \"The Incredibles\" (2004). In \"Toy Story\", a group of toys that belong to a young kid named Andy come to life while he's out of the room. They're all led by Andy's favorite toy, a cowboy doll named Woody (Tom Hanks). They've just learned that Andy and his family will be moving away to another neighborhood. Not only that, but his birthday party is being celebrated earlier than expected, which means new toys will be joining them for sure, much to the horror of the other toys. They're afraid that the new toys will be so cool that Andy will no longer want to play with them anymore. Despite this, Woody assures the other toys that everything will be alright and no one will be forgotten. That is until he discovers Andy's newest toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a space ranger action figure who thinks he's the real space ranger that he's based on. Woody becomes so jealous over how cool a toy he is that he tries to do whatever he can to become Andy's favorite toy again. When one of his attempts at getting noticed by Andy accidentally goes too far (meaning Buzz gets transported out of the house), Woody tries to rescue him and re-earn the trust of his fellow toys. But through a series of circumstances, Woody gets lost right alongside Buzz and they are accidentally found by Andy's next door neighbor, Sid. This is a problem for both of these toys since Sid enjoys torturing and destroying toys. So now Woody and Buzz must get over their differences and work together to get out of Sid's house and back to Andy before he moves. What we have here story wise is your typical buddy comedy in animated form, but it's done right. I'm not saying it just because it's told through a new form of animation, but because the film handles this type of story in an imaginative way. The basic plot seems to play out naturally and comes off as if Pixar was inventing this type of plot for the first time. There are no plot devices that are forced to the point where it's painfully obvious. Everything on screen works within the fabric of the story. The comedic bits, along with being humorous, are very well handled and are necessary contributions to the plot. I loved how in one scene when Woody talks to the toys in Andy's room from Sid's house, the other toys think that Woody murdered Buzz by the end of the scene. That scene and similar scenes were very funny and well done. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are irreplaceable as Woody and Buzz, respectively, since they bring so much to the chemistry and dialogue between each other to the point where it's impossible to top them. They do a great enough job with what they bring into each of their roles that you couldn't picture hearing any other actors play these two characters. The same can also be said for the supporting cast as well, particularly Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn as Rex. The actors do a convincing job at bringing each of their characters to life and putting enough personality into them that they help enhance the story further as good acting should be doing. The way Pixar handles its characters in this movie is also worth noting. For example, even though Sid is having fun destroying toys and is considered evil by the toys, they don't necessarily make him the main villain. In other words, the characters created here aren't exactly clear cut heroes and villains, but they're simply individuals with different personalities. Woody isn't a bad guy because he technically gets Buzz and himself into trouble, he's simply afraid of being forgotten by Andy. That aspect about Woody makes us relate to him even more since we do learn from the mistakes that Woody makes over this misunderstanding. Buzz Lightyear makes for an enjoyable fish-out- of-water type character in that he strongly believes he's the real Buzz Lightyear to the point that being told that he's actually a toy would be nonsense in his mind. Pixar truly cared a great deal about its story and characters here. As you can tell, \"Toy Story\" is more than an innovative American film with its groundbreaking animation or even an entertaining family film. It's a film about characters that I'm sure most of us can relate to or identify with. It's a film for everybody to cherish for different reasons whether it be the animation, the humor, the story or the characters. I'll argue that it's still the finest film Pixar's produced yet. In a pinch, \"Toy Story\" is a film you should definitely check out if you haven't already. one of if not the best animated films ever; Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen. The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer. The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen. The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year) respecting everything around you and never being to greedy or needy. Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come up with. This is a film, that not only can the kids enjoy but also the adults too. Great fun, a film that's not just for kids; I wasn't too sure about this film before I watched it. The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story. The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up  something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space! Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home. Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is 6 years old, but I've only just seen it!). The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others  such as Mr. Potato Head  are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep  who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries! The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back. Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible. The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films  particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations. All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again. And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them? Well, now we know why! A fantastic family film.; The plot:A wooden cowboy doll called Woody is a young boy's favourite toy, yet when his owner gets a space toy of an astronaut called Buzz Lightyear, Woody has been left out of his owner's daily live. Woody finds out that Buzz Lightyear thinks that he really is a space ranger.     Both toys are now fighting each other while being kidnaped by the next door nieghbour that hates toys and must work together to get back to their owner before they are destroyed. The view:A wonderful enchanting and nicely funny story about rivally between two toys that are animated very well, with the fact of the movie being the first that was computer animated, this movie is really for everyone that enjoys watching a film that the whole family will delight in. Great fun. **** I never really thought this was the best movie...; Toy Story is a good movie. It has good characters and a decent story. But is it really worth the hype? Yes, it's the first fully computer animated movie ever made and that's very impressive. For that reason alone, it will stand out in history. But I certainly never really thought it was the brilliant classic everyone else thought it was. Its animation is great but the story suffers from major pacing issues. There are entire moments of the movie right in the middle that bore me every time and don't stop boring me until I get to the film's climax, when it picks up again. A lot of trimming should have been done in the middle. Toy Story is good but its sequels are a lot better. So is it bad? No. But it's not brilliant. If this were 2-D, I doubt it would receive this high praise. One of the greatest animated movies ever created!; I don't want to be biast, but Toy Story is one of the greatest animated movies ever created. I first watched this movie at about 2-4 years old, and I loved this movie. The storyline is excellently written, and always gets me laughing! The animation in this movie is incredible! As a computer animated film it was well ahead of its era (at least I think). Also, it was the first feature length film that was fully animated, and to this day is one of the best. With the success of this film it was no wonder they made a sequel, one that i enjoyed a lot! Also, I have heard that Pixar have announced Toy Story 3, and it will be a movie I will definitely see! They Don't Call it \"Playing\" for Nothing.; The opening scene says it all. Film-making begins in early childhood, as children use their toys to create little scenes (or movies if you will). The word \"play\" when used to describe such activity indeed derived from the movies of another era, plays. Or perhaps the other way around. Either way, the point of this film is to show that creating a film and playing with toys are virtually the same thing. So the film is basically about itself. A play about playing. This is exactly the type of multi-layered construction that I believe subconsciously challenges and nurtures our kids' minds. Teaching a child (or adult!) to think on more than one level at a time is simply a gift. It should also be applauded that it's all substance and no fluff. Other animation teams have inundated their films with meaningless pop culture gags, camp, and nostalgic irony. Not to mention an abundance of toilet humor. Music by the great Randy Newman instead of the Village People. None of the mindless pandering to adults here, either, yet we are included in the fun by being subtly reminded of our own play days. Barrel of Monkeys. Potato Heads. In fact there is a strong undercurrent theme here as the classic cowboy toy is threatened by the flashy new space man who is obviously being pushed on kids via a relentless marketing campaign. We 30-somethings must root for Woody. It's Wal-mart vs. our favorite mom-n-pop corner store. These Pixar guys are brilliant, and I believe they will be revered someday as perhaps the most important influence in all of filmdom during the turn of this century's period. There is no more sure thing than a Pixar offering. Always compelling, engaging, intelligent and abstract. And this one is the best. Perfect film; Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only concern is easy when you can replace the new birthday and Christmas toys already there. Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, such a birthday, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new toy buzz lightyear. Competition buzz on the edge of the bed to hide, but accidentally pushes him out the window boil runs Woody, and Woody and buzz find a few other expulsion leaves them with no choice but to return her home. But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence. Typically, animation, Intelligence, humor and children's humor, the same mixture (Ice Age, monsters Inc, Bugs life, toy story is being used since it's easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out given how. I just watched it again and new twists on the formula than a little comes out. Each one is clearer and there seems to be more references in the background etc. However, it is still very funny and deserve credit for being the first of a successful formula. The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement. To the shores really what the main story is fun, but in terms of character development. When confronted with the truth of his status as a toy and nothing more against him, the conflict between buzz and Woody cartoon character, this is taken deeper,,, buzz the turmoil is very real. Two powerful support customers, despite the players a real depth. In fact, more rows, but may not have the funniest lines. 'Adult' Intelligence most of the potato head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky Dog. Funny and very used. In fact, the majority of the humor will go over kids heads, and the plot on the right. Looking back, this movie really must have helped sales so much in the movie toy companies on a sarcastic edge I feel. The marketing department behind this film it's not that hard to see standing rubbing his hands. However, the actual product quickly I forgot about this great fun. The voice work is excellent and the characters the players match. Allen woody and buzz for the B-type as he has a voice Hanks movie is good. His usual Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (), reckless, and all other support roles for adults turns out to be really good and probably the favorite characters. In general, this (if not more) as a classic film that will appeal to children as adults. A good plot and a very sharp short command already make time fly by. The only downside to want to go out and buy the damn things children! Best Disney ever; Finally a Disney movie which isn't moralistic but just fun to watch. Also it doesn't have the boring \"sing-along-songs\" so this movie is also a perfect movie for anybody about 10 years and (much) older. I really liked the computer-generated graphics because the characters moved very smoothly, something which can't be done the original way. More of these masterpieces in the future please and I will really like Disney at last, but dont't make it to moralistic and musical. That this movie is above all the other Disney -movies in the IMDB top 250 is proof of that. A wonderful family movie!; What a wonderful movie for the whole family to enjoy!  I can hardly wait for Toy Story 2 to come out! Great As The Other One!; This Toy Story is as great as the second one! I saw the second one first and it was really cool! Best Pixar movie to date!; Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (\"I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout\"). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox. If it wasn't for Toy Story coming together so well, computer animation would have taken a step backwards.; 9.4 For years, Disney reigned as the superior animation studio. Although there were others creating animated feature length films, Disney has always been a household name, known for their experience and ability to create an emotional and entertaining experience out of hand-drawn images, and original, composed music. In 1995, Pixar Animation Studios released Toy Story. While it wasn't the first time that we've seen CGI, or Computer Generated Imagery, it was the first fully CGI film. What a disaster this film could have been. And thank God that it wasn't. If it was, then it would have done more damage to CGI animation than otherwise. The film was distributed by Disney, but created by Pixar. It had no musicals. No frames were hand drawn, everything was done by computer. It had a lot to live up to. Sticking the Disney name on the film meant that audiences expected not a single drop of mediocrity out of it. Thankfully, as we all know, Toy Story was a success. The animation in the film isn't the augmented reality kind. CGI effects aren't added to real life shots, everything is animated. This gives the film some room to breathe. The lighting, surfaces and other effects all look good, in their own context. It would have been a huge step backwards for computer animation if Toy Story didn't come together so well, and successfully put up that fourth wall. But besides the animation, what brings to film to life is the voice- acting, story, and presentation. It's a story about toys who are conscious and self-aware. However, they all follow a strict code, where they do not allow humans to know of their life and intelligence. It's not an epic tale. Two toys are lost and have to get back home. But what carries the film are the characters. Every toy has a distinct personality, and the voice actors are great in their roles. This is one of the strong points in Toy Story. The film's presentation is great, too. It went totally contradictory of what Disney means to people. There are no musicals, but the music, although used sparingly, has a great effect nonetheless. The direction is of the more typical Hollywood style, and different from the typical Disney movie. It is entertaining to exist in the toys' world, and when they venture off a couple of blocks, you feel like you have traveled a long distance. Toy Story could have been such a disaster. If it wasn't for everything coming together so well, especially the animation, characters and voice acting, computer animation would have taken a step backwards. Its greatest strength are the toys. They are amongst the better characters in film. Toy Story not only proved that animated films can be done in a different formula than the already great Disney one, but that computer animation was here to stay. It was a pleasure to the eyes, and a pleasure to the Andy inside all of us. The cartoon that started it all.; I am not a kid but a kid at heart. Toy Story is one of the best animated movies around. This is the most creative movie for kids and adults. Toy Story 2 is better story than the first one, but equally imaginative in computer graphics. Tears....; Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library. The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in 1937 lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Awesome; A very sweet and fun movie. TOY STORY has great computer animation. A simple yet well told story is also added as well. The voice overs are top notch and everyone gets a fair share in this movie. PIXAR has done a good job placing itself on the map. Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle. Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel. A good rent. Classic Animation!!; Toy Story was the first fully animated movie that released in 1995. Starring Tom Hanks as Woody who brings life to the cowboy pull- string doll. Buzz Lightyear, played by Tim Allen brought the right attitude for the newest addition to Andy's (John Morris) toy collection. The story takes us back to the day where we played with toys and used our imaginations to create our own stories. When Andy would leave the room the toys would come to life. A week before Andy's birthday, with his family moving, he is given a party to spend with friends before they leave. The toys plot a way to discover Andy's new presents. After the party the other toys discovered Buzz is one of the presents Andy's receives before he leaves. The main theme of the story to me is \"friendship.\" It's a great story relaying the message to be kind to everyone because you never really know when you might need them and your enemy could be your best friend in the end. After all, \"You've got a friend in me.\" Woody doesn't want to lose top spot as favorite toy so he plots to get rid of Buzz. He starts with a master plan that leaves the both of them in a situation to help each other to get home. The rich colors and 3D animation gives the movie a more realistic feeling as if it were drawn. It is the lighting, modeling, computer graphics and animations are what bring this movie to life. The shading of certain objects, cracks or spills could be the difference between a human look or manufactured. The lighting had to be hard to create the film. They had some dramatic moody lights in Sid's room, flashlight stuff, daylight, bright sun for all sorts of different kinds of environments. When they add light it gives more a visual interest for viewers and hide some flaw in animation. Andy's room gives a sense of a happy, friendly and safe place because the brightness in the room gives that affect. This is an overall great film introducing a new way of animations! A Toy in the making of another and more toys; Excellent voice match to character in movie. Could have more art and less same images repeat. Pixar is now faster than ever; 1995 a slower speed for animated film. Will watch again, but not over and over again, consecutively. Liked it on Facebook, happy go lucky and not afraid to be bold. Don't understand the likes and dislikes but willing to accept all criticism. My own personal review may be liked or may be disliked. The clearness and accurate manner for beautiful taste in dual role models for example Sid the evil kid whom abuses toys and Andy the kid who doesn't like to play rough. However, Sid's sister is quite an opposite to Sid as well; she being a girl and has a love for tea parties with her closest doll Friends. The jokes and laughter in \"Toy Story\" is what made this turn of a century animated film a door-buster into the the first \"digital\" animated films in history. Of course, one does grow old and the story is great passed on to your children in just about any house hold! Toy Story; The story is about toys. The boy who named Andy has toys and enjoys playing with them. To be surprised, their toys can talk and act freely. Nobody of human know the fact. Woody who is Andy's cowboy toy spends a good time, however, Andy's new toy appear for Woddy. The toy's name is Buzz Lightyear. Woody and Buzz fight all the time and loses sight of their family and toys. They tries a lot of ways to meet their family and toys. The film is a long film by Pixar Animation Studious. The genre of the movie is animation, comedy and fantasy. It has dialogue and colors. It has sound effect and it is good to use the way of music. I like the scene that Woody and Buzz success in getting into a car that Andy rides. The film can be enjoyed by only children but also adults. You've got a friend in me; \"Reach for the sky\"! The opening statement of Woody (Hanks) a toy cowboy during a boys playtime. A statement that proves to be ironic when he later looks up at a toy from space, Buzz Lightyear (Allen). Woody's owner is growing older and Woody struggles to accept the change as Buzz becomes Andy's new favourite toy. Leading from the once strong leader into a bout of jealousy and even malice as he tries to take Buzz out of the picture. Woody is then separated from Andy via a fight with Buzz and has to find a way home. Further change occurs as Woody is forced to align with Buzz to escape the toy antagonist Sid. It takes 3/4 of the movie for Woody to finally change his ways, and work with Buzz for the final great escape. Woody's journey from leader to outcast to redemption is intriguing to watch unfold. His final monologue with Sid was beautifully written as the toy out wits the boy. The whole irony of his story is that a child's mind is fleeting and 10 minutes of playing with Buzz and Woody would have been in the game again. For me it is Buzz that follows the greater path of change. Noble and confident throughout mostly due to being under the illusion he is an actual space ranger. Kudos to the writer who decided to take a toy from this world and make him believe he is real! Simple but incredibly compelling. Buzz's final realisation that he is a toy is arm breaking for him but heartbreaking for us. For a family movie Buzz's breakdown is surprising and well delivered and the journey back to being he hero has Buzz literally \"Reaching for the sky\". With us the viewers figuratively as we are up there with them cheering the final events. Woody and Buzz's journey home is supported by a cast of toys, each with a filled out personality. Loyal Slinky being one of my favourites, always reluctant to turn on his buddy Woody like the others. It's the direction of John Lasseter that puts us into this world. When Woody shouts \"You are a toy\". It's John speaking to us. From the beginning the camera is at ground level. We are not supposed to be a child watching his toys come to life but an actual toy, low level shots panning up throughout give a feel to the vastness of a toys world. We are right there through each playtime, adventure, triumph and failure and by the end Buzz may be flying but we are falling for these toys, in style. The story and characters are a success but the triumph is the medium in which the story is told. Through 3d animation, never before seen feature length. The Pixar animators made a bedroom and a pizza planet truly realistic. They brought toys to life in movement and texture. But most astonishing of all, they made us care for a bunch of 3d shapes put together through countless hours of rendering in a computer. The result is a metaphor for change, not just in the story itself and it's characters but in the medium it is told. The great change from 2d to 3d animation which is now common place for feature animation. This movie is a game changer for cinema and animation alike. Walt Disney and co did it in 1938. 54 years later John Lasseter and co did it again. The possibilities for 3d animation in film are Infinite, and Beyond...? this movie is awesome!the humor never bores!; i remember when this movie came out in 1995. i was seven at the time. i have loved it since day 1. actors such as tom hanks and tim allen bring sparkle to the show. they are both hillarious as woody and buzz. this movie is directed at both kids and adults. the humor never goes flat and it is never cheesy or corny. if you are a fan of tom hanks and tim allen or you just want a good laugh, than you shoud definitely watch this movie. you will not regret it. ********** out of **********. In my top 25; Although i like to think the 3rd is the best, everyone should respect this film, the first feature film to be animated, and still holds up as one of the best! And not to mention being in the top 250, thats a accomplishment! this film will forever stay with me as a Nostalgic relic, i only hope that newer generations will remember this film as i do. I still like to think of this as my favorite film of all time, if anyone was to ask me, usually because i can't think of one i'd rather be proud of saying i love it so much, or maybe i'm a total hipster? This film for me is a 8/10, not as perfect as the 3rd, but good enough for any Pixar fan. An Entertaining Accomplishment; This movie is one of the real achievements of the modern age, and a real measure of how good is the fact that you quickly forget your amazement at the computer animation and just get the story. We signed up to buy it the first day they had pre-orders and have enjoyed it since - and we didn't have kids then! A rare combination of many things that can be enjoyed by everyone.  I can't believe anyone would rate it less than a 9! A MUST HAVE! It's a Happy Movie! Ya there's spoilers; I put this computer animated movie just on the cusp of being great. You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time...8.7/10 This DVD is part of the Toy Story 2 Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages. Quality animation always looks good on the big screen and this looks wonderful. This is a Buy and Hold to flesh out your collection to include 'Happy Movies' as my daughter puts it. The DVD is a solid 9/10 Toy Story; A wonderfully sculpted piece of filmmaking. It brings us into a new age and may this new age have films that are just as delightfully witty as this pleasing film for all ages. The laughs are constant, there's great creativity at work, from the artists and the numerous talents who lend their voices. Hanks, Allen, Rickles and Ermey stand out in their performances. An unmissable film; From our first sight of Woody until his happy face disappears off of the screen the makers of this film keep audiences worldwide glued to the screen with eager anticipation. The films unlikely scenario where talking toys battle to save a fellow toys life is amazingly gripping and a \"must see\" which will keep the whole family (yes even the teenageers) amused. The more mature audience will recognise the \"spoofy\"side to the movie. This is most noticeable when plastic soldiers (who mimic the actors in \"Who saves wins\") jump off  bannisters with miniature parachutes and talk to each through baby monitering systems.!!! In conclusion, TOY STORY is one of the most thought out films in the industry as props and scenerycan not just be found lying around and everything had to be individually designed, crafted and computerised The Best Animated Movie of All Time; 1995's Toy Story is a work of pure imagination. It covers topics of fantasy, friendship and jealousy. It also contains relatable characters which shines out compared to other animated films. The actors were perfectly cast (Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz - the list goes on...) and the intricate plot can be compared to some of the best movies ever. I think everyone in the world has seen Toy Story, but if you haven't, it's a must see. Its by far superior to its two sequels, but they are decent. Not only is it a great film, it is historically significant, as it was the first fully 3D animated film. You HAVE TO SEE THIS... J My favorite film as a kid and remains a classic today; As a kid, I remember watching the first two Toy Story films frequently and collecting all the characters from the movie. I found out that it was the very first computer-animated film about two years ago and assumed that's why the movie is still so popular. Woody and Buzz are what made the film what it was then and today and were my favorite characters. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is where Woody and Buzz are launched in the air from the rocket and Buzz frees himself to fly into Andy's toy box. The film remains a classic and always will be to me. I also cannot wait for the third movie to come out June 18, 2010 because I'll be the first in line. A resounding success; Pixar knocks it out of the park with its first feature film, about friendship, jealousy and the capriciousness of privileged white kids in a society of disposability. A clever, sharp and imaginative screenplay expertly voiced by a stellar cast (I would give this 5/10 just for casting Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head) keeps the swiftly moving story engaging throughout, flagging only a bit when self- deluded toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is briefly depressed. The film hops from one great set-piece to the next with head-spinning speed that leaves me marveling at how simple director John Lasseter and the team of animators make it look to bring these toys to life with just a few touches of individuality. Every viewer will probably have their favorite parts. Back when I first saw the movie upon its initial release, mine was the new-age toys who worship the Claw; upon recent viewing, I think it is \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" rendition of evil neighbor Sid's bedroom. It's hard to remember now that Pixar has proved so successful that there was real doubt about whether its style of computer-graphics animation would be embraced by audiences -- kudos to Pixar for proving the doubters wrong. Very good!; As much as I enjoyed this film, I think the sequel was even better. One can certainly relate to Woody's jealousy of Buzz, and cheer when they've found the perfect best friend. I loved it when all the toys put evil Sid in his place, and I'm even happier that Sid wasn't in the sequel! Best of all is that Woody and Buzz never give up. Great animation and voice-overs! Exciting; Toy story is a 1995 American computer-animated adventure buddy comedy film produced by Pixar Animetion Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures, directed by John Lasseter at his directorial debut. Toy story was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first theatrical film produced by Pixar. In the film, toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present. A group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy, are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother and his sister are preparing to move the following week. The toy's leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Woody organized the other toys. Andy gets an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear as a birthday present. He believes that he is an actual space ranger. What happen to Andy's toys next? The characters have individuality. The picture on the screen is colorful, so I think the film is very cute. I am excited because I think about what happen next and what Andy's toy do next. I love the film's view of the world. Everyone enjoys the film, regardless of age or sex. I want you to watch the film. The one that started it all; In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In 1995, they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be 100% made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history. The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having \"souls\" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was. Rating: 9,5/10 The Beginning of a Classic Trilogy.; Toy Story came out on 1995 and it got 2 more sequels Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3. Story: Woody, a traditional pull-string talking cowboy, has long enjoyed a place of honor as the favorite among six-year-old Andy's menagerie of toys. Quick to calm their anxieties about being replaced by newer arrivals, Woody finds his own confidence shaken, and his status as top toy in jeopardy, upon the arrival of Buzz Lightyear, simply the coolest space action figure ever made. Woody plots to get rid of Buzz, but things backfire and he finds himself lost in the outside world with Buzz as his only companion. Joining forces to find their way home, the two rivals set out on an adventure that lands them in the clutches of Sid, a sadistic neighborhood kid who is notorious for dismembering and reassembling \"mutant\" toys in his bedroom. As \"guests\" of Sid and his dog, Scud, the two fugitive toys forge a genuine friendship and learn that only through mutual trust and respect do they have any chance of survival. Toy Story is one of the best animation movies ever made full of laughs and drama with a great cast voicing the stars and a great script and direction it's easy to say that Toy Story is still one of the best movies ever made and for sure a Classic. An amazing family film; Toy Story is a timeless classic. Probably the most genuine, innocent, simplistic yet powerful attempt to create a children film which appeals both adults and kids alike. It is the story of how two rival 'living' toys - a old western cowboy toy (Woody) and action figure of a space commander (Buzz Lightyear) become best friends under some dangerous circumstances. There are bunch of numerals toys like Mr. Potato, a Barbie, a magnifying toy, a truck, alien toys and many more. The film is crafted so well that within some few minutes of the film, you are intrigued to it. It is a fascinating film, with amazing characterization. The toys are so believable that you feel close to them. You feel cherished when Allan and his company make a spoiled brat kid Sid (who loves blowing up toys) realize how important is to save toys which bring back the memories of childhood. I must say the script is effortless and very well written. Music by Randy Newman is also great. One striking thing in this film are its sound effects and CGI which are considered ground-breaking for a 1995 film. Overall, the film is highly recommended. Not only for children, but for everyone who love cherishing the childhood memories - the lovely Toys. Toy Story and the Imagination; The film Toy Story is an animation film that changed the movie game with its technological advances used to create this bold, colorful computerized animation. Toy Story is about a boy named Andy and his love for his toys. Andy's favorite toys have a huge secret that he is not aware of, they are actually alive and become real when no one is around. Andy has a favorite toy cowboy named Woody who is the Sheriff and leader of all the other toys. Woody pride himself on being Andy's favorite toy, but that title is challenged when Andy has a birthday party and receives a new space ranger toy Buzz Light Year. In the scene that introduces Buzz Light Year, it is kind of symbolic that the new toy may be a replacement for the old cowboy Woody. As the kids rush in the room the day of Andy's birthday party Woody is thrown under the bed, and Buzz Light Year is placed on the bed in Woody's spot. Time goes by as Randy Newman's song \"You got a friend in me\" plays as the soundtrack during various scenes as Andy becomes more involved with Buzz, eventually pushing Woody to the background. The lyrics to the song could be considered an ironic montage to the mood that Woody feels during these scenes, because he is lonely and feels replaced. Buzz on the other hand is indulging in the admiration that he receives from Andy. The soundtrack to this movie as awesome, because the lyrics of the songs played like, \"you got a friend in me\", \"strange things\", and \"pop goes the weasel\". Those songs can replace the dialogue in the scenes and the audience will still be able to follow on. At Pizza Planet there is some tension between the two toys Buzz and Woody, which causes them to end up with the neighbor kid Sid, who is known to destroy his toys. Once the movie reaches this climax the characters positions change. Woody and Buzz are forced to reconcile and work together in the quest to return home. The special effects and graphics used in this animation were phenomenal. The camera angles, digital character movements, even facial expressions, helped bring the toys in the film to life. Although this film theme was surrounded by the dynamic relationship between alpha toys Woody and Buzz Light Year. The supporting characters, the relationships displayed between Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, the comedic scenes with Rex the Dinosaur and Slinky the Dog made the film more entertaining and realistic. Toy Story is a must see film for all children who has a love for toys. Watching this film will enhance a new found respect for the creativity of children's imagination. Great film about toys; Toy Story is the first fully computer-animated film. It tells the story of a cowboy toy named Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) who is jealous when a new toy arrives, Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen). Buzz thinks he's a space ranger, and is eventually \"disposed of\" accidentally by Woody. (Woody had only meant to knock Buzz behind a dresser) Woody and Buzz eventually become friends, and had it not been for that friendship, Buzz would have been . . well, I'll let you see it yourself. Toy Story, while a great film, is the only Pixar to not be among my Top 10. But still, I think it's worth watching. It may not be log enough, but not all good movies have to be 2-3 hours long. My Score: 9/10 One or two?; I have no idea which is the best, as depending on my mood either one suits me. This for my money is best for its darker aspects, Sid, Buzz and Woody's rivalry etc.       This film is not only groundbreaking with effects, but raised the bar with its smart script and proper characters. Deserves all the praise. Animation's \"Citizen Kane\"; A technological breakthrough (the first entirely digital animated feature), John Lasseter's comedy would be astonishing if only for the realism of the film's design. But Lasseter and his writers (there are six others who get credit) have fashioned a screenplay simple in story line but complex in structure and emotion; it's also rollickingly funny with a spate of memorable lines that have real depth to them. As two beloved toys vying for their owner's affection, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are splendid--they join forces with Lasseter's formidable crew to make their characters come completely alive. You feel as if you know them thoroughly by the conclusion and are moved by the life lessons they've learned, lessons you would want any child to learn. In addition to the main performers, the voice cast is perfectly suited to the toys they're called upon to represent: there's Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, the late Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex, the timid dinosaur, Annie Potts as Bo Peep and John Ratzenberger as Hamm, the talking pig. Laurie Metcalf is the voice of the child's mother. A supreme accomplishment, you can watch it over and over again and still find something new every time--it's animation's \"Citizen Kane\". The one that started it all with Pixar; In 1995 a man named John Lasseter set up his own company called Pixar which was also owned by the late Steve Jobs. So their first film was of course Toy Story. Everyone has seen this movie before its probably the best Pixar movie to date since the mid 1990s. The story is about Woody the cowboy(voiced by Tom Hanks)who is a toy along with many other toys that come to life when no one is in the room. All of the toys are owned by Andy a young boy who lives with his mom and his sister. So on the eve of Andy's birthday he ends up getting a new toy,the Buzz Lightyear toy which is a very popular toy who is a space ranger. So when Woody is introduced to Buzz Lightyear(voiced by Tim Allen)Woody ends up being jealous of him and he would do anything to be the center of attention again. But when a rough kid who lives next door accidentally gets Woody and Buzz out of a cash rending machine its up to Woody and Buzz to escape Sid's house. Overall this was a very original authentic masterpiece. The story is very good,the music is great,the charcthers are engaging and the whole set up is fantastic. Its a shame it didn't win an Oscar but at least the 2010 prequel to it won Best Animated Feature beating the likes of Tangled and How To Train Your Dragon. 9/10 Best Toy Story Movie; This movie is funny, hilarious, humorous1 It makes the whole wide world wanna laugh! This movie is so funny, you'd laugh your butt off! I liked it how Sid scared his sister but messing up her toys. I wish I can do what he does to the Animal Crossing players! They make me sick because they suck more than Justin Bieber. Also, it's funny how Woody murdered Buzz! Also Bo Peep reminds me of Princess Peach from the Super Mario series. She should have appeared in the other Toy Story movies. I can't believe they screwed up on Toy Story 3, one of the worst Toy Story movies ever! I hope they don't ever screw up Toy Story 4, which comes out next year. Amazing; This movie has something for everyone in the family. It is funny, has action, has a life story, and the characters will touch your heart. These are not just toys, this is a friendship, siblings, relationship or just a way of thinking sometimes. It is a real story on so many levels. It is a heart-warming story about a child and his toys and the relationships between the toys. In Toy Story, the two main characters are Buzz and Woody. At first Buzz and Woody can not stand each other and the two of them fight for the love of their owner Andy. Throughout the story these two show that fighting, arguing, and not getting along will get you no where in life and finally come together to help each other get back to their owner so that they can get back to their home. After all the trials and tribunals these two go through they become the best of friends and go on for two more movies to be a heroic team. Great Movie; All kids should watch this movie. It is very Funny. All the characters remind me of how good times growing up. The animation was before its time. All the toys are very courageous and dominating. Most animation movies could not keep my attention around this time, but this movie most definitely kept my eyes glued to the screen and my bottom in my theater chair. Approving each other; I watched this movie when I was an elementary student for the first time. That time, I only thought that toys are cute, or something like that. However, this film contains moral meaning, and I have not realize it until I become an adult. This film tells us the importance of things. These days, people have many things. It means we are rich. However, it's only the abundance of objective things. In toy story, a boy with many toys but does not have heart to treat toys dearly is suppose to be punished. This suggests the situation of modern society, and reminds us the importance to treat things carefully. Another point that I like in this film is, the growth of the cowboy. When he meets Buzz for the first time, he did not accept Buzz, because he couldn't understand everything about Buzz. Moreover, his position was taken over because of Buzz's appearance. However, he learns the importance of understanding other people, through the adventure to return to home. Also, Buzz finally comes to understand Woody. This means that we can understand each other even if the existence is in contrast. Good and groundbreaking; Good and groundbreaking computer animation graphics movie that delivers but does not reach a higher level due to the animation itself not having the \"warmth\" of the drawing style classic Disney animations.Still,the computer style here is very promising and quite impressive.Good story and script.A good solid start in a new trend in animation production.Very good voice acting.Only for fans of kids movies..... The Largest Part Of My Childhood Put On Screen.; With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. \"Toy Story\" was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises & confidence. How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history. I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling & technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals & entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks & Tim Allen, and almost immediately think \"Toy Story\". As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then. Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, \"Toy Story\" is that proof. 10/10. Toy Story was like the Snow White of 1995; I remember going and seeing Toy Story when I was 5 years old at the movies. I fell completely in love with it! It had great animation, great characters and a great story! My favorite character was the Slinky Dog played by my favorite comedian the late Jim Varney (God rest his soul). I loved it towards the end when Slinky is trying to get Woody and Buzz into the moving van and the others toys in the moving van pull on him so hard that he begins to stretch out! That was hilarious! I also liked it when Slinky says Come on PotatoHead! If Woody says it's all right well darn it it's good enough for me! Woody has never stared us wrong before! With Toy Story PIXAR showed us what Computer Animation could do to tell a great story! Toy Story like Snow White it an animated classic that'll go on forever! I'm hoping one day to get a job at PIXAR and I think Walt Disney would of been proud of what they've done with Toy Story and Computer Animation. God bless you Pixar Animation Studios! Great fun for anyone; Toy Story is definitely a film that a kid should watch before they are a teen. Its adventure and great sense of humour is appealing to adult audiences as well, and the atmosphere is brilliant. This really is a Toy Story. The plot is indeed quite simple, and it would have to be for a classic family. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks)is a toy 'sheriff' doll, owned by a young boy called Andy. Woodys Toy life couldn't as Andy loves him a lot, but as Andy's birthday party arises tension fills the bedroom with each toy living in fear of being replaced. Everything goes well till the last birthday present is opened.. enter Buzz Lightyear! I would be criminal to tell you the rest of the story, but as far as humour and adventure are concerned, this film impresses in both categories. The toys different personalities really contrast and make you laugh, from the smart-chat of Mr. Potatoe head, to Slinky who is Woodys best toy friend. Its so easy to follow this film - the plot and characters are easy to watch the computer graphics are top notch. Compared to modern day CGI kids films, this stands out purely because of its innocence - a simple story, theirs no techno-babble, and its really fun. This truly is the film of the Nineties! Toy Story; This was the very first computer animated film from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation, it is just excellent. It is showing what happens when the young Andy leaves his room, his toys come to life! Woody the cowboy is Andy's favourite toy, and looks after all the other toys (and he is a very good Tom Hanks voicing). Unfortunately on Andy's early birthday party he gets a new favourite toy, Buzz Lightyear the space ranger (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody obviously gets jealous and both him and Buzz end up lost, and then in evil Sid's room. For a kid, Sid is a good villain. Woody and Buzz are now trying to find a way to get back to their owner. Also starring Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Jim Varney as Slinky, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Morris as Andy, Scream 2's Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom, Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Army Sarge and Jeff Pidgeon as Green Aliens.With recognisable toys for every generation, and the Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song \"You've Got a Friend\" and Oscar nominated music by Randy Newman, this is a great family film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and a Special Achievement Award (fior creation of a feature-length computer-animated film), it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, along with the sequel, both was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons, and it was number 40 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding! Great start to a great trilogy; The beginning of a sensational trilogy , I think this is the weakest of the trilogy , more does not mean it is bad , quite the contrary , it's great movie, who would say that dolls speakers would so sure , the history of this is great , it's funny , the double Woody and Buzz is very good at the beginning Woody has envy him to be best friends, Sid movie villain is cruel , you feel a giant hatred for him , we have other characters , the soundtrack is excellent, the voice work is amazing , the brilliant Tom Hanks who is the voice of Woody , Woody scene trying to escape from Sid's house is very good and fun (remember some prison movies) , Toy Story is a classic animation, and deserves to be seen by all. Note 8.8 Lost a vote cuz it was too short!!; I want to get the recently re-released anniversary edition because this is a must have for any collection, be it animation or just good movies! What an absolutely funny, original and mesmerizing movie! I mean, come on, what kid in the history of the world doesn't, at some time, think their toys are alive. That's why girls talk to Barbie or have tea parties with all the toys, and guys chat with GI Joe and make believe the hot wheels can talk! Let's not even bring up our puppets! Pixar and Disney not only knock our socks off with the most amazing computer generated animation, but the writers of this story hit a home-run and totally captured the whimsical innocence of what we all knew was going on when we were kids; that our toys are alive and only want to be played with and cherished. In addition, the superb voice acting by a cast of actors that obviously still remember being a kid, only gives this instant classic the status of being the \"Gold Standard\" to which all others in this category will have to be judged. My only complaint and why I only give 9 out of 10, is that it is far, far too short, running 1 hour and 20 minutes! I know I'm selfish, but I want MORE!! I could and would have watched 2 or 3 hours of this! But that's why there's a Toy Story 2!! Wonderful animated feature...; TOY STORY is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. It goes along with TOY STORY 2, TARZAN, A BUG'S LIFE, THE LION KING and CHICKEN RUN as some of my favorite animated features. Tom Hank s voices Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll owned by a boy named Andy who is the most-played toy until a space ranger, Buzz (Tim Allen) comes along and Woody is not good friends with them. But one day later, a mean toy-hating man who owns a collection of mutant toys and tries to threaten Buzz, and it is up to Woody to save Buzz with the help of the mutants before it's too late to escape to Andy's new house. The sequel is better than the original, but TOY STORY is a good movie. **** An Instant Classic!; After a few short films and no major recognition-in 1991, Pixar set out to start the ball rolling for computer-animated entertainment and in 1995 unleashed not just a mere film but a work of art. An instant classic when first released...Toy Story went on to earn nearly $400 million worldwide and capture the hearts of children and adults alike with its unforgettable characters, magical musical score, hilarious script and the classic quote \"To infinity and beyond\". Woody (Tom Hanks) is an old-fashioned pull - string cowboy doll living a life of luxury as the favourite toy of a young boy named Andy. Surrounded by a colourful cast of characters - such as the cynical Mr. Potato Head, the wisecracking Piggy bank Hamm and Woody's brown-nosing second-in-command Slinky Dog - Woody seems something of a king. However, when a new toy arrives on the scene-a high tech spaceman action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Woody suddenly loses his popularity. But this toy comes with a surreal extra feature - he thinks he's the real Buzz Lightyear!! In the effort of removing Buzz as Andy's favourite toy-both toys are swept out of their home, and into the outside world where they unite reluctantly in friendship for an adventure home. Toy Story; This movie came out around the time I was born. And I especially remember watching this and Toy Story 2 (the sequel) like every day. And I remember getting sucked in to a world I'd like to live in. A world were my toys came to life. In my mind, this movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250 list. This is a movie everyone can enjoy. This is definitely Disney Pixar's best movie. Although Monster's Inc., The Incredibles, Cars, Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, and Meet the Robinsons are great. It does not come close to the magic Toy Story brings. If you have not yet seen Toy Story, where the hell have you been? It's a fantastic movie, and my favorite. So if you haven't seen it yet...Then what are you waiting for....GO!! yup; The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy). The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing. I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had. Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made  something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.' Not only for children under 10 !; I saw this really cool animated movie and I really liked it. Buzz LIGHTYEAR and WOODY didn´t get along much in that movie, but together they mastered their way out of danger. I am really looking forward seeing part two of this film. Really good animation, with almost real looking sequences, the scene with the rocket and the remote-control buggy, when BUZZ and WOODY chasing the van is really fast´n furious. Check it out, it´s worth watching it. I thought it was George CLOONEY, as the voice of BUZZ, it sounded similar, but it was Tim ALLEN. Solid entertainment for the kids...; Great animation, great voice cast. A wonderful film for children, but as an adult, I thought there was a total lack of any good jokes. All the songs seemed unnecessary and the story was pretty weak for a film so hailed by adult critics. But the 3D animation is really groundbreaking, my jaw hit the ground several times, and that's what this film is all about. ****(out of five) A Triumph For Disney!; \"Toy Story\" has been said to be the first great fully computer animated feature ever.  And I must agree.  Computer animation has been used before, in movies like \"Tron.\"  But only in \"Toy Story\" has it been used with such great effect.  Seeing animation like this is impressive.  Truly cinematic history was made with this movie!  The technology may be improving past the level it had achieved when \"Toy Story\" was made.  But you just can't forget this milestone! It's okay but over hyped; I saw Toy Story in theaters when it first came out and it was alright but I wasn't impressed. Over the years I've come to dislike it rather than feeling neutral toward it. The concept of the movie wasn't new to me because I had already seen the Jim Henson film The Christmas Toy which was basically the same but instead of Woody the cowboy being the main character it was a tiger plush toy named Rigby and I prefer puppetry over CG anyway. Given that this movie was made in the early days of CG the people look really weird and fake, almost creepy, even the good characters. It seems to mainly focus on the petty squabbles between the jealous cowboy and the delusional spaceman. While the film has a few jokes the kids might not get, my over all impression is that the whole story lacks depth. You could maybe read between the lines and infer things but the movie glosses over most of the more serious stuff to keep the mood light. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable either. Toy Story; Total Classic Disney movie, One of the best ever made in my opinion! Long loved by adults and children alike! Its a great animation about....(well if the title didn't give it away) Toys, And their adventures while in the care of Andy, a young boy who's favourite toy used to be sheriff Woddy (voiced by Tom Hanks)a cowboy doll, until one day on his birthday he receives a space doll, Buzz lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) Woody isn't too happy when he finds he has been replaced by a space toy and immediately holds a grudge over Buzz. Woody is surprised to find out that this 'Space Toy' doesn't even know he is a toy, And wouldn't believe it if you told him. Fed up over being replaced Woody tries to dispose of Buzz, the plan fails of course...but it starts Buzz and Woody on an adventure of a lifetime...or 'toytime'...which eventually brings them close together! Must see for all Disney Fans! Infinity and beyond from Disney and Pixar!; Disney and Pixar studios team up and brought us an imaginative adventure story about a little boy named Andy who loves playing with his toys, with his best friend being a cowboy doll named Woody. However, when Andy and not body else is looking, the toys come to life. Woody is the leader of the toys in Andy's room, which include a Mr. Potato Head, Slinky the Dog, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Pig and Bo-Peep the girl doll. However, when Andy's get new toy space ranger Buzz Lightyear for his birthday, Buzz takes the place of Woody of being leader of the toys and Andy's new best friend. Brewing with jealously, Woody attempts to get rid of Buzz, but both ended up lost outside of Andy's house. As a result, they must find their way back to Andy's house before they move - first trying to get through Andy's weird neighbor and toy torturer Sid. This is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation - very detailed and realistic. The story is full of surprises and adventure, from Woody and Buzz getting lost in a pizza shop to them trying to break loose out of Sid's house to get back to Andy's. The movie is also filled with comedy; you will have to watch the movie to appreciate and understand the humor only live toys could make. And, there are toe-tapping songs you would learn to love including Randy Newman's opening song \"You've Got a Friend in Me.\" While this movie's plot is full of non-stop fun and adventure, making every moment exciting and entertaining, the film also concentrates on friendship and teamwork and overcoming all odds. While I mostly enjoyed this movie, I wished that Woody was not made out to be hated on so much by the other toys after Woody's jealous behavior towards Buzz. I thought this takes away at Woody's hero status too much especially for his first movie. But overall, this is one of Disney's best work, which will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination. Also, hands down to a great voice cast: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts and Jim Varney. Grade B+ One of the great movies of all time; I enjoy watching this movie over and over. It is structured so carefully, I can pick up from any point and be immersed. I love reading about how it was made just as much as watching it, and collect books about Pixar and the making of these films. But as much as I enjoy the craft and history of Toy Story, I also think it deserves credit for its influence. It's just too bad that all the filmmakers that think they're working from the Toy Story template are missing the main ingredient: story. Pixar worked and reworked this script for years and refused to quit until they got it right. Woody and Buzz, Pizza Planet, Andy's Bedroom, Sid--I only wish I had appreciated it for what it was upon its release. But I get it now. And I will be there for whatever this company does next. A great start for good old Pixar; The story is quite predictable, but at least it makes up with the heart and execution. The animation, while dated now, was great for its time. The characters are memorable and lovable So overall, nice job Pixar. The Best Animated Movie; This is probably the best animated movie I've ever seen. The story-line and the pace of the movie keeps you pretty engaged. Tom Hanks as Woody is simply the best character introduced in an animated movie. I think should do more voice-overs. And the 2 sequels are also very good. IT'll surely bring back your childhood memories. It's a pure entertainer. Hands Down My Favorite Disney FIlm.; I just recently saw the Toy Story, Toy Story 2 double feature and it was amazing seeing this movie on the big screen after all this time. In my opinion this is the best movie Pixar has made so far, and it will be hard to top it. The animation is flawless and all of the characters are so lovable, you actually forgot that they are toys and not real people. The plot is actually really inventive and the idea of toys being jealous of one another is really fun. I think this movie is perfect for people of any age because the humor can be enjoyed by anyone. Obviously it's the perfect movie for kids, but it's great for adults too. Tim Allen and Tom Hanks lend their voices as the main characters in this film, and they are perfect in it. Overall, this movie is genuine animated classic! \"You've Got A Friend in Me...\"; I literally can't stop singing every time I hear Randy Newman play one of the greatest songs of all time. Anyway, Toy Story is one of the my all-time, no-holds barred, #1 movies of i've ever seen . Toy Story begins when Andy gets a new toy called Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen) and a bitter rivalry between Woody(Tom Hanks)and Buzz ensues. After a trick to get Buzz Lightyear stuck between a drawer goes terribly wrong, Woody knows that he can't show his face back in Andy's room without Buzz Lightyear. After an unhappy reunion at the Gas Station and a misadventure at Pizza Planet, Woody and Buzz are soon kidnapped by a sinister kid named Sid Phillips. Now, Woody and Buzz must reconcile and together, they will either think up a plan to get out of the Sid's house or be doomed under the filthy hands of the crazy kid himself. Also starring Jim Varney(From \"Hey Vern, It's Ernest!\" and all the Ernest movies) as Slinky and Don Rickles(From \"Dennis the Menace Strikes Again\" and \"Beach Blanket Bingo\") as Mr. Potato Head, Toy Story will not only have you rolling on the floor laughing, it will warm your heart. This movie is so passionate, so comical, and so heart-warming, that it spawned off two great sequels beloved for generations to come. I definitely recommend this movie to Toy Story lovers everywhere! Awesome Animated Movie!; Toy Story 3 may not be the best animated movie ever, but this is still one of them, beats the crap out of that crappy Wall-E! Anyway, it follows Woody and the toys, Woody gets jealous of Buzz Lightyear, their owners new favorite toy which of replaced Woody. Woody knocks Buzz out the window, and the other do the same to Woody because of what he did to Buzz. They both fall, then they go over to Andy's moms van, and they hitch a ride. They end up at the gas station, fight, and take the Pizza Planet car. They get there, get stuck in a toy machine with some rubber aliens, and the mean kid, Sid, gets them. And he takes them to his house, where he tortures them. And now we have our movie, did I mention the people don't know the toys are alive? No, well they don't. And this movie as amazing animation, it's perfect. Highly recommend this amazing animated movie. Ground Breaking Animation!; Toy Story is hands down the best animated film of all times. It's also a groundbreaking film with computer animation and it allowed more movie producers to explore the art. Fortunately that did happen because nowadays animated movies are staples in movie making. This is about a toy cowboy named Woody who is the favorite toy of his owner, Andy. He gets jealous when Andy gets a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. It only gets worse when both of them are missing and get stuck in evil Sid's room. The voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are probably the best well-known voices in animated films. The music by Randy Newman is fantastic. The songs and score alike are fantastic and memorable. Overall, this is the best animated film of all times and it spawned two very good sequels. I rate this film 10/10. Perfect! A badge to be worn proudly by Pixar.; Of course my opinion, but truly,honestly perfect! It is an amazing standalone, kid, and Pixar film with all the great motifs of all. It teaches children good values about who are in the world, and mortality. It also appeals to all ages and has incredible animation for 1995, and also was great enough to be unforgotten all the way until now 2015, 20 years later. Buzz's realization that he is just another product to be sold in the world, is in my opinion, one of the greatest moments of movie and entertainment history. The movie gives you a lot of things to speculate on like is Woody a bad toy? Or can a movie have virtually no villain but the hero or at all? The choice is 100% yours and that is what I love most about the movie. It is absolutely timeless and unforgettable and I highly suggest watching it.  This movie was one of the best 3d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an 8.5.(I gave it an 8) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of 3d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! The first full length CGI movie; Toy Story has become at the time of that recording 21 years old. Twenty One!! This the most influential animated movie since Snowwhite and the Seven Dwarfs, which is the every first full length movie and it came out in 1937!! OK to pull myself together ,I am pretty sure that the majority of you, who read this is under 18 and can not think of a time before all animated movies used CGI. And the amazing part is almost everyone though that Toy Story would be flop and their luck of faith, although disturbing, was way off. Also the characters like Woody, Buzz, Rex and the rest of the gang have rooted in pop culture and its sequels are awesome in their own right. In all honesty I cannot choose which of the three is better I love them all equally. To summaries Toy Story is one of the best family flick ever made and you should show it to your kids and maybe re-watch, yourself dear writer, all the trilogy with the Toy Story 4 coming out in 2017!  \n",
       "1  Wonderful adventure; My opinion: Do not underrate this movie that much. I didn't particularly like it - in fact I almost forgot about it for many years - but the story is simply very, very smart. The idea behind the plot is utter genius. Okay, the actual transformation did not work perfectly, but I insist that it was still a straight accomplishment that had 1. a nice cast, 2. sustainable visual effects and achievements, 3. a great story, 4. both funny and entertaining sequences, that even made you pause and think sometimes, which I regard as a major attainment of any movie. So - I'll give it a solid 7, which it deserves at least. Considering it has Robin Williams in it, it is okay.; I am not really a huge fan of Robin Williams, his type of humor does not usually work for me. In fact, I always thought Mork and Mindy was where he did his best comedy. This movie is about a boy who disappeared while playing a board game. His sister who was playing at the time saw him disappear into said game and is basically a bit crazy later in her life thanks to this incident. Two children find and play this game one day and to their surprise the boy who disappeared has reappeared thanks to a roll of the dice. They now have to continue to play the game as things begin to pelt them, animals run amok, and a determined continually hunts the foursome down. The effects are okay for the time, but they are the type of effects that are in to many movies these days. The type that looks like they are there, but at the same time they do not. The comedy is okay, Robin Williams does not get as worked up in this one as he usually does in his films and you also get to see a young Kristen Dunst. This one coming out after her appearance in Interview with a Vampire. David Alan Grier also stars as a cop who gets caught up in the game as near the end the game really begins to cause quite a lot of chaos. Still, it is an effects driven family film so the story is a bit shallow. So worth a chuckle and it does have a lot to look at, but at times it seems almost like you are watching a video game rather than watching four people play a board game. Not board; Watched this on TV where it was aired as a tribute to the late Robin Williams. It's an enjoyable family-entertainment fantasy adventure with Williams playing a grown man who as a boy was sucked into a mysterious, dark board game called Jumanji, freed years later by a couple of young children who happen upon the game when they move into Williams's character by this time run-down house. Along with Williams also fully-grown girl friend of the time Kirsten Dunst, the four of them brave everything the game throws at them to finish it and free Williams to return to his old life. And does the game throw everything at them! Crazy monkeys, a roaring lion, a jungle which comes to life, hordes of stampeding elephants zebras and rhinos and one very persistent big game hunter. A veritable special effects fest, while the plot amounts to no more than awaiting the outcome of the next roll of the dice on the board, it all makes for good clean exciting fun and who amongst us as never enjoyed playing a board game as a child. The back stories about Williams being bullied as a child, having a fractious relationship with his dad and his adult wooing of Dunst are lightly drawn but all of course resolved happily ever after by the end. Williams is fine after he makes his delayed first appearance, portraying yet again a child trapped in a man's body just as he did in a line going back through Peter Pan in \"Hook\", \"Popeye\" all the way to his breakout part in \"Mork and Mindy\". Dunst offers good support and the kids aren't too gauche and sentimental either. Nice to see \"Cheers\" Bebe Neuwirth get a decent part too. I wouldn't call it Robin Williams defining role but as an update on the old children's matinée features, this was an entertaining feature made the better by Williams engaging performance. R.I.P. to him. Underrated, I think; This film is a lot better than others have ranked it. It deserves more than a 6 average. I gave it a 7 and believe it's underrated. The basic story is that years ago, while a child, Robin Williams was transported into the game he was playing at the time and trapped there. Later, two other children find the game board and play it, releasing a now grown up Williams, along with all sorts of dangerous animals and vines and stuff. These things threaten mankind and it's up to Williams, along with Bonnie Hunt, to find a way to stop these things from killing off man. There's a good bit of suspense and with every move the heroic folks make, something counteracts it and things nearly always end up being worse than before. They finally determine that the only way to end the horror is to finish the game that Williams started all those years ago. Now, if they could only find the game board. This is a well written adaptation of a popular book, and I found it quite entertaining. a game not like the other ones; \"Jumanji\" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game \"jumanji\" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy. Watchable Effects-laden family entertainer, though a bit predictable; This is a watchable family entertainer with some genuine scares. The plot appears complicated but is actually fairly simple. Hordes of wild animals appear and people flee. This happens again and again like clockwork throughout the film making it predictable after a while. On the plus side, Robin Williams is in manic form, and the Special Effects are agreeable though dated. Kirsten Dunst is very appealing in one of her earlier films. This is generally a pleasant watch, but on the whole, I prefer the newer film Zathura, which is also based on a board game. Overall 6/10 18 years of being a \"favourite\"; I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and \"Jumanji\" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie & it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life. Has more depth than the book, but lacks much of its lustre; When I was in fifth Grade, I read a book called Jumanji. It was a 1982 book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera. A year later (February or March 1996), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In 1869, two young chaps bury in a chest \"Jumanji\", a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy. 100 years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in 1969, but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight\"; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic 1995, where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost... Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm. The other three characters, but the movie is so focused on the four players that everyone else looks like a decoration set. The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining . But the screenplay touches on the drama scenes so lightly that they do not create much justice to the film. The anarchic present looks like a throwback of Back to the Future II's Alternate 1985. But all ends well at the conclusion, and people will find it likable, including those who read the book. By the way, this was the first time I heard about Kirsten Dunst... **1/2 out of **** HORRIBLE!; This was on TV again recently, and naturally the kids stopped to watch it. Why I will never know. We own a copy and they rarely if ever put it in the VCR. Whose idea was this movie? Joe Johnston, the guy responsible for some of the worst movies of the 1990s and whose only really decent film was HONEY, which was way back when? I have said previously this is really a horror movie in disguise and obviously not a particularly good one. What in hell is with the special effects? Is there a worse-looking set of animals in film history? I wonder all these years later if maybe the distorted, cartoonish look of the monkeys and lion were intentional, since they sprang from a children's board game. But then why do the elephants, rhinos, pelican and even the oversized mosquito, look relatively normal? Robin Williams is about as bad as he ever got, except for the nightmarishly bad JACK (although I never saw his ripoff of Benigni, which I can just imagine to what depths he plummets, and I forgive him WHAT DREAMS MAY COME since he obviously did not write or direct that fiasco). View JUMANJI at your own mental peril! One of my favourite films ever; This film is great, it is definitely a family film (little kids might get scared when there are *SPOILER* guns shooting or when the giant spiders have surrounded the actors,or when a crocodile attacks the man but apart from that it isn't too scary), but it is one of those films everyone has got to see. I first watched this film when it first came onto TV (they now repeat it every year), and I have been captivated by the imaginative story every single time I've seen it. The basic storyline is that two kids find an old board game, but when they start playing, the madness begins- stampeding animals and more! This is a story about friendship, love, sticking together and much, much more. If you haven't seen this film already WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!! Action and adventure for the kids, and Robin Williams for the adults; Find a comfortable chair, lay out the board, grab the dice, and get ready to play.  But remember:  once you start this game, you can't stop.  If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must. \"Jumanji\" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  The basic premise stays the same:  a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure.  When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things.  Only finishing the game will make it all go away. In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added.  Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself.  He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing.  The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams!  Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter. Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles.  He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt.  The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the \"This is MY baby\" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike. Not for 13+ age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for 1980 not for 1995. Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. I love this movie so much; If you do not love this movie you are crazy. Its filled with action and excitement. I love Sarah Whittle played by the famous Bonnie Hunt. I also like Carl Bentley, a clueless police officer played by the comedian David Alan Grier. This movie is so creative. My sister and I watch the movie every weekend, we do not get tired of it. This movie did not get the awesome rating it deserved. People sometimes do not understand a quality move when they see one. I would strongly, strongly, strongly recommend the movie. Trust me you will love it to death. If you do not... then you are odd. Please watch the movie, try it you'll love it...duh!!! A great movie; JUMANJI I loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today! The movie is about a boy who finds a board game called Jumanji. When he takes it home and starts to play it with a friend, he soon realises that this is no ordinary game. He gets sucked into the game and is not released again until 26 years later 2 more kids find the game and release him. Now he is grown up and has to find a way to end this game before everything it releases destroys the town. Due to the sad passing of the genius that was Robin Williams, the TV channels have decided to show all of his movies. Jumanji was the first one I saw. The story to this film is like not her that I had seen before. It was an original idea (unless there is another film I don't know about) that was just so imaginative. It works really well and has a great adventure element about it. The effects are average. This was made in the mid 90s so that probably has something to do with it. The animals were obviously not real. You could see the lion was so mechanical it made me laugh. And the other animals were so obviously computer generated. But it was comical and that just added to the fun of the film. The acting was great. The main character was played by Robin Williams. He was as energetic and full of character in this role, just like he brought to every role he took. Other cast members were Jonathan Hyde, a young Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bonnie Hunt. Bonnie Hunt was brilliant. Her reaction and facial expressions made me laugh a few times in this. Another stand out performance was by David Alan Grier. David was so funny as the cop. His comedy timing was excellent and deserves a mention. This film really does keep you entertained throughout and is just a lot of fun to watch... Even now nearly 20 years later. I will give this 7 out of 10. Normally I end my reviews with a quote from the movie, but this time I just want to say how gutted I am about the news of Robins death. I am a fan of his work. I watched Mork and Mindy when I was a kid and grew up watching Jumanji, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam, Jack etc... There were so many great films that he made. I always saw Robin as so full of energy and full of life. He had one of the greatest smiles in Hollywood and when i saw an interview with him, he seemed so chirpy and happy. It just shows that in front of the camera, you never know what is going on in people's heads. I was sad to hear he had been suffering from depression. Depression is such a deadly illness. I know this sounds stupid, but I am gutted that I was not there to talk to him, help him. I hate to think that he felt so alone, especially as he had millions of fans all over the world that knew him on screen. He made the world laugh out loud so many times. Even through bad times in my life, watching his movies has put a smile on my face. Robin deserved much more happiness than he got. He gave so much to me and the rest of the world and it doesn't seem right that he should end his life this way. I will miss seeing new movies from him, but will always continue to go back to enjoy his old ones. Robin will live on in my house and he will always continue to make me smile. R.I.P. Robin Williams. Jumanji  a timeless adventure story; There are few children's movies that I particularly enjoyed  I can recount The Borrowers, Labyrinth and The Neverending Story. Jumanji, however takes a new place among children's films  in fact, it may seem that initially, Jumanji is about simplistic story about kids playing a board game. Based on a gorgeous picture book story of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg, this movie takes a beautiful magical adventure and makes it into a thrill ride that defies all natural laws. Time travel, physical transformations, perceptual distortions and multiple universes are just a few of the things that Jumanji toys with. The most evident phenomena is that the characters run in two different and parallel universes, one where Jumanji exists, and the other where it is just a dream. The life of Judy and Peter as orphans exists in a different world from the one where Jumanji doesn't exist  in other words, Jumanji is a catalyst of fate, an evil entity that does not bring about awe as it did in Allsberg's book, but fear. The world that Allen Parrish is doomed to be incarcerated in the jungles of Jumanji is another one, but that period of time is nonexistent in the world he will eventually live in. This is the beauty of the movie; that these characters can only allow their trauma and epiphanies to cross worlds. With each roll of the dice, the characters grow and change. The ending with 'Jumanji' is mark of the end of that universe  everything that the jungle world had yielded, from the colonist-hunter Van Pelt to the roaring stampede and the monkeys had to return, to be sealed into the game and the universe. The game controls life; but it is merciful when played to the end without cheating. The mental agony and pain must have been tremendous for the Parrishes. Presumably, Alan spent his twenty six years in the jungle, but returned to his old self only to again relive his life as if it never happened. The temporal distortion must have presumably had an effect on his parents, although only Sarah seems to notice. (She was playing the game  and only those playing are directly affected, but in the game universe of Judy and Peter we see a problem in the movie's understanding of temporal change) The power of fate in deciding the endgame was critical in the film. It seems that the game was in itself a game of a game; it was all planned out and ready to go. In fact, it also seems that no matter how crazy or perilous the situation is, the characters cannot be killed. Even Van Pelt says at the Sir Sav A Lot that \"I am hunting only Alan. I won't kill you, since you didn't roll\" He too is bound to the rules of the game, no matter how much of a colonialist he is. The game instills a high level of fear without death, in order for the game to continue, all the characters must be present. So in one way, no one need be scared of anything in the game. Instead, the game builds resilience in the characters. It was natural that in the end the end was initiated by the future; or more appropriately the past. At the end, both Sarah and Alan make up for the trouble they have caused and have a life bond from the experience. The jumping between 1994 and 1964 is a critical aspect where we see that the horrors of the game have allowed Judy and Peter's parents to not die in the ski accident. They are oddly willing to put an end to their vacation when they hardly know the Parrishes \"In the jungle, you must wait, until you roll a five or eight\"  Jumanji \"Roll a two, roll a four, but never ask for more\"  Gautam RATING: 10/10 (amazing) Great fun; Robin Williams is in his element as an adult/child and with wonderful support from Kirsten Dunst, Ian Richardson playing the Englishman hunter and sending himself up nicely, the excellent children and others make this escapist adventure at it's best. A Dazzling Film!; I liked Jumanji. It is way better than I thought it would be. The story starts out with the burying of a game in 1869. It is then uncovered by a boy named Alan, 100 years later. As he is playing it, he gets sucked into the game until someone rolls a 5 or an 8. That happened 26 years later. Now along with two kids and a woman who was playing the game with Alan in 1969, Alan has to finish the game despite all the creatures appearing out of the game. The special effects are amazing. They were effective and used well. The acting is decent. Robin Williams did a good job as he usually does. I did think that Hunter Van Pelt could've been more realistic. The music is pretty good. I always liked James Horner's music. There are only minor flaws here or there. I rate this movie 9/10. Better than the sequel!; I really enjoyed this movie. I saw the sequel first, and then the \"original\" and I must say I am impressed and surprised by the way the movie worked. And I enjoyed it a lot. It's a board game that, when you roll dice, the numbers state where your piece should go, and then a message appears. The message could be something like, \"run away before the lion gets you\" and sure enough, a lion will suddenly appear in your house, ready to get you! I rate this 8/10 because of the fact that there was mild swearing, and I thought it was pushing it with the kiss at the end. But overall I enjoyed the movie! Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Welcome to the jungle, we've got fun and games; Oh yes, another childhood favourite starring the late-great Robin Williams, a true master of his craft. Jumanji simply put is a bundle of fun, why analyse a film like this? Truth is you shouldn't, just sit back and let the wacky action take you away..., it has wild animals, a dangerous board game and a throwback from the 19th century, intent on murdering Alan (poor Robin Williams!) So as a child Alan discovers a board game called Jumanji, but this is no ordinary game, he enlists his good friend Sarah to play it with him, unfortunately for the poor lad, he rolls the wrong number and gets sucked into the game, for many years. Years later, two kids Judy and Peter rediscover the game that had been hidden and decide to play, quickly releasing Alan from his jungle prison, from here on in the action is frantic and joyous, with a race around town, an adult Sarah joining the game and many-many mishaps as the quartet anxiously try to complete the game and get to the end. Who on earth thought a film about a board game could be so good? Masterful, cute and camp comedy by the legend of the genre helps to lift the film up to lofty heights, a very young Kirsten Dunst and an always reliable Bonnie Hunt put in professional performances as well..., a proper Sunday afternoon film that's a surefire way to boost moral. For 1995 when Jumanji was released, the special effects and computer generated imagery were spectacular, to make the variety of animals appear so lifelike was amazing..., the carnage that spreads across town was well shot and the cinematographer and art department team had a real good eye for detail. There's a new Jumanji film soon to be released, kind of a sequel to this film starring The Rock, but the new film will have to go some way to living up to the original, I doubt it will be anywhere near the quality and enjoyment that this film possesses, The Rock instead of Robin Williams, and that's going to work how? Sit down, relax and enjoy, with Jumanji it's as simple as that. Brilliant family entertainment!; While I try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, I do think the rating for this film is too low. The film is absolutely fantastic in all departments. I will admit, there are some bits that are quite scary due to some scenes that are amazingly dark. The film does start off slowly, but when the film fast forwards to twenty six years later, the film turns into fast-paced family entertainment. Other than one or two scary scenes and the slow beginning, I could find very little wrong with Jumanji. The story is great, very intriguing and filled with humour, scares and poignancy. The cinematography and scenery are constantly breathtaking, and the special effects are extraordinary. The film is aided by a hilarious and poignant script, spirited direction, atmspheric music and the fact that it goes at a very fast pace. Even the acting was great, with Robin Williams in one of his best performances as Alan Parrish. While he is subtle in places, the director allows him to be funny, which is what he does best. Bonnie Hunt is good too and she and Williams have great chemistry, and Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst are cute and lively. Plus the ending is nice and satisfying. All in all, I love this movie, even with its very minor problems, it is non-stop fast paced family entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Exciting Family Adventure; In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called \"Jumanji\", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished. Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human. The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like \"Dead Poet's Society\" or \"Good Morning, Vietnam\"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality. This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor. Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the \"Narnia\" stories). Fortunately, any moralising in \"Jumanji\" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of \"alternative timelines\". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10 Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is 1969, and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats. 26 years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good! wild CGI destruction gets repetitive; In 1869, two boys bury a mysterious dangerous wooden chest. In 1969 Brantford, New Hampshire, young Alan Parrish gets picked on by bullies. He finds the box in a local construction site. He opens the chest to find a board game Jumanji. His father is sending him to boarding school. He is about to run away when his best friend Sarah Whittle comes by. They play the game and Alan is pulled into the board game. Twenty six years later, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) buys the rundown mansion planning to open a bed-and-breakfast. She brings her niece Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter (Bradley Pierce) who lost their parents in a car accident. The kids find the board game in the attic and start playing it. Alan (Robin Williams) is released. They track down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) to finish the game and bring all the released apparitions to an end. Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) was a friend who worked at Alan's shoe factory and is now a cop. The game brings out big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) who looks like Alan's father Sam. The basic idea of a board game that comes alive is one with great possibilities. I wish that it is more than just a series of crazy CGI destruction. I wish that the players needed to use their brain power to solve clues. The constant escaping from one thing to the next gets a little bit repetitive. They start piling on top of one another. Williams is not quite as lovable as expected. Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier are kind of fun. There is an uncontrolled quality to this children's movie. i miss my childhood; 6.6,,,,,,,,,,,,, i don't believe this. 10 people 10,,, anyone who have watched this as a kid will give this a 10... common for heavens sake,,, this is the best fantasy movie that some one could wish for as a kid.......... for heavens sake this movie was not made keeping logic in mind please,, its just fun,,, thats all it is,,,this movie is one of the best memories A KID OF 90S HAVE AS A KID,,,people who hate this movie can go to hell,,,, any parents out there please let your kids watch this,,, they will love you a lot..these are the kind of movies which make me miss my childhood ,,, Jumanji Lays Down The Smack!; This is a great Hollywood thrill ride of a movie.  I loved the idea for this flick, a mystical board game coming to life.  What's great about this film is that for once Robin Williams isn't doing his usual \"Robin Williams\" stand-up schtick.  He's playing an original character and it's about time too, daddy-o. This movie is a great blend of thrills, special effects and laughs.  I like how it uses a lot of the old jungle movie icons like the Great White British Hunter, giant crocs, lions, mischievous monkeys and rhinos.  And even the actual Jumanji game board itself looked cool!  I wanted to own one.  I write screenplays myself on occasion and this film made me wanna write my own special effects extravaganza! But go checkety check out Jumanji and have a great time at the movies. Dig?  Dangerous Boarding Game; In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called \"Jumanji\" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan's father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. \"Jumanji\" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90's. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Jumanji\" Watts meets New England; Disaster visits a New England town: When all hell breaks loose, when beasts from nowhere trample the streets and earthquakes rip the blocks and giant mosquitoes and God-knows-what-next befall the descendants of pilgrims and fishermen, of Minutemen and revolutionaries and of immigrants yearning to breath free, those same hard-scrabble, salt-of-the-earth, no-nonsense patriots all join hands, pull together, and-- . . . loot their neighbors' downtown storefronts! Unbelievable.  Tinseltown belts out a fairly well-done and imaginative fantasy (which truly `Jumanji' is), and then--wouldn't you know it?--foul it with one of the many flies stuck in the ointment that is Hollywood, a scene so diagnostic of the intellectual sickness that has infested the industry since Hellman sang her praises to Stalin.  Then again, maybe it is believable. `Jumanji's' only other flaws: a part too small for the underrated Bebe Neuwirth (a joy to watch always and here no less so), kids full of bravery that's a little too scripted and moments of suspense that really aren't. If we can ignore all that, even the brief bit of class-warfare propaganda, then \"Jumanji' becomes eminently watchable, even memorable. But promise us you won't loot any stores next time you see monkeys charging down the street. If I could go back...; I love this movie. I don't know why. Maybe because I wonder what it would be like to start my life over again when I was 10 or 12, knowing what I know now at...well, much older. My favorite part is at the end, when Alan and Sarah come face to face in 1995 with the 2 kids who played the game with them the PREVIOUS 1995. Visually very interesting and not a rip off of any other film, that's for sure! When your life hangs on a simple roll of dice...; NOTE: this comment is provided by Christopher Dorian and Peter Rhydon. When young Alan Parish and his friend Sarah Wittle sat in Alan's living room and began playing to that strange game named \"Jumanji\", neither them, nor the audience, could have expected what was coming after. Because \"Jumanji\" is not your parents' \"Payday\". The game instructions are simple: roll the dice and the player who reaches the end first is the winner. It's just in-between that things go a little bit different... What was just a little game meeting transforms into a special effects extravaganza, filled with all sorts of creatures and eye-catching action scenes and stunts that seem to be borrowed from the best moments of the Indiana Jones adventures. The computerized special FX are the main aspects of the movie and they mostly succeed to their task. While they may look archaic today, remember that these visual tricks were created in 1995, and that computer-driven movies were a new sensation. Looking at the lion's faces isn't completely interesting, but it's worth the effort. Action scenes are well conceived, well acted, and well pictured. Particularly memorable is the crocodile fight in the flooded house, with the characters trying to defend themselves like the Orca crew in \"Jaws\". Those two points are tightly linked with one man: director Joe Johnston, who previously made \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\" and \"The Pagemaster\". He clearly shows that his former employers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had a huge effect on him and that he gets inspiration from those two phenomenons. And when we see the final result, we could feel that Johnston could become a phenomenon too. But it isn't the case. And why? Because \"Jumanji\" relies on a quicksand storyline and poor lines, because characters are occasionally believable and because action scenes are not epic in the Star Wars or Indiana Jones style. The concept is excellent, but the developed elements are not on the same level. Characters are often performing in cliché and predictable scenes, instead of innovative situations. If we talk about the actors, one should prevail from the others: Robin Williams. Even if his grinning smile looks stuck on his face like The Joker, he is a convincing jungle raider and his performance is fantastic, whatever it is for dramatic, terrifying or comic moments. What is also good about the film is that it can be enjoyed by people from all ages. Children will be delighted and excited by the animals depicted here and adults will enjoy the magnitude of the special effects employed during the film. The dialog is generally well suited for a general audience and there is no real troubling or disturbing moment. It's good to see that the '90s still deals with that kind of stuff. Technological developments imply more and more sophisticated video games of all kinds, but it's heart-warming to see that classic board games can provide excitement like this. After seeing that movie, playing \"Monopoly\" would seem to be like a tea party or some other kind of silly joke. Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... Epitome of Moronic Hollywood Film-Making; A previous reviewer wrote: \"A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie.\" I agree in part and disagree in part with that comment. The problem is impossible to pinpoint, because there are PLENTY of \"big problems\" with this movie! \"Random hazard generator\" is the PERFECT description of the ancient board game! Random hazard after random hazard until the game ends is what is supposed to pass for \"plot\" in this movie. Did anybody count how many times the game board fell out of and back into the players' hands? That, too is supposed to pass for tension. Ultimately, the film fails because there isn't any development of the back story. What was the origin of the game? Now, that would have been an interesting question to explore! And how does the game work? All we ever see is the game's projection of \"random hazards\" OUTWARD into the reality of the players, but somehow Alan (Robin Williams) apparently was sucked INTO the game. How did that happen, and why doesn't it happen to any of the current players of the game? Actually, the guy in the pith helmet is, more or less, the human villain in this movie, but he is never more than an inexplicable, evil cartoon. Was he, too sucked into the game like Alan, or is he the sole human \"random hazard\" generated by the game? Why is he so determined, not to hunt animals, but to MURDER Alan? The film just glosses over the fact that this sub-plot is actually one of premeditated murder! The hunter guns for Alan simply because the plot demands it. But the movie makes no attempt whatever to explain the character. Never once did I sense any genuine emotional chemistry among the characters. Just a bunch of actors acting - not INTERACTING. The love story sub-plot felt obligatory, never genuine. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt never generated enough chemistry to make me care whether Alan and Sarah got together in the predictable end. All in all, this film has the germ of an interesting idea that is really wasted by focusing on mindless, non-stop \"random hazards,\" poor CGI effects, \"lots of screaming and running around\" and insufficient character development. Except for the precise nature of each \"random hazard,\" the whole film was disappointingly predictable, including the cliché of the almost-kiss in the midst of peril routine. How many zillion times has that been used? The dialog is a similarly endless stream of clichés. The issue was never HOW the game would end - but WHEN. The more interesting issues were never even glanced at. This kind of movie can only appeal to people raised on video games. It was generated by that kind of adventure-for-the-sake-of-adventure mentality, and it has that same kind of feel. This Ain't No Game!; CONTAINS SPOILERS In 1869, two boys bury something unknown but whatever it is, it's very dangerous. It stays for 100 years. In 1969, young Alan Parrish rides his bike one lovely day, unfortunately he's soon chased by Billy Jessup and his gang. Alan goes to his father, Samuel's shoe factory. Alan tells his father what's up, but his father merely tells him that he must stand and face something you're afraid of, so Alan did and got the crap kicked out of him. Suddenly, he heard drums beating. It was in a construction site. He dug up a wooden board game called Jumanji. At home, Alan's parents have announced that they shall send him to Cliffside School for Boys. Alan refuses to go. Samuel get's mad and storms out of the house with his wife. Alan's friend, Sarah Widdle, comes over that night and the two decide to play the game Alan found. It resulted in Alan being sucked into the game until someone would roll a 5 or 8. 26 years later-1995. A woman named Nora, her niece Judy and nephew Peter buy the old Parrish house. One aternoon, while Aunt Nora left for the office and the kids were about to leave for school when they hear drums beating. The game was calling. They dig it out of the attic and decide to play it. Out of the game comes monkeys, mosquitos and a lion! Also, Alan comes out. He's very grateful, then goes to the old shoe factory to find his parents. He learns of their passing; by finishing the game, they can put an end to the wild animal attacks, so the three go off to find Sarah Widdle, because according to the game, it was her turn. At first she was reluctant to play, but she did. They encounter a huge pod plant and a hunter, Van Pelt who wants to kill Alan for some reason. Well, after braving a stampede, a huge rain fall, giant spiders and an earthquake, the game was over and all went back to 1969 where Alan patched things up with his father, he and Sarah get rid of the game and live happily ever after in the bright and cheerful 1995, rather than the dark one Jumanji had created. Pretty good movie! Nice special effects. Robin Williams was good, as always. Bonnie Hunt was good. The kids were too. Kirsten Dunst grew up to play Spiderman's love interest. Also, the same actor that plaus Samuel Parrish (Jonathan Hyde of Richie Rich) also plays Van Pelt. I hear there's going to be a sequel: Jumanji 2. But it doesn't have Robin Williams. For the life of me, I can't figure out what it will be like. But for now, you gotta see the first one! -- Jumanji! From Book to Film; As a child in 1995, this was one of the greatest adventure films for a kid in my generation. The book from where it came, was good, but the filmmakers made the adaptation pretty darn amazing. The fact that Robin Williams starred made the film better, as Robin was a huge draw to family films of that era. Who ever knew that Jumanji would have a cult following or that it would spawn an actual board game (nothing comes to life), and eventually a sequel in 2017. Too bad Robin isn't here to enjoy or be a part of the sequel. Bonnie Hunt also starred alongside Robin in this film as Sarah, but she's not quite as memorable. Sorry! David Alan Grier also co-starred as Carl the police officer, his acting was somewhat more memorable. One of the most memorable acting performances of the film was Jonathan Hyde as Sam Parrish (Alan's dad) and his dual role as Van Pelt (the hunter from Jumanji). In the end, it was a great film, probably felt more now by some since the passing of Robin Williams. But those of us who've loved the film since the beginning know he made the film what it was. Ignore the critics on this one--it's a great romp that gets better with time!; **Warning--Spoilers** We've owned Jumanji on video since it was released in 1996 and pull it out a couple of times each year for kicks.  It's as fun today as the first time we saw it with plenty of twists and plot turns to keep you hooked through the closing credits.  I've read the reviews by several of the critics on IMDB, and it is obvious they just don't get it. Criticism #1:  \"Jumanji is too scary for kids\":  Our children (ages 2 to 11) have all seen this at an early age and none was ever the slightest bit frightened.  Jumanji doesn't scare kids because 1) the dangers are never prolonged; 2) there is a ton of humor interwoven in the dialogue; and 3) everyone knows it's just a game.  After all, the pranks in Jumanji are no more harmful than what you see in Looney Tunes or Roadrunner & Coyote and kids instinctively get that. Criticism #2: \"Jumanji has no story\": wrong again.  Every time we watch it, something new comes out, particularly in the relationships between the main characters.  There are particularly poignant moments between the father and son characters allowing them to reconcile and overcome the aloofness that can keep men from coming to grips with their feelings toward each other. And, the Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt relationship has a great payoff with romance and their triumph over forces of nature (real and implied). There are also numerous humorous details and themes that run through the film from stampeding rhinos to run-a-muck monkeys that keeping you laughing throughout the entire film. Criticism #3: \"The special effects overwhelm the story\":  The film is based on an animated children's book and the special effects intentionally mirror the artwork from the book.  My kids oohed and ahhed at each and every FX enhanced adventure from the stampeding animals to the wood floor turning to quicksand and in each case the result was to stimulate a great deal of discussion about the ideas in the story.  The monkeys are particularly funny evoking squeals of laughter as they embark on their high jinx. So, don't let bad reviews deter you from seeing this flick.  You and your family will have a great time during the movie and your kids will want to talk about every aspect of Jumanji after it's over, even if it's just an excuse not to go to bed on time! The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for 25(?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\"  So you'll help us?; Robin Williams is incredible as Alan in this outstanding adventure movie. The supporting cast is phenomenal. The costumes are conservative. One of the good films in the genre, Jumanji will dare the viewer to play the game. 7 out of 10. When two kids from the 60's stumble upon a game, one of them is sucked into its jungle.  Now it's up to two present day kids to finish it.; ********/10 This movie deserves more than it received because it is not only a very different plot but has excellent character development, which is key to a great movie. The special effects are so-so (due to the time period in which it was made), but it is overall exciting while humorous. There isn't a movie quite like this one, and is one of my favorites. Robbin Williams is tremendous and while watching it you forget his true identity. Kerstien Dunst is young, but is impressive for her age, commonly not found in some movies. I guess if I'd have to sum this movie up in one word it'd be \"unique\". Not many films have monsoons indoors or mansions turned into jungles. Entertaining...but one major problem; Jumanji is an entertaining movie. I'm surprised its IMDB \"User Rating\" is only 5.9. I would give it a 7. However, I don't understand why the kids (and Robin Williams) keep playing the game. With every roll of the dice, they put their lives in more jeopardy...along with the lives of everyone in the city. They could have stopped anytime after the bats or the mosquitoes or the monkeys or the lion. But they kept going (under the guise of \"finishing the game is the only way to make everything return to normal\"). I kept yelling at the screen, \"Stop playing Jumanji and you'll be okay.\" Of course, if they had stopped playing the game, then there's no movie. not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late 1960s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ A little adventurous... and childish.; Jumanji is a great idea.  The movie has great potential and could have turned out excellent and a true action classic. However, some aspects of the movie prevent that.  For example, the monkeys in the kitchen and abroad hardly look like monkeys.  They look like warped, evil, demonic beings with fur and tails that were only made to cause mischief.  Well, sure, you might say that's what the game meant to do, but come on... I think they should have used real monkeys here. Certain parts of the dialogue are a little corny and make one feel as though we're watching \"Spy Kids\", which can sometimes really ruin the feel that they're in a life-or-death situation. The acting was great (some parts it was not), and as usual, Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst put on an above-average performance. The action and crashes and other sequences are a contradiction, in a way.  Here we have fake-looking monkeys, but superbly crafted action. The music, composed by James Horner, is quite dull and does not help get you into the spirit of the movie.  A lower-than-average job on his part. Overall, this movie is really good.  I would suggest watching it if you can get past some annoying areas of the movie. Almost 20 years on and it's still entertaining kids of all ages; Jumanji was on TV today, and my 8 year old son had liked him in \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and I remembered it being fun, so with sweets and crisps we sat down to watch it. Orphans Judy (A young Kristen Dunst, who had started in \"An Interview With A Vampire\" the previous year, but still a few years away from Spiderman fame) and Peter move in to a mansion with their Aunt (Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers) where the find a board game called Jumanji. When they start playing, they free Alan Parish (Robin Williams) who was trapped in the game when he was a child. Robin Williams is always fun to watch and he was very popular at the time, due to movies like \"Aladdin\" and \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and Kristen Dunst was a real talent as a young actress, none of the annoying traits of usual child actors. Of the supporting cast David Alan Grier is fun as a hapless Police Officer, as is Jonathan Hyde in duel roles as a hunter and young Alan's Dad. Defo worth checking out if you have kids, and more than enjoyable even if you don't. Some of the special effects have dated badly, but are still OK, most of the humour is spot on too. My son got a big kick out if it and really enjoyed it. And I thought for a 19 year old special effects laden kids movie it had held up pretty well. An enjoyable board game, so an enjoyable movie!; This is one of the movies that I really enjoy, even if I do not like comedy and fantasy that much, by the way I don't like Robin Williams either, he thinks he's a funny person, but he isn't, some of his movies like `Jack', `Good Will Hunting', and some others are quite bad. Most of his movies leave too much to be desired. He's just annoying, because it seems to me that he thinks that everybody who sees him will laugh at the ridiculous things he does, he enjoys making fun of the human body, women, men, etc. I dislike it enormously; however I must say that I really enjoyed this movie even though he was starring and the visual effects were obviously computerized. I was impressed by the originality of Jumanji. It's such an innovative, interesting and enjoyable movie. I liked it because the plot is extremely original, creative and gripping. Who on earth would be able to think of a game like Jumanji? An imaginative game in which journeys, action, fantasy, and perhaps a little bit of terror surpass all things. I like this movie because it teaches us to enjoy everyday to its fullest, we see that Alan Parker was a frustrated kid at the beginning of the movie, but after staying in the jungle until the dice read 5 or 8, he realized how worthy his life was. Also it teaches us to respect others, for instance we see the little boy who began to turn into a wolf after cheating on the game was crying and Alan who was a grown-up person then yelled at him, and made him feel bad, but after that he was sorry since he remembered the way his father yelled at him, so this is a valuable lesson, since it shows that parents must be patient and loving to their family, but sometimes love can be hazardous to them. `Jumanji' is a nice movie for all ages; it's a very risky, but enjoyable game, in which your life is at stake. The board game (Jumanji) was good looking, it was really mysterious and interesting, whoever saw it would love to play it. Overall the movie was a very good one, I enjoyed every minute and especially Kristin Dunst's performance who also played in \"Spiderman\", I also enjoyed Mr. Williams's performance, I'm glad he at last did something worth it. Anyway it was an enjoyable movie, but I'd have loved this if it had been more dramatic, terrifying, sad, etc. 8/10 Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. Game You Could Only Dream About; Alan Parrish is the son of wealthy shoe maker Samuel Parrish. But the life of a rich man's son changes when young Alan comes upon a new board game, he is transported into it while playing it. Twenty or so years later two orphaned children, Judy (Kristen Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) come upon the game and play it. Next thing they now, Alan pops out of the game twenty years older along with a lion and some monkeys. It is a race to win the game with Alan (Robin Williams), Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt), Judy, and Peter while trying to outrun stampedes and Van Pelt, the man hunter. The movie has what a movie should have. The interaction of some of then animals is sometimes scary, sometimes funny, and sometimes just strange. Robin Williams is good like always and supported by Dunst, Hunt, and Jonathan Hyde (Van Pelt). It's what some mite call a child thriller. What to classify it as is though but it was good. Jumanji. Starring: Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kristen Dunst, Bradley Pierce, and Jonathan Hyde. 3 out of 5 Stars. Probably not perfect, but very fun; Jumanji is a highly imaginative and very fun movie. The visuals are good, and the story is creative and exciting. The storyline consists of a man being sucked into a board game. 26 years later, two kids find the board game and set him free. However, the game board has already released a few dangers, and those dangers must be stopped. The only way to do that is to finish the board game, and the animals (or whatever else was released from the game) will be put back into the game. There is action and minor thrills, and the movie emerges as being a fun experience. It's kind of creative, and it's an excellent adventure film. Sure, it is a bit cliché'd and the monkeys look pretty corny, but don't let them distract you from the overall enjoyment of the movie. 6.5/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment. A breathless unforgettable adventure!; I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind... This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure. Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story. Great! 10 out of 10 from me! My favorite movie as a child; I first saw this movie when I was 8 or something and I loved it immediately. The idea that you could actually play a game that could have the consequences Jumanji had was awe-inspiring for a kid like me. When I saw it again on TV 2 or 3 years later I taped it and watched it over and over again. At one moment I would lay in my bed and play the movie second by second and word by word in my head. That's how obsessed I was with this film. The action made me want to study biology and major in zoology actually. But I didn't study biology, I am a film student now. And from a film student point of view this movie is, of course, nothing special. The effects aren't perfect, it's no quality film and certainly not Oscar worthy or anything. But from a personal point of view, it still amazes me. When I watch it again it takes me back to my childhood and the amazing visions I had back then of it actually happening in my school and such. For that sense of nostalgia and the memories I have for this movie, I give this a straight 10 out of 10. After all, it was my favorite movie as a child. Brings back a lot of memories. Still a good ride.; My Take: A terrific special effects-laden adventure. JUMANJI is among those films I strongly remember from my childhood. Along with JURASSIC PARK and its sequel, JUMANJI is among those films I enjoy watching multiple times just to see creatures wreck havoc on a crowded street, monsters crawl in from the dark and other bits of special effects extravaganza. I strongly remember the elephants and rhinos stampeding around the crowded streets, a giant man-eating flower with vine-like tentacles, those messy (and weakly done CGI) monkeys with antics borrowed from GREMLINS, the crocodile and the shot of the house breaking apart. What I didn't remember was how faulty the dramatic interludes were. Which is exactly the point. JUMANJI is a wildly entertaining special effects extravaganza that works much better that way. Director Joe Johnston, who revived old-fashioned pulp adventures with THE ROCKETEER and later made JURASSIC PARK III so much better than it might have been, is such an accomplished action director. JUMANJI is a terrific and highly entertaining, if sometimes perilous, family adventure, though it does make several rest stops for back-stories and a bit of drama which sacrifices the pacing. The movie opens with two kids in 1969 with two kids curiously playing the titular game board which eventually unleashes African bats in the fireplace and sucking in little Alan Parrish (then played by Adam Hann-Byrd) inside the game. Forward 26 years later, someone else has bought the old Parrish mansion and the two new kids (Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce) dig up the old board game in the dusty old attic and give the dice a little role, and all hell breaks loose in town. With a little help from an older Alan Parrish (now played by Robin Williams) and his now older best friend Sarah (delightfully played by Bonnie Hunt), they try to finish what they started, unleashing more special effects behemoth after another. That's just about the \"plot\" of JUMANJI, yet I can go on forever with its visual treats. While the CGI doesn't live up to today standards (not to mention the totally unconvincing CGI monkeys!), but some of them in particular (including the terrific sequences where elephants and rhinos rampage around town and inside the mansion living room) still are eye candy. And, courtesy of director Johnston, there are still well-orchestrated moments of excitement. Stars Hunt and co-star David Alan Grier as a cop having a bad day provide the laughs. Despite some dull moments, which have a very major thing to do with its weak writing department, JUMANJI is still an amiable piece of entertainment. Still worth a look, but you might have the options of fast-forwarding to the really good parts. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5. 5 + 5 : « addictive and fun as a real game » (tv); I saw a little bit long ago and it seemed dull then. This time, i start another play right from the start and i found it still dull : the young boy appears a bit dumb, his wealthy family not better \n",
       " And then, first comes teen Dunst and i'm really surprised how good she acted (as she never convinced me as Peter's girlfriend). Next, Robin gets in the movie getting out the game and the magic operates : i really like the way past, present and future merge, how the game expands to the big mansion into town. If the special effects looks very tired, the story is original, full of surprises and proves that a humble cast can do as fine as a multiple billion dollars one ! Robin proved one more time he was a never grown-up kid with a beautiful soul with kids and the key to childish fun ! So i had a great time with this small movie as it gives me all i ask to cinema : to find a way to leave (cautiously) my world behind !! Decent adventure; Well where do I begin. The Casting: I guess the casting was OK. Robin Williams does a decent job, same goes for Kirsten Dunst. I really love the Sara Whittle character, but I am unsure if its because of her written dialog, which I indeed love, or the acting of Bonnie Hunt. I don't know what role the policeman is supposed to play however. I mean he doesn't do anything really important and it seems like he is there just to tie up the loose ends. It is OK though, I would rather have this cop around than just having them loose the game some more, which I think would have been the other alternative. His supposed to be funny moments however is something the movie could've done without. The Story: I really enjoy the story! Its simple, not to serious and perfect for adventure. My problem with it is how the story about the characters end which is a bit counter dramatic. The moral of the story, whatever you perceive it to be, feels meaningless. Since everything just ends up a-okay for everyone. Some people have been complaining that you never get to know the origin of Jumanji or how it looks inside the game. I don't have that problem simply because it would take away all the mystery. The parts of the story I grow tired off is how they loose the game to often. I figure its to add suspense which works at times, but the movie overdoes it. Another thing that I don't really like is how Van Pelt, the hunter, has to buy a new modern rifle. I kind of liked the retro feeling to him, but that disappears when he has an enormous automatic black rifle with night-vision aim rather than his own old rifle. The effects: To be honest, what comes first in my book is acting and story. If you take the old batman movie the effects aren't at all impressive. But that don't stop them from being awesome. Same goes for this, sure the computer effects haven't aged well and the monkeys just look stupid. But it isn't that big a part of the movie. Maybe of the marketing but I've learned you have to take that part of the entertainment business with mountains of salt. I figure I got to much to say about the movie, there is a lot of stuff I haven't talked about, so I'll just stop here and sum my thoughts up. Its imaginative and adventurous with good acting and decent effects. The only part which stops me from giving it a 10 is the \"comic relief\" which is just stupid and unnecessary. A bit more adult sprinkled on this movie and it would be a lot better in my eyes. Still, a good movie! The end is near!; 'The end is near' was my best thought after an hour of Jumanji. The end of the movie that is. Despite a lot of good reviews of people I hardly know, this film is a first-class let-down. It is the somanieth movie in which Robin Williams comic qualities are abused. The story is about a game, Jumanji, that has come to life. After every move something terrible happens; a stampede or a giant spider attack. The game has to be finished to stop all terrible things happening. Of course Williams' comic talent and the special effects try to safe the movie but everything is overdone. By memory, I recall that the makers promised great special effects; they had used the same effects as Jurassic Park! Yes, they did, but they obviously only got the demo version of the package. Also, poor Kirsten Dunst, having the role of a nice young girl, is transformed is such a prig that all her good intentions fall into nothing. All in all, if you have to choose between watching this movie and cleaning up the house, please clean up your house starting with trashing the video of this movie. Good for children; beautiful film. As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is \"better\" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. A dark, mysterious, and entertaining childhood favorite of mine; Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good. review for jumanji.; This 1995 film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game 26 years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are 8+ as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than 8 and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark The jungle; This is an excellent movie for all ages. Congratulations to the cast, production, stunts and all the people. And now I want know what's happen in the jungle when Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) was there for 26 years. This should be a good adventure. Wish they had more Jumanji history; My only real complaint with Jumanji is where did this game come from? Who created it? I really wish they could have discovered more about the game's past, it's history. Then it would have made a little more sense. But I'm not saying I didn't like it. On the contrary, I do enjoy it very much, I think it's a cool buried treasure. The characters, the story, the effects all perfect. The cast does a great job in this movie and the concept of a strange magical board game works. I wish there was more monster animals. But the man eating plant and the giant spiders is enough to put it on my page. Robin Williams does great in this first monster movie, wish he do more. But that's just me. Anyway, in conclusion ladies and jelly spoons. This is an assume movie and you can do much worse then Jumanji. 8 STARS. An awesome movie...; This movie is great. The story is so interesting and unique. The cast do a great job of portraying their characters and the visual effects aren't bad for the mid-ninties. Some people say they don't like this movie, for whatever reason, but I think it's an enjoyable adventure that anyone would enjoy. This movie is about a board game. A very special board game. When two children play the game, everything that the their players do, happens to them. So when Alan's piece gets a card saying he has to wait in the jungle, he disappears, which nearly drives the young girl he was playing with mad. Twenty-six years later, two new kids play the game, and release Alan. Alan and the kids must get the other play to continue to game, otherwise they won't be free until it's completed. Best part of the movie: When Alan comes out of the game. Worst part of the movie: The spiders. Recommended for: Everyone. Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Amazing. Decent family entertainment; On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children. Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it. Fun little movie hidden in the back drawer; Movie plays. In comes zoo. Who's that laughing? Why it's you! Jumanji never made a big splash (though the PR engine tried its best) but it's a clever little fantasy about a magical board game that changes reality. The special effects are laughable and enjoyable at the same time, particularly the stampede, and altogether it's a fun jaunt. Surprisingly, considering that the rest of cast is mostly up-and-comers, Robin Williams doesn't dominate the film, but adds the right touch of insanity to the whole affair. But, like many Williams vehicles, there's a heavy \"let children be children\" component, as well as a domineering father figure who somehow just can't show his love for his child. Ignore all that, and just enjoy the game. 7 of 10 from me. The Disney movie that could have been; Hunt and Williams play the parts of shellshocked-delayed stress syndrome surviviors quite well. The story is entertaining and engrossing, with both elements of light and darkness. The effects-well, they DO look a bit unreal-and perhaps that is for the best-it adds a sense of unreality to the story -after all, these things come from a board-game universe! Even Van Pelt looks a bit CGI...and Bebe Nuewerth is a sweetie. An entertaining adventure movie; The thing that grabs people about this movie is the computer effects. They are supposed to be of a very high quality and very realistic. I must digress at this point because when I saw this movie recently I discovered that the effects were not as great as they are made out to be. In fact, the lion looked quite out of proportion and the monkeys looked quite fake. I think that they pushed themselves to a point where they could not do any better. Even though some of the effects were quite irritating, I did enjoy Jumanji. It is an adventure movie with everything, a stampede, deadly insects, lions, floods, earthquakes, and even a psychotic hunter with a very big gun. What makes this adventure movie different is that it is not set in the middle of Africa but rather in a quiet New England town, that is quiet until all of these things are unleashed upon it. The film begins in 1969 where little Alan Parrish is running away from bullies. He goes to his father's factory and notices a chest in one of the construction sites. Opening the chest he finds the game Jumanji. He takes it back home and plays it with his friend at which he promptly disappears. Fifteen years later, another two children find the game and decide to play it and release poor Alan Parrish. Having done that they realise that they must finished the game and revert everything back to normal. The interesting thing that I see in this movie is the difference in the time between 1969 and 1995. In 1969 everything is nice and everybody is friendly, with the exception of the bullies. Business is booming and the town is lovely and clean. This changes in 1995 for when Alan walks through the town we see a very different place. The once clean town park is now a squat for beggars, most of the shops have closed down and the Parish Shoe company has been abandoned. Alan Parrish spends 16 years in a jungle to emerge in a world that has completely changed. As is typical of Hollywood, everything reverts back to its original form at the end, which deludes us with the idea that we can return the world to the good old days. This is something that we cannot do. The pleasant memories of our past will always remain there, and as is seen in Jumaji, not everything about the past is all that pleasant. We can look forward to a time when everything is restored, but this restoration goes back to the time of the Garden of Eden. The perfect world of Eden will be restored, rather than our pleasant childhood memories. I still like this movie though. Robin Williams is not one of my most favourite actors, but he does not turn me off as actors such as Van Damme do. Rather, he is reasonable. It is not him that attracts me to the movie, but rather the story. The story is an adventure and it is what you get. Jumaji basically delivers what it promises. Very enjoyable fantasy adventure.; Jumanji starts in 1969 in New Hampshire in New England where a young boy named Alan Parish (Adam Hann-Byrdd) & his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) starts playing a strange board game called Jumaji that Alan found buried in the ground earlier, Jumanji turns out to be magical & Alan is sucked into the board game while Sarah runs off. Twenty six years later & it's 1995 & Alan's old house has been empty for years until now, until young brother & sister Judy (Kirsten Dunst) & Peter (Bradley Pierce) move in with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), the two youngsters find the Jumanji game & start playing it themselves as all manner of creatures & climate events begin to appear as does Alan (Robin Williams) who has spent the last twenty six years trapped inside Jumanji & is now an adult. The only way to reverse the effects of Jumanji is to finish the game so with a now adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) the four players must battle whatever Jumanji throw's at them including Lions, Monsoon's, giant Spider's & a stampede... Girected by former special effects man Joe Johnston this oddball fantasy adventure is actually pretty good but there are one or two things that ultimately drag it down to merely a very good film rather than a great film in my opinion. Based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsberg the film is apparently quite different & the two main character's here Alan & Sarah don't even appear in the book, Jumanji is a hard film to categorise as it mixes various ideas & themes like a bad childhood, finding redemption, standing up to your fears, fantasy, sci-fi, horror & comedy. At 100 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace, once it gets going the situation just keeps getting worse & worse as all the chaos & mayhem escalates beyond anyone's control with all sorts of animals running around & the theme of facing your fears is an ever present one. I am not sure there is another film quite like Jumanji & to find something so original & different in a mainstream film is unusual but the CGI effects scenes, the lack of character depth, the refusal to do anything with the plot other than destroy a house & an ultra happy ending which goes on forever that gives every character in the film the best most happy ending is pure Hollywood that was not needed & a slightly darker ending in keeping with the slightly darker tone of the film overall would have been much better. To be honest apart from great set-pieces & the basic concept there's really not that much to Jumanji at all, it's rather shallow & it's attempts at depth are pure heavy handed Hollywood cliché but it's fun & very entertaining while it lasts, just a shame about the last ten minutes really. Jumanji was made just as the CGI computer graphic revolution was taking off back in the mid 90's but the effects do hold up rather well actually, from huge plants to an impressive stampede of Rhino's & Elephant's through a house to a huge Lion with the mischievous Monkey's probably the only real weak effect. As a fairly light hearted fantasy adventure with some darker overtones there's a few amusing moments including a bemused policeman who's car is slowly & systematically trashed & as a whole the film delights in needless destruction & mayhem which is no bad thing. There are some laughs & a few scares as well & I could definitely see Jumanji appealing to both older & younger audiences. With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 this had a very healthy amount spent on it with most going towards the effects I would have thought. Filmed in New Hampshire & British Columbia in Canada. Despite being known as a manic performer Robin Williams is pretty restrained here & his brand of psychical comedy isn't used much, Kirsten Dunst is one of the few child stars to go on & have a successful adult career while the acting generally is pretty good. Jumanji is a unique fantasy adventure that I think would appeal to both children & adults, my only real problem is the sweeter than sweet happier than happy ending which is pure sentimental Hollywood at it's worst. With an ending more in keeping with the rest of the film Jumanji might have got a seven from but as it is it gets a six, good but not great. Followed by Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005) which was shot under the title Jumanji 2. Jumanji; I think that kids would like this movie better then grownups. I loved this movie but my mom thinks the plot is to low. The movie is based on the book Jumanji and is a lot more deeper then the book. My bother thought that the movie was corny and the special effects were so bad they were funny but what does he know? OK maybe the effects were bad but whatever. I mean the movie was made along time ago so give them a break. I thought the movie was really good and the acting was great. Its the kind of movie that if you like it you watch it again and again and again. When I was sick I saw it 4 times and I still thought it was good. All and all I would give this movie a 9. I think that kids would like to see it. One word - fun! **mild spoilers**; B   \"Jumanji\" is, simply put, a fun, family-oriented action/adventure film.  From the killer plants to the CGI stampede and monkeys, to character actor Jonathan Hyde's (\"The Mummy\", \"Titanic\", \"Anaconda\") dual role as Alan Parrish's (Adam Hann-Bird/Robin Williams) father, and the ruthless man hunter Van Pelt, this is a gung-ho \"Indiana Jones\"-type film for kids. The plot is basically two sets of kids who discover a board game that makes the events that occur in them (killer mosquitoes, monkeys, etc.) come true.  Robin Williams plays Alan Parrish, a boy who got trapped in the game as a kid, with Bonnie Hunt as the girl who was with him and later, his love interest.  Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce play the two kids from 1995. I'll take my previous statement back - the film is more slapstick than \"Indiana Jones\".  A lot of the humor is physical or sight gags - eg. the monkeys riding a motorcycle with a pistol, which IS pretty damn funny, and the rows of supplies knocking over paint cans that bury Van Pelt. The film is suspenseful, well-produced, and has good special effects.  No, I'll take it back.  The monkeys and the lion look really fake (the stampede works since it would be hard to film a real one), but otherwise, they're okay. Aside from the fake-looking animals and the way-too-drawn-out ending, \"Jumanji\" is superb. Seven stars. Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a 10/10. Jumanji is fun!; What a great movie and a clever concept! A board game that sucks you into it, and must be finished by the originals who played the game. I remember seeing Jumanji in the movie theatre when it first came out, and this past weekend had the opportunity to rewatch it (thank you resale DVDs!) Starring Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, the action is fast paced and easy to follow. No swearing in this movie makes it appropriate for all ages, though little ones might be frightened by the rampaging animals. There is nothing Disneylike in their qualities. Still, the story of sticking together and teamwork prevail throughout the entire film. Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Greier are great in their supporting roles. Bonnie Hunt gets some of the best lines in the film with regards to cheating and a downtown sale. An early Kirstin Dunst is also great. If you have never seen Jumanji, I encourage you check it out. It's fun and you always wonder what the game is going to come up with next. LOVE THIS MOVIE!; Last night, May 2,2003  this movie was on again........no matter what other show we might be browsing at the time, we invariably start watching Jumanji,,,,,,we enjoy the hilarity and antics of all the characters,  it's done for shear  fun and entertainment, and we don't care if the special effects may be outdated,  we still consider it one of the best! So there! :-) Two  Happy Fishes  from oHIo Early CGI Makes the Monkeys Look Fake! Otherwise It's Amazing!; An enchanted board game breaks into the real world and the only way out of it is to finish the game! The monkeys look \"washed-out\" and so do some of the wild zoo animals; which is why most of the rest of the EFX are mechanical or use backdrops and mattes. Otherwise a very strong 10 would be my vote, as the casting works and the plot shows lots of imagination and flair. With a \"sly wink\" to \"Peter Pan\", Alan's father plays both his dad and Van Pelt the Hunter. My two favorite scenes are when the house gets folded in half and eaten by the monstrous plant, and when everything swirls backwards into the gameboard. I also love it when the house goes \"wild\" and turns into a swamp complete with nasty alligators. I do not like the scene where the little boy turns into a monkey with a tail. Young children may find it disturbing like the donkey transformation in \"Pinocchio\". \"Jumanji\" is suspenseful and scary but no one actually dies in the film. Therefore, it's much more enjoyable when viewed again. The only one who seemed to hate it was Roger Ebert, but it's only too scary for pre-schoolers. Most \"users\" love it! What \"scares\" me the most in this film: the bats, insects, spiders, alligators, and The Hunter. The sequel will not have the charisma of the late and great Robin Williams. I still miss him. He was a comic genius. If there was a market for it, I would like it to be re-imagined with better graphics like the old \"Star Trek TOS\" reissue. Entertaining family/adventure/fantasy; Released in 1995, \"Jumanji\" is fun movie about a mystical board game from the 1800s, which is found in 1969 leading to the mysterious disappearance of a rich boy. The game is discovered again in 1995 by two orphans (Jonathan Hyde and Kirsten Dunst) who play the game and bring back the lost boy now an adult (Robin Williams). The only way they can stop the havoc the game causes is to finish it. Bonnie Hunt, David Alan Grier and Bebe Neuwirth are also on hand. Patricia Clarkson has a small role. \"Jumanji\" is a great example of the way youth adventures should be done. It's entertaining from beginning to end for children, teens and adults. If you've lost sight of your inner-kid give \"Jumanji\" a try. What makes it worthwhile for adults, besides simply being fun, is that it contains compelling themes and everything ties-up for a moving climax. Plus Bebe Neuwrith looks great (she played Frasier's psychologist babe on Cheers). The movie runs 104 minutes and was shot in Maine, New Hampshire and the Vancouver, British Columbia, area. GRADE: B+ Imaginative (spoiler); This is probably one of the most imaginative movies I have seen in a while. I mean, it has an entire back story, as we can see in the beginning, when those two kids are trying to get rid of the game. Then it goes to 1969, when Alan finds the game, he and Sarah start playing, and he gets sucked into Jumanji. Then, throughout the rest of the movie, Alan comes out of the jungle and he, Sarah, Judy, and Peter continue playing the game and unleashing all these dangerous animals (and Van Pelt) and the monsoon and killer plants into the city. And at the end, those kids in Japan find the game. Very well thought out. Certainly worth a look. Fun!; I give this movie a ten on ten. I may be biased as I watched this movie when I was ten and whenever I watch it, it brings back fond memories of lazing around and watching movies during my summer vacations. But I am surprised that the overall rating for this movie is 6.5 (when I write this review), I expected it to be at least 7. This really is a fun movie to watch with some hilarious scenes. The monkey bike riding scene stands out it particular. The special effects looked good when I was young but now the fake animals are not very impressive. Jurassic Park was made before this movie and had much better special effects. Robin Williams does seem too old to play a 35 year old Alan Parish but he is a brilliant actor and you do not mind accepting him as Alan. Bonnie Hunt does a good job too as the paranoid Sarah Whittle. The kids do a great job too, especially Bradley Pierce; look out for the scene where he is searching for an axe. And David Grier is brilliant as the bumbling sheriff Carl Bentley. I suggest you watch this movie with your family on a weekend. Its worth it! My first crush on  Kirstin Dunst...; When this movie came out during the holiday season in 1995, I enjoyed it very much seeing it in SDDS and 35mm at the Sony in Wayne with my family and loved the effects. I even had the VHS for awhile. This is a good movie to test your surround sound system to the limits. The book was good, and the movie is better, but the TV show sucked. With the upcoming reboot replacing the board game with a video game coming out later this year, it's time to revisit this legendary Robin Williams family classic for the first time. An entertaining family film.; This film talks about a board game set in the inhospitable jungles of Indonesia that recreates magically the dangers in the board, for horror of the players involved. Directed by Joe Johnston, the film has a script by a team led by Jonathan Hensleigh. The main protagonist is Robin Williams, assisted by the young Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Yes, the theme of the movie would make a great horror film but, in this case, we have a comedy. And Robin Williams was definitely the \"Mr. comedy\". Any comic role fit him like a glove and this film was no exception. Although his character have some psychological depth, because of the trauma of being alone in the jungle for decades, it only serves to accentuate the humorous slant of what he says and does. The script is interesting, simple and very imaginative. The story works, entertains and holds the audience. The film scares a bit in certain scenes, but never in an excessive dose for children. The scenarios are good and the special, visual and sound effects are excellent. Some creatures in the film are clearly false and have a funny look. The soundtrack is regular, not bringing surprises, but doing their part without blemish. This film was made to entertain the audience, in particular the families, and does it very well.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                OLDER, HORNIER AND STILL FRUSTRATED IN MINNESOTA;  `Grumpier Old Men' is a film that is a sequel to `Grumpy Old Men.' Reprising their original roles are Jack Lemmon as John Gustafson, Walter Matthau as Max Goldman, Ann Margaret as Ariel, Burgess Meredith as John's father, Kevin Pollock and Darryl Hannah as the children of Max and John. They are still next-door neighbors, only now the feud has subsided. Their children are living across the street in Ariel's house.  The marriage of their children is on the horizon. The setting for this film is summer and fall in Minnesota.  Fishing is still the main sport where `Catfish Hunter' is still the elusive prize.  The bait shop on the lake has been closed since Chuck passed away.  It is now under new management.  John and Max are anxiously waiting the reopening.  To their surprise, it is not being reopened as a bait shop, but a ristorante (restaurant).  Here enters Sophia Loren as the new proprietress Maria Sophia Calotti Ragetti.  Ann Guilbert who plays her mother joins her.  When Max and John find out the new plans for their favorite bait shop, they set out to undermine her plans for a grand opening.  A series of misunderstandings set off a domino effect that touches everyone's lives.  New loves are found and an old feud is rekindled. All of the same emotions that were in the previous film are in this film. There is laughter, sadness, anger and happiness.  Catfish Hunter makes his film debut, which, in essence, puts a `face' with a name.  His film appearance pays credence to the fact that he is a `real' fish and not just a myth.   The acting in this film is superb both by human and non-human.  Cute sequel that works; Fun story of two older men who never quite outgrew boyhood, and the ladies they love. What a treat to see two master actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, working with silly material and enjoying every minute of it. The lady loves, Ann Margret and the ever-sexy and dazzling Sophia Loren, do equally well with a lightweight, sometimes over-the-top script. The principals are aided by a uniformly fine supporting cast, including Burgess Meredith as the Lemmon character's outrageously lecherous dad, and Ann Morgan Guilbert as Sophia's feisty mama. The older players' interaction is a delight. My only quibble with this film is the fact that Meredith's character dies without getting married like everyone else. Why? I wondered whether Meredith had perhaps expired during filming, but, according to Wikipedia, the actor lived a whole two years following this movie's release! The original film, \"Grumpy Old Men,\" takes place during a picturesque Minnesota winter, with snow used to charming effect. The follow-up capitalizes on a Midwestern summer. Like apples and oranges, both productions satisfy. More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in 1995, 2 years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie 8 out of 10. A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances...; A sequel to the thoroughly enjoyable Grumpy Old Men, 'Grumpier Old Men' is A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances. The sequel has the spirit of its prequel & the amazing cast, led by the impeccable talents of the Late/Great Jack Lemmon & the Late/Great Walter Matthau, are in full form! 'Grumpier Old Men' Synopsis: John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. 'Grumpier Old Men' works well as a romantic-comedy, as it has moments of humour & subtle romance. I loved the prequel & I must say, the sequel doesn't fail to deliver. The film has sustained its energy & wit, that one would expect from it. Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is entertaining, although initially the pace is slightly slow. Howard Deutch's Direction is top-class. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is good. Editing also is ably done. Performance-Wise: Lemmon & Matthau shine all through. Its their sheer on-screen chemistry, that alone is worth watching the entire film. Sophia Loren is top-notch. Ann-Margret is impressive. Kevin Pollak & Daryl Hannah leave a mark. Late/Great Burgess Meredith is memorable in his part. On the whole, 'Grumpier Old Men' is a smooth, relaxing watch. Oh, How The Mighty Have Fallen...; GRUMPY OLD MEN (3 outta 5 stars) GRUMPIER OLD MEN (2 outta 5 stars) I dunno why I even bothered to watch the second one. Oh, I guess because it was on cable TV shown as a double bill with the original \"Grumpy Old Men\". I liked the original when I first saw it. It was not the best work by the Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau team... but it had its moments... these two actors could probably read pages from the phone book to each other and still make it funny. Unfortunately, the sequel has even FEWER of those moments. Still, I maintain that no movie with either Lemmon OR Matthau in it can be *totally* worthless. This is probably as close as they ever got, though. (Bear in mind that I have not yet seen their last movie together, \"The Odd Couple II\".) Practically the same plot as the first movie... Lemmon and Matthau play lifelong acquaintances and next door neighbors who are constantly bickering about fish and/or women. Burgess Meredith plays Lemmon's FATHER... and if you find old people talking dirty hilarious then you'll probably love his scenes (especially in the closing credits outtakes). Ann Margaret and Sophia Loren play the women in the grumpy guys' lives... hard to imagine that women as attractive as they still are would want anything to do with these two old dorks but, hey... I guess pickings are slim after 65. very funny.; This film has some of the funniest lines and it's a great comedy. One would probably think, even I, thought that this would probably happen between two older men who fight about the obvious: women, fish and each other. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are a perfect pair. Even though it's a comedy, the romance in it is on the clean side. Nothing too distasteful and the comic relief is still included into the romance, which gives it a continuous comic flow. Even though there is a serious part of the film where John's father passes away, after that scene the film is back to the comic feel, which is nice because there's no dwelling on the sad/serious scene. Nonetheless, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh hard. Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Snoozing sequel with the leads in need of some No-Doz; Woeful, disappointing sequel to 1993's hit \"Grumpy Old Men\" is more retread than follow-up. The two crotchety neighbors--Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--bicker over their children (who will soon be making the sparring oldsters in-laws!) and, of course, who has the better fishing skills. They stop trading insults long enough for Matthau to begin irritating a new woman in town, a fiery Italian who has just opened her own restaurant. Sitcom humor with a sometimes-raunchy twist that is no longer fresh. Almost worth-seeing for Sophia Loren's funny, lively performance, but everyone else looks a little sleepy. Ann-Margret (who married Lemmon's character at the end of the original) must've dropped in for a day and a half to complete her work. As the youthful couple, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah are also under-used. ** from **** The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Back For More!; CONTAINS SPOILERS John Gustafson and Max Goldman are back in their first adventure since their last. It's six months later and they're still fishing. All the snow has melted and the neighborhood looks very different. The boys are out to catch a giant legendary fish they've heard tell about.          These men would soon discover big changes happening. Like, their friend Chuck, who died in the last adventure, had operated the bait shop. Ever since his demise, it's been empty, but some people have come with plans to turn it into a ristorante (restaurant). They are: Mama Regetti and daughter Maria. John and Max don't want that to happen so they pull numerous pranks on the Regettis but they still won't leave.         Jacob Goldman and Melanie Gustafson contemplate matrimony. But have their doubts when their fathers insist on planning the event. But when the kids decide the wedding is off, John and Max are back at it. Pulling all sorts of foolish pranks on one another. Max steals John's outboard motor, John wrecks Max's fish net and has his cat scratch up Max's car seats, but Max sends a big dog through John's house. Ariel decides to leave for a while. John was in a real pickle. He tried asking his father for advice, but he had passed away; Max goes on a date with Maria and they decide they like one another.        Pretty soon, it's a wedding day. En route to the church, Max and John decide to fish for the giant musket they're so fond of. They catch it, but John says they must leave it in the lake out of respect for his father, so they do and rush to church. It looks like the wedding of Jacob and Melanie, but it isn't. They eloped. It's the wedding of Max and Maria. John planted Max's dog in the limo as they drive off.        Was this as good as the first? Sure. I'm sorry to say that the three main stars, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith are no longer with us. Meredith died in 1998, Matthau in 2000 and Lemmon in 2001, which is real sad. So it's guarenteed there will never be an Even Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple III. They were really funny men. Why do the good ones always gotta die? But anyway, if you're a fan of these men and you enjoyed the first one, then I recommend Grumpier Old Men! - Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. 7/10 stars. 1/10; this movie sucked! I hate it! It's so boring! The acting is so bad! Why does Sophia Loren's italian character talk english to her italian mother when they're alone? The script is so bad! It's so corny! Max and John fighting with the fishing things is so silly! This movie was never funny! It was painful to watch, i'm telling you! Avoid it! Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT 7 out of 10 Delightful acting and script but silly scenes...; Always delighting in Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, warmed by their aging and childish pranks, I enjoyed this film which is filled with delightful acting and fun script.It suffers, however,  from more than a few silly scenes. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10 A sequel that's equal to the original comedy; The first go round was such a hit, that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau got together for this sequel to the 1993 smash hit, \"Grumpy Old Men.\" And \"Grumpier Old Men\" is every bit as good as the first film. It has some new characters and the scene changes from winter to summer, then winter and spring. Most reviewers don't talk about the surprise of the wedding in the first film. And I won't do that for that film or this one. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) team up for a time in the movie to plan the wedding of their daughter and son, Melanie and Jacob (played by Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak). And, later, to try to thwart the conversion of their bait shop into an Italian restaurant. Sophia Loren is the added ingredient for much humor as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti. She's a cousin of \"Spaghetti\" Ragetti, whom John and Max know. Her mother is in the picture, Mama Ragetti, played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. And, grandpa Gustafson is back, with Burgess Meredith now a couple years older. He tells son, John, as they sit by the lake drinking beer, that he sometimes thinks God has forgotten about him. The hijinks and capers in this film include some hilarious pranks the two friendly enemies pull on the Ragettis. As with the original film, this one supposedly takes place in Wabasha, Minnesota. While it is a real town on the Mississippi River border with Wisconsin, the filming for this and the earlier movie was done in a number of places around that area of southeastern Minnesota. So, anyone going to Wabasha won't find the fishing lake, the town overlook or some other scenes shown in these films. With the 10 films they made together  especially the nine comedies, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have delighted audiences for decades. May they outlive Catfish Hunter and continue amuse people for decades to come. Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5. Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Loren is still hot; Grumpy old men was an OK comedy with a nice performance by Ann-Margret, but otherwise forgettable. This film, on the other hand, has some real comic touches that actually also have something to say about the aging process - and life really doesn't end until it ends. But first the bad news: Daryl Hannah. I've liked her in other films, but she is so flat in this, she's a distraction. She doesn't have the feel for these characters, not even her own, and so doesn't quite fit. She's not even credible as the mother of the young girl who is so important in her relationship to great=grand-dad Burgess Meredith. There must have been some plot device they could have come up with to leave her out of the picture altogether; oh, well. Now the really good news: Sophia Loren. I admit I have always had a crush on her since I saw Houseboat as a kid; and when I saw the shower scene in Arabesque, i couldn't sleep for a week. Her performance here is splendid (romantic comedy is one of her strengths, after all), but the really really good news is that she was past sixty when she made this film, and she looks hot enough to burn a young man's fingers! Really - if I'd been Walter Matthau in that bar scene, I'd have gone out with a heart-attack right there - and smiling. With an adequate script, and such superb actors, Deutsch wisely lets the formula roll on without interference. Consequently, whatever the short-comings there's plenty to remember fondly from this film. Oh, and don't miss the blooper-reel that runs under the final credits - Matthau and Meredith are having a grand old time. Oh, and Sophia Loren is still hot. A vibrant sequel that's still underwhelming; I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They seem to work perfectly together, and with a better script, this movie could be gold. We are taken back to Minnesota to re-visit the old grumps who now have to plan a wedding for their very plain and very boring children. There's a reason Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah have never had substantial film careers- they're very uninteresting actors. But I digress. If \"Grumpy Old Men\" built up it's laughs, \"Grumpier Old Men\" topples them down. The best moments of both films are when Lemmon and Matthau trade vicious insults at one another, and also play pranks on each other. But when this is taken away, we're suffering every old cliché in the book, including Walter's tiresome 'Wholey Moley' line which is used so much, it could be taken into context for a Shot Party (take a shot every time Matthau 'Wholey Moley''s himself). The other problem with this series is the fact that gorgeous women fall for these two farts. Roger Ebert made a very valid point in his review for this film- first Ann-Margaret moves into the neighborhood and marries Jack Lemmon. Now the even more gorgeous Sophia Loren has set her sights on the incredibly unattractive Matthau. And why? For concepts in the plot. There's no reason a woman as beautiful and intelligent as Loren would fall for the dull and disgusting figure Matthau is. I know this is a comedy, but come on now! All in all this sequel is peppier and a little more fun then the original, but both movies suffer from overblown dramatic passages that are not needed. We want to see the old guys go at it, not Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah. I laughed a lot at this movie- mostly at the incredibly underrated Bergis Meredith as the foul-mouthed Grandpa. Since all three main actors have passed, we'll never see them again. At least Margaret and Loren are still alive and kicking. I'd love to see their movie: \"Grumpy Old Widows\". Still having a good ol' time!; I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men back to back, so I could see both instead of my normal rent one sequel at a time ordeal. I just finished Grumpier Old Men this morning and was expecting a modest sequel, but it turned into a great sequel, pretty much to the point where I enjoyed Grumpier Old Men to Grumpy Old Men. Despite the fact that they use some old jokes, this was a fun plot and I thought the guys have gotten even funnier, including John's father, he's a little dirty, but so much fun to laugh at. John and Max are now best friends again and couldn't be happier with each other, their son and daughter are about to get hitched, and they are overwhelming with the wedding plans. Max is starting to get lonely though, since Chuck has passed on, the bait shop is given to two older Italian women, one lady, Maria, starts a little feud with Max wanting to turn the bait shop into a restaurant. But their anger turns into a hidden passion and they end up falling head over heals for each other, but Maria has some hidden skeletons in her closet. Grumpier Old Men is proof that you are never too old to fall in love or have your heart broken again. It was so sweet seeing Max fall in love with Maria, I loved their passion for each other, it was so fun to watch. John's father and Maria's mother were just so awesome and funny, they had such great chemistry! I would highly recommend Grumpier Old Men, it's a great comedy that once again touches your heart and tickles your funny bone. 8/10 It has it's moments; Howard Deutch decided he wanted to cash in on the success of Grumpy Old Men and it worked. The only problem to the sequel is that some of the cast seem to be a bit bored by the proceedings. The one liners are enough to make you drop your popcorn. Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon are a joy to watch as they continue to find ways to drive each other over the edge into insanity. And yet Deutch calms that insanity by giving us a quick glimpse into just how much these two men mean to each other when Jack's dad played by Burgess Meredith dies. Lemmon and Mathau are still at the top of their game in this film. In this film the Ann Margaret character is suppose to be the rock, the sound of reason, the calm in the midst of the storm. You believe she is until she has the insanity thrust upon her and is forced to react. For the most part Ann Margaret as well as Daryl Hannah seem bored throughout the entire film. Kevin Pollack is just as good in this sequel as in the original. Burgess Meredith is the scene stealer, he manages with dead pan accuracy to deliver some of the best one liners in the film. Ann Morgan Guilbert manages to match Burgess with her ability to respond to his one liners with shock and outrage befitting her character. And then you come to Sophia. Sophia is in her comfort zone here. Sophia is comfortable with the slapstick comedy and relishes it, she's in the movie, she's not walking through it. She's absolutely stunning to watch but at the same time she adds to the moment. She's as glamorous as ever but it doesn't get in the way. All in all a good follow up to the original. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. charming and funny light romantic comedy; It may be just me but I found Grumpier Old Men way way better than Grumpy Old Men. I laughed more and got involved in the plot much more. That it is totally 100% predictable every step of the way is only one of its charms... its how you get there where the fun is. And these actors turn in surprisingly memorable performances for such a slight film. I thought Sophia Loren turned in one of her most charming and funny performances, as did everyone else. The story was just more interesting and three dimensional than the first film and flowed more organically. The story line is simple ancient classic romantic comedy that these veterans had done so many times, it seemed for them like doing a well-known dance. The fun is not in surprises but in going through the old steps with joy. The actors move through their paces with simplicity and enthusiasm and the film actually captures very well the effects of love. The whole film hangs together and works in a way that, for me, the first one didn't. It gets airborne. It deserves a higher ranking than my seven except the story is a little too well-worn. It also allows the two protagonists to get a little more real with each other. Even the three charismatic animal actors get caught up in the spirit of fun. One thing about the film that gave me trouble was that all four women being courted in the film are talented, accomplished, strong and magnificent while all four of the men are hamstrung. I found it mysterious that these women, dropped by some miracle into this tiny town, would be so strongly attracted. funny funny; I, too, found the film very funny and until reading about it here couldn't remember who played the other woman with Burgess Meredith at the end of the film, the scene that made the whole film complete.  Without giving away what happened at the end of the film, the other woman was that gorgeous elder lady of many great films - Sophia Loren.  What a delicious surprise!  Good also for any old grumpy man! the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... not much fun; Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still combative while maintaining their truce. John is married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) now and his father (Burgess Meredith) is still spry. Everybody is chasing after the big fish Catfish Hunter. Meanwhile, their children Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are planning to get married. Newcomer Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in Wabasha to buy the bait shop and turn it into an Italian restaurant. It's a continuation that's missing much of the fun. It is contrived. It's great to see these great actors working together but that's all I got out of it. I found very few laughs. after you have seen the first there is no point seeing this one; After the fun of watching Lemmon and Matthau act like kids for less than 2 hours (i.e. from the first movie) I was satisfied, but then due to the success of the first movie the producers decided to give it another twirl, this time the story had the two starting off as friends thanks to the incidents that happened in the ending of the first film, but then some really really idiotic stupid reason, they were at it again. The movie was not funny as it was like a replay of the first, same pranks, similar plot and screenplay made this movie a waste of time. After getting a mate for John, they (the producers) decided to get a mate for Max, with nothing to write home about but a lame script that just showed no finesse or true plan, just the producers hoping to bank on the success of the previous movie. The main disappointment in the movie for me was Sophia Loren; her acting was just too weak for me to understand that she is a star. Everybody else in the movie even Burgess Meredith (who had Alzheimer's disease and this was his last motion picture appearance) was impressive, at least that I can give them. The movie is directed this time by Howard Deutch, who later worked with the duo in 1998 for Odd Couple II, Deutch other movies also have not been well received like Getting Even with Dad (1994) and The Whole Ten Yards (2004), which are basically the reason why I will not bother seeing My Best Friend's Girl. The movie plot carries on 6 months after the incidents of the first, where both John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) were getting prepared for the wedding of their children. Then a new arrival in town a beautiful lady by the name of Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) came in to change things by turning the towns bait shop to a restaurant. John and Max join forces to try and run the new lady out of town, but the issues between John and Max's children marriage plan caused both to reignite their feud as both refused to believe that their child was at fault. Only the ladies are alive till today (February 2013), as both Lemmon and Matthau died like half a decade after this movie release. Grumpier Old Men was a box office success in its own part, but a huge critical disappointment, as the movie cost 10 million dollars less than its predecessor and made like a million more in the box office. After you have seen the first there is basically no point why you should bother seeing this one, because it will stand in my mind as one movie I credit as a waste of time and talent. www.lagsreviews.com Funnier than the first!; This movie is downright hilarious with tons of good one-liners. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (may they both rest in peace) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max & John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says \"Holy moly\" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor! As Good As The Original; Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\". I don't agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love \"Buddy Buddy\" and \"The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile. Pretty Dang Funny; John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. We often expect sequels to be weaker than the original. But sometimes we may be pleasantly surprised. In this sequel, the \"grumpy old men\" are still up to their old tricks, going after each other and teaming up to close down a restaurant. Some of it may be a bit far-fetched (in real life, a store owner would get the cops involved) but it's good fun. Sadly, the film has the distinction of being Burgess Meredith's final film. On the plus side, he really goes out with a bang. His acting and delivery of witty lines is top notch, and the film does a great job of hiding his Alzheimer's. You can really feel the talent in his character. Grumpy, but not funny; What, I wonder, does the legendary Billy Wilder think of this film starring Lemmon and Matthau, the great team he so memorably paired in 1966's \"The Fortune Cookie\"?  Wilder's film is a dark, cynical satire, and was the first of what is now seven films starring the pair.  Seven films, but only two of them--\"The Fortune Cookie\" and \"The Odd Couple\"--are genuinely funny efforts showcasing these actors' combined talents.  \"Grumpy Old Men\" was mildly amusing due less to the script than to the welcome return of Lemmon and Matthau who hadn't been on screen together in 12 years.  The unexpected box-office bonanza naturally inspired a sequel, but all this equally lucrative outing has in its favor is a brief monologue by Burgess Meredith who, as Lemmon's 95-year-old father, boasts of eating bacon and smoking Camels while the \"experts\" who warned against such vices are taking a \"dirt nap.\"  Not even Lemmon and Matthau can enliven the script by Mark Steven Johnson this time around.  The curmudgeonly Matthau admitted he didn't lke the script for the first film but did it to work with Lemmon, and that the only reason he did the sequel is because the first film was a hit.  No doubt, \"Grumpiest Old Men,\" the inevitable sequel, will be just as dreary. If these pictures make big bucks, why tamper with the formula?  Why hire Billy Wilder to punch up the quality when the public seems content merely to see Lemmon and Matthau rather than see them at their best? Is it better than original?; Is this movie better than the original? Perhaps. It's probably funnier than the original. Walter Matthau's pick-up line is one of the funniest things of the movie. But is it better than the original? The original had more of the emotions of Lemmon and Matthau as they fought. This one has less feuding (but still has some of the old pranks) and more focus on the family / dating relationships of the old men. This movie is funny and definitely worth watching. You'll have to decide on your own if it's better than the original. Mini Ha Has In Minnesota; It's just possible that the intention was to shoot four Grumpy Old Men titles featuring the four seasons because after the Winter setting of the first one we are now in Summer though theoretically such a cycle should have begun with Spring and ended with Winter so maybe the cyclical thing was an afterthought. Whatever we have virtually the same cast doing virtually the same thing with one absentee and two replacements one of which, Anna Guilbert is actually a native of Minneapolis adding a touch of authenticity. If it was unrealistic that Ann Margaret - who, after all, was teaching English at university and would by definition have access to dozens of eligible males - would marry Jack Lemmon in the first film it is equally unrealistic that Sophia Loren would wed Walter Mattheau here other than for feelgood reasons. On the other hand it's probably churlish to nitpick in this way when the film is only intended to entertain. Which it does. As equally funny as the original, but with an Italian flair!!!!; This sequel to Grumpy Old Men is as funny as the original. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and the rest of the cast from the original movie reprise their roles. John and Max are still feuding, but the tension between them has softened. There are, however, some changes: Ariel and John are married and there's a new girl in town named Maria Ragetti. She's moved to Wabasha to open up an Italian restaurant at the former Chuck's Bait place. When the boys discover what Maria's intentions are, they hatch a scheme to ruin the grand opening of the restaurant and try to keep Chuck's business going, even though the inventory of the former business has been cleared out and the interior remodeled to look like an Italian restaurant. Max and Sophia meet, but there's a disagreement about what the place should be. Maria goes to the neighborhood bar to try and reason with Max, but to no avail. It seems as though Max and John have trouble saying goodbye to what is no longer there. The humor between Lemmon and Matthau's characters is still spiced up and is still able to put viewers in stitches. Then, Max and Maria get married, and the restaurant starts selling bait, as well. Great movie, great cast, great fun!! Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. 2/5 stars - John Ulmer \"Good Lemmon & Matthau Comedy Sequel!\"; Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Kevin Pollack, Daryl Hannah and Burgess Meredith star in this 1995 comedy sequel. This takes place about 6 months later where John (Lemmon) is now married to Ariel (Margret) and he and Max (Matthau) are sort of getting along. This time, Max finds romance when he meets Maria Ragetti (Loren), an Italian widow who moves into town and opens a restaurant. Jacob (Pollack) and Melanie (Hannah) are also engaged and things start to get a bit difficult for them which makes their dads feud with each other, but only temporarily. The late, Meredith (Rocky) also returns as John's father and this was his final film. This is a good sequel and like the first film, it provides laughs and a bit of heartfelt moments as well. I recommend this. The good, the bad, and the just plain miserable...again; It's not uncommon for a movie sequel to do little to the formula that made its predecessor so financially (and hopefully critically) successful. The old \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" method of filmmaking has been used in the Hangover, Home Alone, and Taken franchise to only modest success in terms of quality. However, in Grumpier Old Men, the sequel to the fine comedy Grumpy Old Men, handles the rehashed formula better than many film sequels do. While I'm getting to sound repetitive and out of descriptive words, this is largely because of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's chemistry together on-screen. From the moment they appear, it's almost impossible to believe the men's friendship in real life wasn't lifelong and consisted largely of playful torment, vulgarity, and several boys nights out. Had the film been a sequel with few returning cast members (say Lemmon and Matthau were substituted by two other actors), this sequel would've likely been a somber affair to view. In a way, I'm thankful the town of Wabasha Minnesota hasn't really changed much since our last outing, with the exception of John Gustafson (Jack Lemon) marrying Ariel (Ann-Margret) from the original film. In the meantime, John's dad still lives off a diet of beer, cigarettes, and bacon and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), John's cantankerous neighbor, still finds himself engaging in petty neighborhood battles with John about outwitting the other man. However, the big ordeal this time is not competing for a new neighbor's love but trying to save a local bait shop from becoming a \"restaurante\" for Italian cuisine. The restaurant is managed by Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren), a gorgeous but uncompromisingly strict woman who catches the eye of Max even as him and Jack plan to foil the restaurant's forthcoming prosperity. Other events (aka subplots) occurring in Wabasha are the wedding between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah), a plot which would later be used by the same director Howard Deutch in The Odd Couple II, also starring Lemmon and Matthau, along with John trying to get his father (Burgess Meredith in his final role, which was burdened by spouts with Alzheimer's and difficultly remembering lines, some female company as he gets older. One of Grumpier Old Men's immediate issues is that there is simply too much going on between plot-strands that involve marriage/romance troubles (I counted four including John's brief trouble with Ariel later in the movie) ad others that involve trying to sabotage the bait-shop-turned-restaurant. Grumpier Old Men may have too many new ideas for cutesy subplots, but it keeps the tone and feel of its predecessor alive and well. It still feels like Wabasha is the location of a sitcom with its oddball situations that seem to consistently bear hefty consequences for its residents, but its characters still feel like real people we've come to known and care about. Unsurprisingly, Lemmon and Matthau share unbelievable conversational beauty in the way they engage in simple discussions that seem to constantly end in uproariously funny bickering. Once you minimize your focus on that aspect in the film, you have just an average comedy that, while charming and pleasantly safe (a good and bad quality for this particular kind of picture), is just grateful to be buoyed by two very talented leading men. Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Sophia Loren, and Burgess Meredith. Directed by: Howard Deutch. Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life & Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau & Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman & John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a 7.4 out of 10 Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. Grumpier Old Men (1995) **1/2; More of the same for those who enjoyed the first film, nothing great but a decent time killer. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return in their twilight years as the ever-battling duo, but this time with the added attraction of Sophia Loren who still looks gorgeous at age 60. She winds up posing a threat to their favorite bait and tackle shop when she decides to take it over and turn it into an Italian restaurant. Since Lemmon's already got sexy Ann-Margret as his hot girlfriend, Sophia hits it off with old man Matthau (ah, the magic of movies), who does not look as good for his age (75). Burgess Meredith is better used in this one in his role as Lemmon's naughty old pop. **1/2 out of **** Who would have ever guessed that it's the same place?; For the most part, \"Grumpier Old Men\" is pretty silly. Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still at each other's throats when Italian immigrant Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in town and throws everything into flux. What actually struck me most about the movie was how different the town looked in this one from the original. Obviously, it was a different time of year, but maybe the different look was meant to show how everything might be changing in the town. Other than that, Ann-Margret returns as Ariel, and she's still as free-spirited and vivacious as she was in the original. Burgess Meredith - in his final role - is still the grandfather who can exercise absolute authority over the youngsters, although he now has the hots for Maria's mother (Ann Morgan Guilbert, aka Millie on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\"). Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah also reprise their roles from the original...ah, and there's that fish. All in all, a fairly interesting movie. Not any kind of masterpiece, but it showed that Lemmon and Matthau still had it. Grumpier Old Men Too Sedate *; While Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were an excellent team, they bombed in this film but good. What's so grumpy about Lemmon in this film? The prequel was much better. Ann Guilbert, as Sophia Loren's mother, is given little to do. Remember her as the grandmother to \"The Nanny?\" Sophia Loren, other than marrying Matthau, is also give nothing to do. Ditto for Ann-Margret, Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak, all of whom were so good in the original but are reduced to practically nothing here. I also resent Matthau, who shows off his part-Jewish heritage marrying in a church at the end. I found this to be offensive. Sorry, but that's the way I am-old fashioned. To all those criticize me for the last statement, how would you have felt if the Matthau-Loren nuptials had taken place in a synagogue? While I realize that this was a comedy, this still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. A non-religious setting would have been the only solution to this. great; This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) Sweet and Sad; In this bright sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\" we find John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) at it again. The rivalry never stops. This time, they are bickering over their children's nuptials, almost causing a wedding not to occur. Sophia Loren co-stars as Maria in this foray into the land of 10,000 lakes as the new girl in town that Max has an eye for. At first, they both hate one another because she is turning his beloved tackle shop into a restaurant. Comedy ensues as Max and John both try to get the restaurant shut down and condemned. Eventually, as in the first film, love finds a way. However, sadness veils over as well when Burgess Meredith's character dies. Other than that, the film is very enjoyable. Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from 1995. The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe 8yrs old, and must have seen it over 100 x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it 15 minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. Great!; This is a rare sequel. Wait a minute, sequels aren't rare. Well, that's true, but a *good* sequel is rare. Most of the time, sequels aren't even in the same league as the originals. However, due to excellent writing, a superb cast and great direction, this film is every bit as enjoyable as Grumpy Old Men. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made several films together and they worked together extremely well. The gorgeous Ann Margaret reprises her role from the first film and is now Lemmon's wife. A new lady hits town and Matthau is very interested. This lovely creature is played by Sophia Loren, who is still stunningly beautiful. Burgess Meredith is great as Grandpa. The stellar cast ensures great acting. However, this film is also written such that there is literally a laugh nearly every minute. I found the film to be highly enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh. Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the 1st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. One of the best movies of 1995!; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter & Jack's previous films together. It was this film & the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max & John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down. forget the fussing; As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Good Laughs; Grumpier Old Men (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to Grumpy Old Men have Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau returning with more fights and foul language. This time out Lemmon is still happily married but Matthau is on the move and takes a special interest in an Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved to town. I think the most remarkable thing about this film is how well Loren looked. Even at 61 she's still a head turner and her comic timing isn't too bad either. I'm sure this film was only made because the first one made money but it doesn't really matter as no one should take this too serious as it's just a silly comedy meant to make you laugh. There are plenty of nice laughs here but I don't think it's as good as the original. This certainly isn't in the league as The Odd Couple but we do get a pretty good throwback to that film here as there's a scene where Lemmon has to spend the night with Matthau but can't put up with his dirty house. Ann-Margret returns but is pretty much wasted as is Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak. The perverted Burgess Meredith is back and steals the scene every time he's in it. Both Matthau and Lemmon are naturally very good and they easily slip back into their roles. It's priceless watching the two men work together even when the material isn't as strong as one would hope. Lemmon gets a special notice here due to a very touching scene with Meredith. Another problem is the direction, which has one of those \"made for TV\" feels to it. In the end this film could have and should have been a lot better but the cast make it worth watching. Sophia, twenty years later at 80, is still spectacular.; I saw a picture of Sophia on her eightieth birthday, demurely covering herself with a sheet and a heart-melting smile. All I could think of was the scene where she hitched up her bra and marched through the bar, and every man looked, and I do mean every man. I read later that she had \"improved\" the script for that. A reviewer in the SF Chronicle wrote later that she said she had had no \"touch- ups\", and if so then \"her genes need investigating.\" I remember her many films where her beauty was so natural that it was a wonder any man could concentrate on his lines. She never traded on it, but on her talent as an actress. Carlo Ponti was a lucky man: beauty without guile, talent without pretense. Italian pizza were like street food. When she heard we had so many pizza parlors, she thought we must be a poor country. Then she visited, and dined on American pizza. She reconsidered, gracefully and graciously.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Decent; Those of you who ranted and raved about how horrible this film was really tickle my funny bone. I love to see miserable people hate a movie just because...well, they have nothing to better to do. Not saying this was the best movie I've ever seen. But I agree with others who say that Bassett and Levine are the ones to save this film from drowning with all the other horrible movies. I love Angela Bassett, I'm a huge fan of hers. The scene which depicts the morning after her husband leaves her for his secretary, which would've otherwise been too cliché for my taste had it not been for the way Bernie (Bassett) burned up that BMW! I mean that was classic. Sorry if any of you testosterone-fueled men out there will accuse me of man hating, but I love that scene and will watch it over and over again. Three cheers for Angie. And Devine's character, Gloria seems sort of weak and unable to stand up to even her teenage son, but I love how she bends a little and confesses how she feels to the late Gregory Hines' character. You'll notice Devine's Gloria and Bassett's Bernie are slightly juxtaposed but their chemistry is excellent. If you haven't seen it, check it out, if not for anything but the performance of these two gifted actors. Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" This film does Terry McMillan's writing no justice; This movie had great potential had it landed in the right directors hands (as seen with How Stella got Her Groove Back).  Many rough cuts, sloppy editing, and terrible lighting at times to name a few.  Casting was excellent with the exception of Whitney Houston who has the tendency to over-chew her scenes.  Though much of the book was not adapted to the film the strength and love amongst four friends was apparent.  It was the one thing that was not lost or left on the cutting room floor.  Good movie, better book. Waiting to Exhale (the movie) ***** (5 stars) Waiting to Exhale (the novel) ********** (ten stars) A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . Feel Good Movie; The acting in this film is phenomenal, especially on the part of Angela Bassett who always does an amazing job (see What's Love Got To Do With It). The inter-cuts work well where they are placed, much like all of the other shots, and keep the films pace and the viewer interested. I've read other user comments and I find their opinions to be completely biased and unwarranted. If you're watching this film looking for profound insight to life you will be disappointed. This film is an adaptation of Terry McMillan's critically acclaimed novel FOR BLACK FEMALES. Waiting to Exhale explores the lives of four female friends. Each woman makes mistakes and has to deal with those consequences. But it is through being there for one another that they overcome these problems and others. For me, most of the negative user comments are from people who the film was not made for, that are only analyzing the film from the story. There is more to a film than it's narrative and when base your full opinion on that alone you are missing out. Plus, for me, it's just flat-out annoying when people who are completely not the target audience bash a film. Note: this is not to say that art cannot breach color, age or sex barriers. But be let's be realistic for a moment. If say, a heterosexual, black, 21 year old female studying Art was asking you for a good movie suggestion for a Friday night...Would you suggest The Dukes Of Hazard? I think not. Not unless you were joking. Sticky; There was nothing in the movie that made me excited. The message did not come through,  if there was one. Perhaps it is to convey the idea that men are useless,  or that relations are complicated because women make it complicated. If a comedy,  I did not laugh.  If a drama,  I did not find it dramatic. It was like drinking a cup of coffee presented to you with way too much sugar. Whitney ruined the great potential; Angela Basset was good as expected, but Whitney has no Range as an actress. The screenplay also neglected to portray, on film, the greatness of this novel.  Instead of promoting sisterhood, they emphasized the canine-qualities of men.  Read the book; rent Soul Food instead! Excellent for the broken heart...; Perhaps the reason they call this movie a chick flick, is because that's exactly who it's aimed at. Women. I don't see this as a man bashing movie, but more as a \"how do you deal?\" type of movie. It covers every situation: The unworthy co-worker, The drug-addict boyfriend, the gay husband, the cheating husband, the married man, the New Years fling, the sweet attractive neighbor, the teenage son....but most importantly, it show how women react and deal with the lies, the cheating, and the friendships between both men AND women...and how to survive from that. Any woman who has ever gone through a relationship can relate to this movie, regardless of race, situation, or age. You will want to scream, cry and laugh throughout the whole movie, and I can guarantee that every woman has got a little Angela Bassett in her, especially when she rips through her ex-husbands belongings. Two thumbs up...A definite must-see for any woman with a wounded heart. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about 15 or 16 and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. A real disaster!; This movie is awful! The caracters are shallow and almost ridiculous, especially Lela Rochon. It's a very, very, very bad soap opera. I was watching this movie with my wife and we were laughing almost all the time. It is much too long, with no rhythm with absolutely no emotions. It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one cliché after another. Skip it, it's a waste of time! Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this 1995 film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Pathetic; This film is simply about a bunch of women who pick men who's behaviors they claim to hate & then spend the rest of their time complaining about them. It seems that this view is held by many women & possibly accounts in some measure to the number of women who consider their relationships with men to be unsatisfying. My favorite movie ever !; I'm so surprised by the comments i read here. Since i saw that movie maybe 10 years ago now, it's one of my favorite movie ever along with boomerang.Maybe it's because i was fairly young when i watched those movies.. but i find them extremely good. I watched the movie before i read the book and it may be the reason why i loved the movie so much. Sure Whitney's acting could have been better but she managed to do a pretty decent job overall. As for the soundtrack it's a pure bliss for RnB lovers and i would say a classic now. The image of Black men in the movie is very negative but in a sens it pushed to be the exact opposite so it kinda shaped my vision and my life, and \"deepend\" my love of black women. Some parts of the movie are just so classic like the break up between Robin and troy on the balcony and the soundtrack at that moment was some kind of a symphony.. anyways great great movie .. enjoy Extra in Movie; I was actually an extra in this movie and had a quite a fun time hanging out w/the cast/crew. I had an opportunity to be at several of the locations for days of filming and it was a lot of work. You don't realize what a day of filming entitles until you actually do it and I was just an extra. I was more interested in the process of the film making than being on camera so it was a great opportunity. I even got \"spoiled\" and met a lot of the cast and drove around in the SUV's that are for the main cast...fun stuff! I think over all the movie was to enjoy for fun. I think the basis of the friendships were the most important aspect of the film. That through all the craziness of men in their lives they were still there for one another. hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Hilarious in Parts; 1995 was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in 1995, the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker. 6 of 10 stars. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT.

You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. in response to your response; I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :) I wanna move to Arizona; I thought It was a great movie, although it is a lot of sleeping with other women husband that are taken, we all have to be honest, this goes on a lot in reality. it's not right, but it happens.... Overall I really enjoy the movie because it took me way back to 1995, the movie was great. great times, although I was just 11 when it came out, I remember all the hype over this movie from my mom n my aunts.... One factor that I've never notice before was the setting... It makes me wanna pack up my family an move to peaceful Arizona.. Great Movie. r.i.p. Whitney Houston I cannot believe it took me all this time to see this movie all the way through... WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. I give this one 2 out of 10. FAbuLOuS; Simply fabulous. I thought it was a great movie. I was completely empowered! It made me want to start my exes car on fire. Embrace your independence  watch this movie. (is great to watch with the scorned over glasses of wine and bon bons) It'll make you laugh, cry, get mad, and then plot getting even. I can waste a lot of your time telling you to see it, defending it from what others say about it, or just generally talking it up. But haven't you always wanted to see Angela Basset throw a fit? How bout cut her hair off? And who wouldn't want to watch Whitney act with humility. This is by far my favorite movie with Whitney - second, The Bodyguard - third, The Preachers Wife. Frustrating...; That's the word I'd use to describe the film, an adaptation of Terry McMillan's 1992 best-seller. It's not great, it's not bad, but it's frustrating to watch, and the fact that I'm of the male persuasion undoubtedly had something to do with it. Now, let me be the first to say that I did enjoy seeing a group of strong black women portrayed onscreen. To say that Hollywood has been exceedingly lax in this regard is an understatement. But it would've been nice if their collective talents hadn't been squandered on this disgustingly anti-male tirade. Especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine, who otherwise shine in everything their names are attached to. Good, solid movies about sisterhood are probably needed now more than ever, but not at the cost of shortchanging the good, upright, decent brothers out there, whom this movie largely forgets about (with some notable exceptions -- Gregory Hines, for example.) And the frustration doesn't end there. Both Savannah and Robin manage to find themselves involved with the most shady characters (a married man and a dope fiend, respectively), yet they complain about the lack of good men out there. I suppose it would be silly to question just where they've been looking, even though it might hold the answer. The sad thing is that there are fellas out there who have little to no regard for women (\"the scum of the f__king earth\", to quote Savannah), and women who fall for fellas like that for the most silly, shallow reasons. If it wasn't for Bassett, Devine, and Babyface's score, this movie would barely be watchable. As it is, it's a moderately entertaining diversion, albeit a frustrating one. Don't Exhale Just Yet; I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It's not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others, it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However, the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria -- even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger, Holly Hunter, Alfre Woodard and others. Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight, insecure no-nonsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight, but she was the only one who found it (and deserved it). She was the only one who didn't sleep around, wasn't a man basher, set a good example for her son, and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face -- look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things, her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent, good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie. Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package --- beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life - she could now start her catering business, she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end. Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book, you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men. Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same -- Whitney Houston being well groomed, pretending to be well spoken and classy, and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise (although she might have been too young). The character had to tell us she was smart -- in a phone conversation with her mother she said \"I'm smart, I'm a good person and I work hard.\" Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills, doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end. This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn't \"tell this story\" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were. Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue? Sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE HARD TRUTH) looked VERY beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts REALLY made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Good movie, Better book; This wasn't a bad movie. The acting was great (although Whitney Houston still seems mediocre). Some of the scenes were powerful and funny. However, unlike the book which also deals with the sisterhood of Black women, the movie becomes a long \"Men are pigs\" tirade that gets weary after a while. Plus it's sometimes hard to root for the characters. For instance, considering all the one-night stands Savannah has, it's hard to see why she's questioning her ability to find a good man. Overall, Waiting to Exhale, is basically a sorely-needed bonding movie for African-American women that, while a little biased, is good escapist fun. Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops & horrible movies. A One-Sided Celebration of African American Feminism; Directed by Forest Whitaker and adapted from a smash best selling novel by Terry McMillan, WAITING TO EXHALE is a glossy, but one-sided look at the relationship between four strong black women and the various men in their lives. The film is one-sided because the screenplay presents most of the male characters as sexist, manipulative pigs without a redeeming characteristic in sight, but the sensitive direction and outstanding performances keep the rather lopsided story watchable. Whitney Houston made an impressive film debut as Savannah, an ambitious television executive caught in a dead-end affair with a married man (Dennis Haysbert). Angela Basset does Oscar-worthy work as Bernadine, a woman who has spent her life being the best wife and mother she knows how to be, who has her world rocked when her wealthy husband (Michael Beach) calmly announces one night before a formal dinner party that he's in love with someone else and wants a divorce. The scene where Bernadine gathers all her husband's stuff and makes a bonfire out of it in her driveway is one of the film's highlights. Lela Rochon plays Robin, a not-too-bright doormat who finds herself pregnant by a man she wants nothing to do with. Loretta Devine is fun as Gloria, a hairdresser who is divorced from her husband, who it turns out was gay, and is struggling to raise her son (Donald Faison) and tries to begin a relationship with a new neighbor (Gregory Hines). If you can accept the fact that in the world of these four women, all men are pigs, then this film can be very entertaining but the top-notch performances by the cast cannot be overlooked. A bit too soapy but deserves respect for being a positive film for black women; Vannah is travelling to see her friend Bernie while leaving behind all her old live to start anew.  Bernie has just been left by her husband of 13 years for a white woman.  Robin wants to be loved and happy but always makes the wrong choices.  Glo has an estranged husband and the only man in her life is her teenage son.  The four get together through their struggles in love and live as they try to put it all together again. This is very much a woman's film and, as a man, it's easy for me to criticise it for being a weepy or for being a bit of a woman love in, so I won't.  The plot is pure soap opera, the lives and loves of our 4 women, however it is still involving as the four stories all have strengths as well as weaknesses.  The mix of comedy and sentiment is a bit too much 20:80 and at times the sentiment gets too much, but the sassy characters keep the interest. The soapy sentiment isn't helped by a poor soundtrack and poor use there of. In itself I like some of the love ballad r'n'b stuff  but here it felt like it was all over every scene.  This really bogs it down. Also a down side is the whole man hating thing  only a few come off looking good.  I thought the director being a man would help redress the balance but it seemed to have no effect. Why  can someone tell me  was Houston chosen to lead this talented black cast?  Was it because she could do a cut price soundtrack?  She's a poor actress and he spoiled her scenes  she needs to stay in TVM's.  Bassett however is powerful as ever and really steals every single scene she's in.  Devine adds comedy and sauce while Rochon is perfect as the vulnerable beauty going about love the wrong way.  The male cast is great too  there are so many well known faces in this with only two criticisms of them  1  everytime I see Haysbert now all I can think of is his 24 character.  And 2  Wesley Snipes' character just don't convince me at all. Overall to criticise this for being girly or sentimental is to miss the point.  It is actually good to see a film with so many good roles for black actresses.  It's a bit too soapy for my taste but it is funny and involving with a commanding Bassett.  Only Huston, a soppy soundtrack and constant man caricatures spoil it. Double Standard; So I finally got around to watching \"Waiting to Exhale\" on Encore the other night and I don't understand why this became a hit. (Note: spoilers ahead) As far as I can tell, the basic premise of this film is that all men are insensitive, callous and unfeeling; especially towards women. Okay, well and good. That is the storyline? Fine. Men suck, got it. But there is a huge double standard here; two of the women are dating married men and clearly, we are meant to be sympathetic about their plight as they whine and cry about not having \"their\" man with them at night in bed. How about this? STOP DATING MARRIED MEN! Maybe that's your problem in the first place. Now, on the flip side, Angela Basset's character is abandoned by her husband for another woman. Yet, if you pay attention, even this character is not completely innocent. When her husband informs her he is leaving, the things she says makes it clear she's known about his lover(s) for years but ignored his infidelities. Why? Obviously, because he's so wealthy. She liked all the \"stuff\" a little too much to have confronted him about it. Again, she's made her bed here, not as completely as the two who are actively cheating, but still. She spends the rest of the movie being so angry that he left her you never really grow to like her. Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer; he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar. With their clothes on, which apparently means it's oh-so-platonic and sweet. Then he writes her a letter months later, thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off, he'll contact her again. Did anyone else think this was more than a little sleazy? I would hope if I were dying of breast cancer that my husband wasn't out sleeping around (and I do mean just sleeping) with other women. Sweet, platonic, whatever; I think it's pretty horrible. Bottom line; the characters you're supposed to connect to are unlikable and the ones you're supposed to hate are just pathetic. Not very enjoyable. However, I did give it three stars for the music, which didn't suck too badly and the clothes and style. It's a nice little snapshot of how things looked in '95. And the print wasn't very faded. That's about it, though. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Hot Soundtrack, Terrible Character Development; Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end.  It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.  However, much of this is wasted on poor character development.  Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover.  What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies.  While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all.  For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script.  Clearly the answer is that it isn't.  Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with.  Why the director didn't see this, I don't know. Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface. 4/10 Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. A 3 is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. not bad; this movie and its story are quite good on the whole..........Ms Bassett is the leading and the best actress,for sure.I get her character.she's beautiful and I guess she's blown people away with her beauty and the EASE WITH WHICH SHE FASCINATES.Ms HOUSTON IS NOT TO NEGLECT NEITHER.She looks natural in this one.And despite her little experience as far as her actress career is concerned,she is good even though her story is a bit common .Loretta is divine!Anyways,this motion picture is merely good.There's nothing amazing.And it don't stand out from all the other movies.the only thing that makes me stick to the screen is the complicity and the crude humor on men of the four ladies! Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life. Please. great touching story; While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life's mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation. WAITING TO EXHALE : Waiting To Go Somewhere, But Sadly It Never Does...; WAITING TO EXHALE Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. \"Waiting To Exhale\", Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book, had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it's star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene. \"Waiting To Exhale\" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone. It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn't know the word \"feelings\" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change. For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they've experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don't seem to learn squat. It's like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. \"Waiting To Exhale\" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose. ... D ... Great female flick of the '90s!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track 6: This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true.  \n",
       "4

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   A (Rare) Good Sequel; The first \"Father of the Bride\" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin's great comedic \"Dad\" character with the emotions of marrying off his \"only\" (to that point!) daughter. However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor. Thankfully, \"Father of the Bride II\" does not fall into this trap. With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather. Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton). Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women! Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments. Whereas the first film captured George's equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George's identity crisis. With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family. Overall, this film is just as good as the original. The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare. Let's just say that if a \"Grandfather of the Bride\" were in the works, I would be first in line. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in 1995. It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. 2.5 out of 5 stars. Deja Vu; I found this sequel to be both charming and entertaining. What I learned tonight is that this movie is actually a remake of the 1951 movie \"Father's Little Dividend\", which in turn was the sequel to the original \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and with the same great cast: Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Bennett, et al.  They both share the same broad comedy and story line (only one pregnancy in the earlier version though), and in their own ways are equally entertaining.  Old or new incarnations, however, be sure to see parts one and two in sequence. Better than the original; This one is definitely better than the original, funnier, smoother pace, and in some places, better acting! Plus Martin Short has more screen time. Great! This is a great movie for anyone who like good clean comedy. Awesome! Five out of Five Moose Stars! Father of the Bride II; Likable, but not as impressive a follow up to the 1991 hit with Martin now dealing with his daughter being pregnant...And, oh yeah...his wife is pregnant again too. Entertaining, but the premise has been worn thin -- it's sweet, but unnecessary.; The original \"Father of the Bride\" with Spencer Tracey is a really good comedy, the remake starring Steve Martin is a good sweet-natured, amiable enough comedy - and I don't really think a sequel was necessary at all. I mean the whole premise is basically the same - before George Banks (Martin) had to grasp the reality of his daughter being married, and now he has to come to grips with the fact that she's having a baby. A nice twist on this is that his wife (played by Diane Keaton) is ALSO pregnant, but nevertheless it's still (basically) the same as the first film in one form or another. Thankfully it doesn't seem like a total cash-in (like so many sequels of this sort do) because it has a certain charm (as did the first film) and is still remarkably entertaining, all considered. But you can tell it was made solely because of the success of the first film - even Martin Short is back with another extended cameo as Franz the wedding manager. Of course you may be wondering why he's involved with a pregnancy, since his business is weddings. Here's a hint: more $$$ for the studio. Martin is basically doing the same thing he did in the first film - the weary upper-class guy who feels overwhelmed by the state of things. Diane Keaton is still very sweet and likable as his wife. The rest of the cast (including Macaulay's little brother Kieran Culkin) range from OK to good. Martin Short, however, is yet again a stand-out and is very funny - he wasn't necessary for the plot but he is funny and a good addition to the movie regardless. Overall I'd say this is one of those sequels that didn't need to be made, but could have been a lot worse. It's sweet, it's got some good lite-comedy moments, and in general it's just an enjoyable family movie that isn't trying to be anything other than simple entertainment -- which it is. Touching even in its weak state.; Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, and kimberly Williams Paisley return in Father of the Bride Part 2. The film as a sequel was slightly disappointing, but on the whole, likeable. George and Nina Banks are in for the surprise of their lives when they find themselves middleaged and expecting their third child.  The timing is impeccable as Annie Banks-MAckenzie also realizes that she is expecting. Thus Steve MArtin embarks on a nine month journey that will consist of him building a new room for the baby, watching his daughter become a woman and overdosing on sleeping pills.  Honestly, the film made me laugh hysterically and i shed a few tears at the bittersweet ending. 3 and 1/2 stars out of five. Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\".

AWESOME!; This movie is great!  I think it's one of the best movies ever made!  I love both Father of the Bride I and II!  I think that it is cute how they have the mother and daughter pregnant at the same time!  I hope that they come out with a Father of the Bride Part III, that would be awesome! :-) This is my favorite movie; ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is my favorite movie.  I think it is funny, sweet, and truly touches the heart.  In the sequel to the previous, Father of the Bride, George Banks (Steve Martin) is finally getting over the fact that his beloved daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams)has gotten married.  But then she shocks him with the news that she is pregnant.  Everyone else is thrilled, but George is not.  He believes that he is too young to be a grandfather.  He tries to become young, but doesn't succeed.  Then, both he and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton) are shocked to find out that Nina is also pregnant.  George now thinks he is too old to be a father.  They have one other child other then Annie, Matty (Kieren Culkin.)  Through the chaotic turns of pregnancy, George learns to except the fact that his daughter has grown up and moved on, even though it is hard.  They also have to deal with Fronk (Martin Short,) the goofy wedding coordinator from the first movie, who is now designing the new baby's room.  They then discover that Annie has been given the opportunity to design a museaum in Boston, far away from their own, San Marino, California.  George now realizes that he will miss his daughter more then ever, but he learns to get along.  In the end, he enjoys being a grandfather to baby George, and a father again, to Megan, named after the doctor who delievered her.  In this funny and heartwarming sequel, everyone puts out fantastic performences once again.  Even though I very much enjoy Father of the Bride, I enjoy this much more. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. The Best Movie of All Time; let me tell you.. anyone who does not like the movie is just a little close minded.. i read comments that thought the movie was too unrealistic but thats what makes it so great! i mean look at other movies such as lord of the rings or star wars neither or them contain true reality.. this is why its a movie. Anyway, i loved Steve martin in this movie. he does a magnificent job of playing the character for an over protective dramatic father. he was the best actor. who could have played the part of Nina as well as Diane Keaton. she makes the part of the mom annoyingly overwhelming mother, which is exactly what the point of us as the audience to think of her. martin short is the best of all \"fra'nk's\". the way he seeks George banks's approval is perfect. and lastly Kimberly Williams is the gorgeous daughter we are all expecting her to be.. i watch this movie every night before bed and i can recite every word to this movie. because of father of the bride II i have dreamed to meet Steve martin.. \"hes my hero!!\" hopefully you fall in love with it too. and dream to be pregnant with your mother as did Annie banks. A Well-Done Sequel!; A sequel to immensely likable Father of the Bride, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is A Well-Done Sequel! Its enjoyable as well as emotional! 'Father of the Bride Part II' Synopsis: George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. 'Father of the Bride Part II' is worthy sequel of a wonderful prequel. The characters still appeal, the humor works & the emotional moments are heartfelt as well. Nancy Meyers & Charles Shyer's Screenplay is genuinely well-done. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography & Editing are fair. Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains. On the whole, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is a satisfying sequel. A so so sequel; 'Father of the bride' was a good film and probably didn't need a sequel. But this is Hollywood, everything needs a sequel. While it is clear that a lot of effort has gone into making this sequel work, the central idea stretches credibility and every idea the writer had seems to have been thrown at the wall in a desperate attempt to get laughs. There are moments that remind you of the heart and humour that the preceding film had, but it's a load of nothing really. I went into this film dubious about how good it could be, and I didn't finish watching it any more convinced that the original needed a sequel. daughter gets married; In the sequel to Father of the Bride we have the daughter getting married and moving away from home, this presents a big dilemma to the father played of course by Steve Martin. Maybe not quite as funny as the first one,, or as good,, but definitely above average,, it's always a pleasure watching Steve Martin work at his craft. The movie is basically about how the family,, especially the parents deal with their young daughter growing up,, getting married, and eventually moving away from the nest.. the cameo from Eugene Levy is just wonderful,, as a real estate agent who is trying to sell the very home where our main character lives.. all in all a very family friendly movie,, that I would recommend. Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. Better than the first one!; I love Steve Martin, but I was disappointed by the first movie, so I wasn't expecting as much from this one.  But to my surprise, this one was even better! It's constantly funny, just like one should expect from Steve Martin; it's not preoccupied with corny emotion, like the first movie was. It's Steve Martin in his best performance since \"My Blue Heaven.\" Sometimes sequels can be surprisingly good.  This one is better.  It has all the comedic elements that were stagnant in the first movie.  It's everything the first movie should have been, and more! Father of the Bride Part II; The first film was the remake of the original version starring Spencer Tracy and Dame Elizabeth Taylor, and it became very popular, so naturally they felt like a sequel was needed to continue the story. Basically George Banks (Golden Globe nominated Steve Martin) is getting used to the fact that his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) has become the bride now wife and got married to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), and more surprisingly a mother when she reveals she is pregnant. With this revelation comes out George has a small midlife crisis, and he tries to recapture his youth, including dying his hair, but he does eventually settle somewhat and get used to the idea that he will be a grandfather. But then he is shocked to find out he will be a father again as well when his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) reveals that she is also pregnant, and it may appear that both her and Annie's baby will be born on the same day. With these things happening, and the house having leaks and termites there is the opportunity to change things by selling the house to Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy), but he changes his mind later. When George manages to get the house back, despite a higher price, he gets the help of camp wedding planner/coordinator, now interior designer, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) to make the baby rooms and get things ready for the arrival of children. There are a couple of false alarms from Annie where she thinks the baby is coming, but eventually it comes to the real thing, and they rush to hospital, and of course Nina goes in to labour as well. In the end George is very happy to be holding both his new baby son and his new baby granddaughter is his arms, before his daughter and her husband move away to their own new home. Also starring Kieran Culkin as Matty Banks, B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein, Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie and Jane Adams as Dr. Megan Eisenberg. I can see what the critics mean by giving it two out of five stars in certain places, it certainly isn't as funny as the original film, it concentrates more on the sentimental material, but that's not a bad thing for this comedy drama. Okay! Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. 5/10 \"Father 2\" : Born again.; Okay,now the sequel \"Father Of The Bride 2\",which was surprisingly better than expected. Like anyone who sees a sequel,you expect almost a carbon copy of the first. It does start similar to the first movie,with George sitting in a chair addressing us,the audience. It also does an unfortunate repeat of the fight between Annie & Bryan,again like the first movie,I saw it coming. The baby shower party is not played big,like the first after wedding party but I laughed when actual storks carrying little bundles showed up. I was kind of \"iffy\" on the sub-plot of George selling the house,having to leave in ten days and then blowing a bundle to get it back again. I'm not questioning the probability (we know in reality that'd be impossible),I just found it kind of unnecessary. I did however like his dyed hair and new look,that was hilarious and he should have kept it until the end of the movie. Some may say the idea of a mother & daughter being pregnant at the same time,is impossible. Yet,somehow it works here. It's not just the obvious next step for Annie but for George and his wife too,who thought having babies was way behind them. I love Steve Martin's warped expression when Bryan calls him a \"Grandfather\"! I liked that a woman having a baby in her 40's was taken very seriously,since it's a fact that women who have babies later in life have a more difficult time. It makes for a good piece of drama in a film that's otherwise a family comedy. The comedy is helped once again by the presence of Martin Short and I like that he becomes more involved with the family. Especially helping George out the front door on his back. This after giving him sleeping pills for rest. Once the babies are born and Bryan & Annie head to Boston for a new life,the film gets a very touching ending with George and his new baby girl. 8 out of 10 for the expected repeat of ideas,otherwise a very well made sequel. (END) not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the 1951 movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the 1950 classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the 4 year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com Not bad...but could have been better; The first time I saw Father of the Bride 2 I really liked it.  I still enjoy watching some parts of it but I thought some realistic parts in the movie were not necessary.  First of all, the mother and daughter pregnant together.  This could happen but probably when the mother is not older than 40.  Nina had to be at least 47.  Is it likely that the mother would be pregnant at that age? I don't think so.  Secondly, I could not understand why George and Nina wanted the baby to have two last names.  Children always go by their father's last name and I thought Brian's father made a good observation when he said that George and Nina already had Matt to carry on the Banks name.  So why they thought the baby should have two last names is beyond me.  In conclusion, Father of the Bride 2 is still cute and fun to watch in some parts but I thought the first one was much better Some of Martin's best work!; First, this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2. If run back to back, they run like one beautiful story. This production is great from start to finish. Everything about it is wonderful, including the story, the acting performances and the direction. This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor. His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances. He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man. This movie is no exception. His performance is comedic, yet startlingly genuine. Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's. I love this movie. I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character; with how he feels, and what he's going through. This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum, and I love it. It's less about family, and more about life's curves; the every-day things that make us crazy, happy, sad, and ultimately stronger. It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think, consider, ponder the events which have led us to where we are now. Combined, they rate 8.6/10 from... the Fiend :. Good, so long as you don't try to think too much; It was a fun movie, but it had no particular substance. I mostly watched it because I'd seen the first one. And because it was free on my cable. Or at least, I wasn't paying only to see it. Now, I have done that before and been pleasantly surprised, but this just wasn't one of those movies. Most of what was in this movie has been done already in the first film, and then it was in a much better way. Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, I'm just glad that I got to watch it free. Sure, Steve Martin's always fun to watch, particularly when he's acting dopey for whatever reason, but that didn't make it a great film. Just mediocre. Still, it's fun for a laugh. Average comedy sequel; There's been better, and there's been worse. \"Father of the Bride Part II\" falls right in between when it comes to sequels of comedies. The plot was easily predictable and the movie didn't have as many Steve Martin funny moments as the original. There were some good moments that made me laugh though, most being scenes with Martin Short. It did seem like sort of a stretch, though that all of the sudden \"Frank\" was an interior designer as well as a wedding/baby shower coordinator. I guess they just needed a way to keep him in the movie longer. I was hoping for a lot more when I rented this. My advice: stick to the original. Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! Worthy second installment.; Mild SPOILERS are contained in the following comments. However, I believe everyone knows the story and how it turns out. The fun of the movie is seeing the actors, especially Martin. Steve Martin is back as George Banks, having just lost his daughter and basketball partner (Kimberly Williams as Annie ) to marriage, and now she is back home with her husband and a big announcement. She is pregnant. Of course everyone is happy, and the joy is doubled when Nina Banks (Diane Keaton as Annie's mom) finds out she is pregnant too. Poor George doesn't know if he can handle all this. After all, he is about to be a grandfather, he's not prepared to be a new father also. Martin Short is back as Franck Eggelhoffer, the unintelligible wedding planner. All ends well as both mom and daughter deliver their babies at the same time, in separate hospital rooms, so George has to go back and forth. The movie ends a few months later, and as Annie and her new baby are leaving, she gives dad a miniature basketball, a reminder to George that he can raise another basketball partner. Like Cliches?; ...That weren't even funny the first time? I've seen a lot of films with Steve Martin in them, and they all made me laugh.  Until this one. Part one is worth a look..it may make you laugh a couple of times (I think I laughed once).  But I recommend avoiding this one all together. not bad for a sequel; as sequels go,this is film isn't too bad.i didn't think ti was quite as good as the first one,but it's not a bad effort.i didn't find it as funny,and some of Steve Martin's histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me.really,this one doesn't quite have the same sincerity as the first.through much of this movie,i was all too aware i was watching a movie,whereas with firs tone,i was drawn in,and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting.having said that,there are some bright spots.for,one,this movie is just as touching as the first.and Eugene levy has a great cameo.and there is still some fun to be had.even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above,i still think Father of the Bride II is a 7/10 Not as good as the first, but still great fun.; In the sequel to the brilliant Father Of The Bride, Nina Banks and her daughter Annie are both pregnant and George Banks, being his usual nervous self has to learn to get used to the idea that he's going to be a father again AND a grandfather. The whole cast including, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams and Martin Short are all back here giving good performances. Even though Father Of The Bride Part II is not as good as the first Father Of The Bride, this is still a great movie which is enjoyable and fun all the way through and that's why I'm going to give this good sequel a 10/10.  Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. Good; This is well worth seeing. Everything goes perfectly. Ain't no such thing as too much Steve Martin, baby. Here Martin carries weak material, but it's a positive movie that shows the joy a new child brings. You will laugh, cry and cheer. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Some of the dialog is a bit lost on US audiences, but still some hilarious lines. The music is amazing throughout. Also the scenery is incredible. I saw the cast had a lot of great comedians, so I thought there would at least be a few laughs. Instead, I was surprised to see a very touching movie, absolutely great script. I give it 7 out of 10. What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... A really likable comedy.; I enjoyed this film. I found that it was easy to relate to Steve Martin's character George Banks as a parent. The relationship between him and his daughter Annie, played by Kimberly Williams, was an honest father daughter relationship. I recommend this one for parents in general and empty nesters in particular. The idea of a mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time is plausible and amusing. Fantastic; Both the first movie and this sequel are fantastic. I loved the first movie, so I thought I would give the second one a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised!! The acting from all the characters is amazing, from Steve Martin to Diane Keaton to Kimberly Williams-Paisley. 16 years after its release this movie is still a gem. When I'm feeling down or just need a go-to comedy for a night in, these two movies are the best. For those who say that a 40-something woman is too old to have a baby--that's just not true. Do your research. I bet more people have been in that situation than you think. Anyway, this is a feel-good movie for some great laughs and a few happy tears! I really found this film quite annoying; My basic opinion of this movie is that it is a crappy American feel good comedy. It is simply about a man who is going through another mid-life crisis as his daughter, who was married in the first movie, has a baby in this one. The catch is that his wife is also pregnant and with the irony really dripping, both of them have their babies within minutes of each other. As such the kid's auntie is exactly the same age as him (it won't happen to me, though it is possible). When I watch this movie I think to myself, this guy really doesn't have problems. There are people out there that have much more serious problems than he does. He admits to having a beautiful wife who loves him, owns his own home (or did), has a great job and great kids - and he thinks he has problems. Maybe the whole comedy is in the fact that he is worrying about absolutely nothing, but seriously, when I watch this movie, I simply shake my head and think that the guy is a loser. I really don't think it is all that funny. In fact, the guy has much more serious problems. He seems to be spending an awful lot of money, and is going to find himself in a huge amount of debt, and he doesn't seem to ever be at work. My question is not only where he gets his money, but where he gets the collateral for all of the purchases he is making. He buys back his house for an extra $100,000 on top of what he sold it for, and really, how can he seriously afford it. Okay, it wasn't all that bad. As a movie is was made well, and I did chuckle a few times. But in reality, this guy is a serious loser because he has more than anybody could possibly ask for, and he is worried about growing old. Hell, we all grow old, but he has experience more than what a lot of us have already had. Instead of worrying about growing old, the twit should look back on his life and be thankful for the blessings that God has already given him as opposed to forgetting all of that and winging about his age. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a 10, i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Very Warm and Funny.; This movie is a very warm and funny family film. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the Sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny. The only thing I didn't like was Eugene Levy's character, I found that his part was just put there to extend the movie a bit. I also didn't like how they used him in the second one when he was clearly the one who auditioned to be the wedding singer in the first one. All in all this is a great family film where many will enjoy and watch together. I loved it, but one thing bothered me...; I enjoyed this movie: Diane Keaton is my favourite actress, Steve Martin always makes me laugh and Martin Short is great, but I felt really sorry for Keaton having to pretend to be pregnant. She didn't seem to be enjoying it and when the Banks were at the hospital, she actually looked rather bored, because whenever she spoke from the moment George protested about the doctor's name, she almost made it sound like she was in a maths lesson. Apart from that, it was great! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching Martin, Keaton or Short in a movie or who likes to laugh. 9/10 because of the little problem, but it was great. I loved it. Not exactly the most innovative of films, but still great fun!; This is an excellent, funny, warming film. Although a lot of the \"same kind of thing\" was done in the first movie, it's still entertaining. Steve Martin's character was good, although at times his behaviour is quite pathetic and Martin Short is again entertaining. (Particularly his pronunciation of the word 'pregnant).' Although it's highly predictable and not the most intellectually stimulating of films it is still well worth watching and the vast majority of people would enjoy this film. And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW2, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. As I understand it, there were accusations of anti-Arab stereotyping?; \"Father of the Bride II\" may seem to some people like a lesser Steve Martin movie, with him as the patriarch from the previous movie now having to deal with his daughter's and wife's pregnancies. Unpretentiously silly. But one interesting thing is that apparently, some Arab groups claimed that the movie was making anti-Arab stereotypes, as a Middle Eastern man buys their house with plans to demolish it. I wouldn't have interpreted that as anti-Arab; I mean, it's not like they're portraying him as a terrorist. Oh well, life goes on. The movie's a nice, goofy way to pass time. I really liked the scene where they bring Steve Martin into the hospital (that would've sure been an embarrassment!). Also starring Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, B.D. Wong and Eugene Levy. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the 1951 sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of 50. This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Heartwarming & Hilarious; Steve Martin does it again in this touching and funny sequel to 1991's Father Of The Bride the rest of the cast returns in a new story dealing with the joys of parenthood. I loved Father Of The Bride II not only because it was funny, mostly it was due to the comic antics of a man dealing with two pregnancies at once. He's a great comedian as well as an on screen father, my favorite scene is when both babies arrive at the same time. A year has passed since George Banks (Martin) watched his only daughter Annie (Williams) get married and has accepted her transformation from daughter to wife. She comes home with her husband Brian (Newbern) to announce the wonderful news to her parents, brother Matty (Culkin) and in-laws that she's pregnant. Everyone is thrilled and excited except for George who thinks he's too young to be a grandpa, from then on he tries to act young by dying his hair and exercising. But things are about to get a little crazy when his loving wife Nina (Keaton)discovers she's pregnant too now George must deal with the impending arrival of both his grandchild and his own child. Thrown into the chaos is Franck Eggelhoffer (Short) the wedding coordinator who helps to design a room for the new addition to the Banks family. This movie is not only sweet but it's charming entertainment for fans of all ages. Not bad, but inferior to the first; I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the first movie. It was not without sentiment and it was hardly original, but it was still beautifully filmed, well acted, charming and funny. This sequel is not as good as the first I agree, but I still quite enjoyed it. The story is predictable, and there are some so-so parts in the script. Eugene Levy, who I do like by the way, is okay here but his character felt somewhat unnecessary and felt like he was there as an additional character and to give the film a longer length. And I also would have liked to have seen more of Kimberley Williams, she is so beautiful and quite a good actress, but I actually do agree that a little too much time is spent between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. However, it is beautifully filmed, has a nice soundtrack, decent pacing and good direction. And the acting is fine too, Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are still very likable, and while as I've said I would have liked to have seen more of her Kimberley Williams was lovely. And I loved Martin Short here too, he was one of the main merits of the first film, so to see him in his wonderfully fluffy turn again was a very nice surprise. Overall, not bad at all, could have been better, but I liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Pretty much just a rehash of the first; As this movie started, it reminded me a lot of the first. Various scenes were reenacted, only a little wackier, sort of like it was trying to be a shade more funny than the first; I guess that is the usual stuff for this type of sequels, but I think it failed at that. Apart from that, the movie pretty much succeeds in being a good sequel to the first. The story is also somewhat reminiscent of the first one. All the same actors return as well, and they are pretty much the same, just a shade more wacky. The story is also told by Steve Martins character, George Banks, like in the first. Pretty much everything in the movie is a takeoff of the first; this doesn't make it bad though, if you liked the first, liked the characters, you'll want to see this too, if nothing else, to see the characters again. It is about as funny and as sentimental as the first was, and as enjoyable. Fans of the first one, or of Steve Martin will most likely enjoy at least some part of it, as this is the typical for both the first movie and Steve Martin. 7/10 Father of the Bride Part II; The 1991 Steve Martin comedy proved out to be popular enough to earn a sequel, much like the original Father of the Bride of 1950. All of the main cast of the first film returns in a story where the eponymous father George Banks (Martin) has gotten over the stressful wedding of his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) and her fiancé Bryan (George Newbern). However, when she breaks the big news about her pregnancy to the family, the grandpa-to-be becomes anxious about getting older and starts proving his youthfulness in various ways, such as selling the family's beloved house to a greedy real estate developer Habib (Eugene Levy). Life has more in store for George and his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) though, as it soon turns out that Annie's is not the only pregnancy in the family. Again, the humour is best when it relies on Steve Martin's comical talent and charisma instead of craziness and exaggeration. Unfortunately, adhering to the rule of always making sequels bigger and louder, the writers have given more screen time to the unbelievably annoying wedding planner Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) whose noisy and flamboyant scenes are certainly the weakest parts of the whole movie. The fussy bumbling caused by the impending childbirths at the end is also rather annoying and unimaginative. I think the movie works best during the more subtle scenes, such as Martin making uncomfortable faces while hiding his nervousness or arguing about the baby's surname with the overjoyed family during a dinner. Besides the run-of-the-mill jokes, the movie also shamelessly wallows in impenetrable sentimentalism of the newborns' adorability. Especially the music is so unbelievably schmaltzy that it was really getting on my nerves while watching; can't the filmmakers just trust their material's appeal without burying it under a sweety-tweety sugar mountain? Nevertheless, despite the predictability of the plot and the not-so-hilarious jokes, George Banks is a very likable character and Steve Martin is at home in the role, so those who enjoyed the first movie will probably like this one too  the basic building blocks of the story have not been changed at all. One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. My comments are going to be very positive.; Hi! I think that Father of the Bride Part 2 was a great film and very hilarious. I think that the mother and daughter could have been pregnant at the same time!  It was a great movie and I recommend it to all people who want a warm-your-heart comedy! It's a great film! Thanks! Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. Loved it!!; I thought the sequel to the first Father of the Bride just showed what a great chemistry Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, George Newbern, and Kieran Culkin, along with all the other supporting actors have together. I would actually love to see a Father of the Bride Part III and I usually hate more and more sequels. I really do enjoy this sequel and I think it is better than the first one. I would reccommend any and everyone seeing this movie (but not without seeing the first one). like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $15k bonus to move out in 10 days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $100k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. Good, but first one was better; This film is good but you have to suspend disbelief quite a few times. All the performances are fine, with Steve Martin a scream again, and Diane Keaton glowing from start to finish (she has a lot more to do here than in FOTB1). The best scenes are: George trying to get buff in the gym, asking which famous men he's younger than, pointing to his wedding ring at the lady in the car next to him, and seeing all the misbehaving children out the window in his car while his wife sees all the happy kids and their parents out her window. And of course, when George holds his child and grandchild outside the delivery room. My favorite line: \"Now going to the movies will be economical: one child, two seniors, thanks!\" good, but a mistake; this movie rocks. but there is one thing weird. okay, so in the beginning Annie says, \"i have lived here since i was 5!\" and then later right when they are selling the house and playing basketball Annie and George(her dad) and her dad says \"i remember the first time we played out here, you were 4.\" wait...so was she 4 or 5 when they moved in??????????? other than that this movie makes me laugh, cry(because i laugh so much), and..........uh.....what was that other thing people say when they say that? i don't really remember. i just love how Steve martin always is so cheap. I am forced to say more so i will say i love that this movie is always on HBO! And i realized something, Steve martin has had white hair like forever! Not as good as the first, but good family fun; This movie is as thin as you can get. Its' emotions are easily played. There are no surprises. It is very predictable. And I say...so what? What is wrong with that? This is an American Dream movie. Everything goes perfectly and everyone is as happy as can be. Why should it be a complicated character study? It deals with the birth of babies. There's no complex feelings that need to be dealt with in this situation. A life is being created. A family is being blessed. A baby's birth is a time for love and hope. This movie has both in spades. It's a very positive movie that shows the joy a new baby brings. Every parent-to-be should watch it. A child's birth is an emotional event with no equal. This movie knows it and milks it for all its' worth. My only complaint is it should have been called Parents of the Bride. Way too much time is spent with the relationship between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. There should have been more attention paid to Kimberly Williams. Not only were the scenes between her and Martin the best scenes in this and the original, but Kimberly Williams is the most beautiful actress to come out of Hollywood in many years. Forget all the blond, silicone filled, bimbos that every teenage boy raves about. Ms. Williams is a natural beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late '40's)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now...  "

       "      <td>Simply Brilliant; It doesn't matter whether you're young or old, this is a great movie. Woody is Andy's favourite toy and like all the other toys lives with the fear of being discarded when new toys arrive. He's therefore very worried when Buzz Lightyear arrives. Buzz is an instant hit with Andy and Woody is not very happy. To make matters worse Buzz doesn't think he is a toy and believes he is on a mission. The story really gets going when woody inadvertantly knocks buzz out of the house and the two of them end up with evil Syd who tortures toys. There's lots of adult humour meaning that the parents will find this as funny as the kids. The real winning combination of Toy Story is the characterisation and the empathy you can feel for the animated leads. Although they're not real this is one of the best buddy movies ever made. My personal favourite character is Mr Potato Head because of the dry humour. A classic 10/10 toy story; The original and the best. Woody and the gang have only fun and games until Buzz shows up and steals Woody's thunder. Woody is a pull-string cowboy and the leader of a group of toys belonging to a boy named Andy Davis. With his family moving away one week before his birthday, Andy is given a week-early party to spend with his friends, while the toys stage a reconnaissance mission to discover Andy's new presents. Andy receives a space ranger Buzz Lightyear action figure, whose impressive features see him replacing Woody as Andy's favorite toy. Woody is resentful, especially as Buzz also gets attention from the other toys. However, Buzz believes himself to be a real space ranger on a mission to return to his home planet, as Woody fails to convince him he is a toy. Not one of my favorites; After hearing about the success of the toy story series, a rented a DVD which had a collection of Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc. I loved Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2 but I did not enjoy Toy Story 1 even that much. These were the points that I didn't like in the movie: 1) In the starting, when Andy is shown playing with the toys, he starts to get a bit annoying after he keeps on playing with it. His love for the toys throughout the film bugged me after a while. But I did not find this too boring as even my cousin is a great fan of Spiderman and keeps buying and playing with the toys. 2) The animation looked a bit faded in the movie. But I didn't pay much attention towards it giving an excuse that it was made in 1995 and compared to Finding Nemo and the other new movies, its animation would be a bit duller. 3) Sorry Tom Hanks, but I found your character quite annoying in the film as you kept screaming like a mad character and I did not like you that much. 4) Woody's girlfriend in the movie had a terrible voice. I expected a cute shepherdess's voice to be more cute and sweet rather that being a bit rough and sounding like the second woman in a love story. 5) Mr.Potato head and the other characters, except for the spring dog, really annoyed me when they were reluctant to listen to Woody. I mean, why couldn't they just wait and understand him. 6) The bad boy removed some parts of his toys to make them look terrible. But towards the end, when the toys help Woody and Buzz, Woody thanks them and just leaves. Why didn't he tell the toys to leave that stupid place and run away with them? They should have included these characters in the second film, at least. 7) Toys had lives in the movie. So why did they not just start living alive with the humans? Why do they fall still when their masters came? They could play alive with them. The movie had some good points too. Here are some of them: 1) Tim Allen has done a fantastic voicing as Buzz, and I liked Buzz in the movie as he was shown brave, his voicing was done well and he didn't bore me at all. 2) The dog who supported Woody was cute and I liked him, just, I liked him, in the movie. 3) The movie was different from other movies, as here, toys were shown as the protagonists. 4) The dinosaur was funny and his character uplifted the film. Overall, I don't think it deserves to be in the top 250 movies. But its the people's choice and if they wish that it would be in the top 250, then I can do nothing but give my review on the film. One of the all time greats - but you know that already.; The toys of a small boy have their cosy lives thrown into disarray with the arrival of a new space toy, and the family's imminent move to another home... The first real mainsteam adult-friendly computer animated film. Actually the first real computer-animated film. Toy Story took a cutesy premise and made it believable with a very good storyline, excellent voice acting and amazing design, especially for the time even though this holds up exceptionally well now. More important than this is the longevity of the characters, you can have the prettiest backdrop and brightest colours going but if a kid doesn't like the characters in the thing it isn't going far. Go to a birthday party for any kid under 10 and you'll likely see a Buzz Lightyear or Woody the cowboy. More important this film can be watched and rewatched by anyone from 3 to 43 and there will be something to enjoy, again and again. As a side-note: My videoshop password was Woody for about 5 years thanks to this movie. What you hope kids will learn: Be good to your toys. What they'll take away: Space toys are cool. And Cowboy toys are cool. And Dog toys are cool. And I need one of those Dinosaur toys. Oh, oh, oh and a Mr Potato Head... And a Piggy! And... If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com \"Toy Story\" - The best computer animated film for good reason; As a child, have you ever wondered at one point in your life what might happen in your room full of toys while you weren't in it? In Disney- Pixar's landmark 1995 computer animated feature \"Toy Story\", we get that possible answer as the film is about toys that come to life while the owner is out of their room. In case you don't know why \"Toy Story\" is an important American film and why it's one of only two animated films to make the AFI's list of the 100 greatest films of all time, allow me to fill you in. It was the first full-length computer animated feature ever made and arguably the best in my opinion. \"Toy Story\" was so popular that it was responsible for initiating Pixar's big streak of success with other computer animated features such as \"Up\" (2009), \"WALL-E\" (2008), and \"The Incredibles\" (2004). In \"Toy Story\", a group of toys that belong to a young kid named Andy come to life while he's out of the room. They're all led by Andy's favorite toy, a cowboy doll named Woody (Tom Hanks). They've just learned that Andy and his family will be moving away to another neighborhood. Not only that, but his birthday party is being celebrated earlier than expected, which means new toys will be joining them for sure, much to the horror of the other toys. They're afraid that the new toys will be so cool that Andy will no longer want to play with them anymore. Despite this, Woody assures the other toys that everything will be alright and no one will be forgotten. That is until he discovers Andy's newest toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a space ranger action figure who thinks he's the real space ranger that he's based on. Woody becomes so jealous over how cool a toy he is that he tries to do whatever he can to become Andy's favorite toy again. When one of his attempts at getting noticed by Andy accidentally goes too far (meaning Buzz gets transported out of the house), Woody tries to rescue him and re-earn the trust of his fellow toys. But through a series of circumstances, Woody gets lost right alongside Buzz and they are accidentally found by Andy's next door neighbor, Sid. This is a problem for both of these toys since Sid enjoys torturing and destroying toys. So now Woody and Buzz must get over their differences and work together to get out of Sid's house and back to Andy before he moves. What we have here story wise is your typical buddy comedy in animated form, but it's done right. I'm not saying it just because it's told through a new form of animation, but because the film handles this type of story in an imaginative way. The basic plot seems to play out naturally and comes off as if Pixar was inventing this type of plot for the first time. There are no plot devices that are forced to the point where it's painfully obvious. Everything on screen works within the fabric of the story. The comedic bits, along with being humorous, are very well handled and are necessary contributions to the plot. I loved how in one scene when Woody talks to the toys in Andy's room from Sid's house, the other toys think that Woody murdered Buzz by the end of the scene. That scene and similar scenes were very funny and well done. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are irreplaceable as Woody and Buzz, respectively, since they bring so much to the chemistry and dialogue between each other to the point where it's impossible to top them. They do a great enough job with what they bring into each of their roles that you couldn't picture hearing any other actors play these two characters. The same can also be said for the supporting cast as well, particularly Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn as Rex. The actors do a convincing job at bringing each of their characters to life and putting enough personality into them that they help enhance the story further as good acting should be doing. The way Pixar handles its characters in this movie is also worth noting. For example, even though Sid is having fun destroying toys and is considered evil by the toys, they don't necessarily make him the main villain. In other words, the characters created here aren't exactly clear cut heroes and villains, but they're simply individuals with different personalities. Woody isn't a bad guy because he technically gets Buzz and himself into trouble, he's simply afraid of being forgotten by Andy. That aspect about Woody makes us relate to him even more since we do learn from the mistakes that Woody makes over this misunderstanding. Buzz Lightyear makes for an enjoyable fish-out- of-water type character in that he strongly believes he's the real Buzz Lightyear to the point that being told that he's actually a toy would be nonsense in his mind. Pixar truly cared a great deal about its story and characters here. As you can tell, \"Toy Story\" is more than an innovative American film with its groundbreaking animation or even an entertaining family film. It's a film about characters that I'm sure most of us can relate to or identify with. It's a film for everybody to cherish for different reasons whether it be the animation, the humor, the story or the characters. I'll argue that it's still the finest film Pixar's produced yet. In a pinch, \"Toy Story\" is a film you should definitely check out if you haven't already. one of if not the best animated films ever; Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen. The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer. The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen. The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year) respecting everything around you and never being to greedy or needy. Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come up with. This is a film, that not only can the kids enjoy but also the adults too. Great fun, a film that's not just for kids; I wasn't too sure about this film before I watched it. The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story. The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up  something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space! Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home. Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is 6 years old, but I've only just seen it!). The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others  such as Mr. Potato Head  are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep  who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries! The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back. Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible. The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films  particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations. All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again. And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them? Well, now we know why! A fantastic family film.; The plot:A wooden cowboy doll called Woody is a young boy's favourite toy, yet when his owner gets a space toy of an astronaut called Buzz Lightyear, Woody has been left out of his owner's daily live. Woody finds out that Buzz Lightyear thinks that he really is a space ranger.     Both toys are now fighting each other while being kidnaped by the next door nieghbour that hates toys and must work together to get back to their owner before they are destroyed. The view:A wonderful enchanting and nicely funny story about rivally between two toys that are animated very well, with the fact of the movie being the first that was computer animated, this movie is really for everyone that enjoys watching a film that the whole family will delight in. Great fun. **** I never really thought this was the best movie...; Toy Story is a good movie. It has good characters and a decent story. But is it really worth the hype? Yes, it's the first fully computer animated movie ever made and that's very impressive. For that reason alone, it will stand out in history. But I certainly never really thought it was the brilliant classic everyone else thought it was. Its animation is great but the story suffers from major pacing issues. There are entire moments of the movie right in the middle that bore me every time and don't stop boring me until I get to the film's climax, when it picks up again. A lot of trimming should have been done in the middle. Toy Story is good but its sequels are a lot better. So is it bad? No. But it's not brilliant. If this were 2-D, I doubt it would receive this high praise. One of the greatest animated movies ever created!; I don't want to be biast, but Toy Story is one of the greatest animated movies ever created. I first watched this movie at about 2-4 years old, and I loved this movie. The storyline is excellently written, and always gets me laughing! The animation in this movie is incredible! As a computer animated film it was well ahead of its era (at least I think). Also, it was the first feature length film that was fully animated, and to this day is one of the best. With the success of this film it was no wonder they made a sequel, one that i enjoyed a lot! Also, I have heard that Pixar have announced Toy Story 3, and it will be a movie I will definitely see! They Don't Call it \"Playing\" for Nothing.; The opening scene says it all. Film-making begins in early childhood, as children use their toys to create little scenes (or movies if you will). The word \"play\" when used to describe such activity indeed derived from the movies of another era, plays. Or perhaps the other way around. Either way, the point of this film is to show that creating a film and playing with toys are virtually the same thing. So the film is basically about itself. A play about playing. This is exactly the type of multi-layered construction that I believe subconsciously challenges and nurtures our kids' minds. Teaching a child (or adult!) to think on more than one level at a time is simply a gift. It should also be applauded that it's all substance and no fluff. Other animation teams have inundated their films with meaningless pop culture gags, camp, and nostalgic irony. Not to mention an abundance of toilet humor. Music by the great Randy Newman instead of the Village People. None of the mindless pandering to adults here, either, yet we are included in the fun by being subtly reminded of our own play days. Barrel of Monkeys. Potato Heads. In fact there is a strong undercurrent theme here as the classic cowboy toy is threatened by the flashy new space man who is obviously being pushed on kids via a relentless marketing campaign. We 30-somethings must root for Woody. It's Wal-mart vs. our favorite mom-n-pop corner store. These Pixar guys are brilliant, and I believe they will be revered someday as perhaps the most important influence in all of filmdom during the turn of this century's period. There is no more sure thing than a Pixar offering. Always compelling, engaging, intelligent and abstract. And this one is the best. Perfect film; Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only concern is easy when you can replace the new birthday and Christmas toys already there. Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, such a birthday, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new toy buzz lightyear. Competition buzz on the edge of the bed to hide, but accidentally pushes him out the window boil runs Woody, and Woody and buzz find a few other expulsion leaves them with no choice but to return her home. But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence. Typically, animation, Intelligence, humor and children's humor, the same mixture (Ice Age, monsters Inc, Bugs life, toy story is being used since it's easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out given how. I just watched it again and new twists on the formula than a little comes out. Each one is clearer and there seems to be more references in the background etc. However, it is still very funny and deserve credit for being the first of a successful formula. The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement. To the shores really what the main story is fun, but in terms of character development. When confronted with the truth of his status as a toy and nothing more against him, the conflict between buzz and Woody cartoon character, this is taken deeper,,, buzz the turmoil is very real. Two powerful support customers, despite the players a real depth. In fact, more rows, but may not have the funniest lines. 'Adult' Intelligence most of the potato head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky Dog. Funny and very used. In fact, the majority of the humor will go over kids heads, and the plot on the right. Looking back, this movie really must have helped sales so much in the movie toy companies on a sarcastic edge I feel. The marketing department behind this film it's not that hard to see standing rubbing his hands. However, the actual product quickly I forgot about this great fun. The voice work is excellent and the characters the players match. Allen woody and buzz for the B-type as he has a voice Hanks movie is good. His usual Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (), reckless, and all other support roles for adults turns out to be really good and probably the favorite characters. In general, this (if not more) as a classic film that will appeal to children as adults. A good plot and a very sharp short command already make time fly by. The only downside to want to go out and buy the damn things children! Best Disney ever; Finally a Disney movie which isn't moralistic but just fun to watch. Also it doesn't have the boring \"sing-along-songs\" so this movie is also a perfect movie for anybody about 10 years and (much) older. I really liked the computer-generated graphics because the characters moved very smoothly, something which can't be done the original way. More of these masterpieces in the future please and I will really like Disney at last, but dont't make it to moralistic and musical. That this movie is above all the other Disney -movies in the IMDB top 250 is proof of that. A wonderful family movie!; What a wonderful movie for the whole family to enjoy!  I can hardly wait for Toy Story 2 to come out! Great As The Other One!; This Toy Story is as great as the second one! I saw the second one first and it was really cool! Best Pixar movie to date!; Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (\"I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout\"). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox. If it wasn't for Toy Story coming together so well, computer animation would have taken a step backwards.; 9.4 For years, Disney reigned as the superior animation studio. Although there were others creating animated feature length films, Disney has always been a household name, known for their experience and ability to create an emotional and entertaining experience out of hand-drawn images, and original, composed music. In 1995, Pixar Animation Studios released Toy Story. While it wasn't the first time that we've seen CGI, or Computer Generated Imagery, it was the first fully CGI film. What a disaster this film could have been. And thank God that it wasn't. If it was, then it would have done more damage to CGI animation than otherwise. The film was distributed by Disney, but created by Pixar. It had no musicals. No frames were hand drawn, everything was done by computer. It had a lot to live up to. Sticking the Disney name on the film meant that audiences expected not a single drop of mediocrity out of it. Thankfully, as we all know, Toy Story was a success. The animation in the film isn't the augmented reality kind. CGI effects aren't added to real life shots, everything is animated. This gives the film some room to breathe. The lighting, surfaces and other effects all look good, in their own context. It would have been a huge step backwards for computer animation if Toy Story didn't come together so well, and successfully put up that fourth wall. But besides the animation, what brings to film to life is the voice- acting, story, and presentation. It's a story about toys who are conscious and self-aware. However, they all follow a strict code, where they do not allow humans to know of their life and intelligence. It's not an epic tale. Two toys are lost and have to get back home. But what carries the film are the characters. Every toy has a distinct personality, and the voice actors are great in their roles. This is one of the strong points in Toy Story. The film's presentation is great, too. It went totally contradictory of what Disney means to people. There are no musicals, but the music, although used sparingly, has a great effect nonetheless. The direction is of the more typical Hollywood style, and different from the typical Disney movie. It is entertaining to exist in the toys' world, and when they venture off a couple of blocks, you feel like you have traveled a long distance. Toy Story could have been such a disaster. If it wasn't for everything coming together so well, especially the animation, characters and voice acting, computer animation would have taken a step backwards. Its greatest strength are the toys. They are amongst the better characters in film. Toy Story not only proved that animated films can be done in a different formula than the already great Disney one, but that computer animation was here to stay. It was a pleasure to the eyes, and a pleasure to the Andy inside all of us. The cartoon that started it all.; I am not a kid but a kid at heart. Toy Story is one of the best animated movies around. This is the most creative movie for kids and adults. Toy Story 2 is better story than the first one, but equally imaginative in computer graphics. Tears....; Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library. The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in 1937 lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Awesome; A very sweet and fun movie. TOY STORY has great computer animation. A simple yet well told story is also added as well. The voice overs are top notch and everyone gets a fair share in this movie. PIXAR has done a good job placing itself on the map. Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle. Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel. A good rent. Classic Animation!!; Toy Story was the first fully animated movie that released in 1995. Starring Tom Hanks as Woody who brings life to the cowboy pull- string doll. Buzz Lightyear, played by Tim Allen brought the right attitude for the newest addition to Andy's (John Morris) toy collection. The story takes us back to the day where we played with toys and used our imaginations to create our own stories. When Andy would leave the room the toys would come to life. A week before Andy's birthday, with his family moving, he is given a party to spend with friends before they leave. The toys plot a way to discover Andy's new presents. After the party the other toys discovered Buzz is one of the presents Andy's receives before he leaves. The main theme of the story to me is \"friendship.\" It's a great story relaying the message to be kind to everyone because you never really know when you might need them and your enemy could be your best friend in the end. After all, \"You've got a friend in me.\" Woody doesn't want to lose top spot as favorite toy so he plots to get rid of Buzz. He starts with a master plan that leaves the both of them in a situation to help each other to get home. The rich colors and 3D animation gives the movie a more realistic feeling as if it were drawn. It is the lighting, modeling, computer graphics and animations are what bring this movie to life. The shading of certain objects, cracks or spills could be the difference between a human look or manufactured. The lighting had to be hard to create the film. They had some dramatic moody lights in Sid's room, flashlight stuff, daylight, bright sun for all sorts of different kinds of environments. When they add light it gives more a visual interest for viewers and hide some flaw in animation. Andy's room gives a sense of a happy, friendly and safe place because the brightness in the room gives that affect. This is an overall great film introducing a new way of animations! A Toy in the making of another and more toys; Excellent voice match to character in movie. Could have more art and less same images repeat. Pixar is now faster than ever; 1995 a slower speed for animated film. Will watch again, but not over and over again, consecutively. Liked it on Facebook, happy go lucky and not afraid to be bold. Don't understand the likes and dislikes but willing to accept all criticism. My own personal review may be liked or may be disliked. The clearness and accurate manner for beautiful taste in dual role models for example Sid the evil kid whom abuses toys and Andy the kid who doesn't like to play rough. However, Sid's sister is quite an opposite to Sid as well; she being a girl and has a love for tea parties with her closest doll Friends. The jokes and laughter in \"Toy Story\" is what made this turn of a century animated film a door-buster into the the first \"digital\" animated films in history. Of course, one does grow old and the story is great passed on to your children in just about any house hold! Toy Story; The story is about toys. The boy who named Andy has toys and enjoys playing with them. To be surprised, their toys can talk and act freely. Nobody of human know the fact. Woody who is Andy's cowboy toy spends a good time, however, Andy's new toy appear for Woddy. The toy's name is Buzz Lightyear. Woody and Buzz fight all the time and loses sight of their family and toys. They tries a lot of ways to meet their family and toys. The film is a long film by Pixar Animation Studious. The genre of the movie is animation, comedy and fantasy. It has dialogue and colors. It has sound effect and it is good to use the way of music. I like the scene that Woody and Buzz success in getting into a car that Andy rides. The film can be enjoyed by only children but also adults. You've got a friend in me; \"Reach for the sky\"! The opening statement of Woody (Hanks) a toy cowboy during a boys playtime. A statement that proves to be ironic when he later looks up at a toy from space, Buzz Lightyear (Allen). Woody's owner is growing older and Woody struggles to accept the change as Buzz becomes Andy's new favourite toy. Leading from the once strong leader into a bout of jealousy and even malice as he tries to take Buzz out of the picture. Woody is then separated from Andy via a fight with Buzz and has to find a way home. Further change occurs as Woody is forced to align with Buzz to escape the toy antagonist Sid. It takes 3/4 of the movie for Woody to finally change his ways, and work with Buzz for the final great escape. Woody's journey from leader to outcast to redemption is intriguing to watch unfold. His final monologue with Sid was beautifully written as the toy out wits the boy. The whole irony of his story is that a child's mind is fleeting and 10 minutes of playing with Buzz and Woody would have been in the game again. For me it is Buzz that follows the greater path of change. Noble and confident throughout mostly due to being under the illusion he is an actual space ranger. Kudos to the writer who decided to take a toy from this world and make him believe he is real! Simple but incredibly compelling. Buzz's final realisation that he is a toy is arm breaking for him but heartbreaking for us. For a family movie Buzz's breakdown is surprising and well delivered and the journey back to being he hero has Buzz literally \"Reaching for the sky\". With us the viewers figuratively as we are up there with them cheering the final events. Woody and Buzz's journey home is supported by a cast of toys, each with a filled out personality. Loyal Slinky being one of my favourites, always reluctant to turn on his buddy Woody like the others. It's the direction of John Lasseter that puts us into this world. When Woody shouts \"You are a toy\". It's John speaking to us. From the beginning the camera is at ground level. We are not supposed to be a child watching his toys come to life but an actual toy, low level shots panning up throughout give a feel to the vastness of a toys world. We are right there through each playtime, adventure, triumph and failure and by the end Buzz may be flying but we are falling for these toys, in style. The story and characters are a success but the triumph is the medium in which the story is told. Through 3d animation, never before seen feature length. The Pixar animators made a bedroom and a pizza planet truly realistic. They brought toys to life in movement and texture. But most astonishing of all, they made us care for a bunch of 3d shapes put together through countless hours of rendering in a computer. The result is a metaphor for change, not just in the story itself and it's characters but in the medium it is told. The great change from 2d to 3d animation which is now common place for feature animation. This movie is a game changer for cinema and animation alike. Walt Disney and co did it in 1938. 54 years later John Lasseter and co did it again. The possibilities for 3d animation in film are Infinite, and Beyond...? this movie is awesome!the humor never bores!; i remember when this movie came out in 1995. i was seven at the time. i have loved it since day 1. actors such as tom hanks and tim allen bring sparkle to the show. they are both hillarious as woody and buzz. this movie is directed at both kids and adults. the humor never goes flat and it is never cheesy or corny. if you are a fan of tom hanks and tim allen or you just want a good laugh, than you shoud definitely watch this movie. you will not regret it. ********** out of **********. In my top 25; Although i like to think the 3rd is the best, everyone should respect this film, the first feature film to be animated, and still holds up as one of the best! And not to mention being in the top 250, thats a accomplishment! this film will forever stay with me as a Nostalgic relic, i only hope that newer generations will remember this film as i do. I still like to think of this as my favorite film of all time, if anyone was to ask me, usually because i can't think of one i'd rather be proud of saying i love it so much, or maybe i'm a total hipster? This film for me is a 8/10, not as perfect as the 3rd, but good enough for any Pixar fan. An Entertaining Accomplishment; This movie is one of the real achievements of the modern age, and a real measure of how good is the fact that you quickly forget your amazement at the computer animation and just get the story. We signed up to buy it the first day they had pre-orders and have enjoyed it since - and we didn't have kids then! A rare combination of many things that can be enjoyed by everyone.  I can't believe anyone would rate it less than a 9! A MUST HAVE! It's a Happy Movie! Ya there's spoilers; I put this computer animated movie just on the cusp of being great. You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time...8.7/10 This DVD is part of the Toy Story 2 Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages. Quality animation always looks good on the big screen and this looks wonderful. This is a Buy and Hold to flesh out your collection to include 'Happy Movies' as my daughter puts it. The DVD is a solid 9/10 Toy Story; A wonderfully sculpted piece of filmmaking. It brings us into a new age and may this new age have films that are just as delightfully witty as this pleasing film for all ages. The laughs are constant, there's great creativity at work, from the artists and the numerous talents who lend their voices. Hanks, Allen, Rickles and Ermey stand out in their performances. An unmissable film; From our first sight of Woody until his happy face disappears off of the screen the makers of this film keep audiences worldwide glued to the screen with eager anticipation. The films unlikely scenario where talking toys battle to save a fellow toys life is amazingly gripping and a \"must see\" which will keep the whole family (yes even the teenageers) amused. The more mature audience will recognise the \"spoofy\"side to the movie. This is most noticeable when plastic soldiers (who mimic the actors in \"Who saves wins\") jump off  bannisters with miniature parachutes and talk to each through baby monitering systems.!!! In conclusion, TOY STORY is one of the most thought out films in the industry as props and scenerycan not just be found lying around and everything had to be individually designed, crafted and computerised The Best Animated Movie of All Time; 1995's Toy Story is a work of pure imagination. It covers topics of fantasy, friendship and jealousy. It also contains relatable characters which shines out compared to other animated films. The actors were perfectly cast (Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz - the list goes on...) and the intricate plot can be compared to some of the best movies ever. I think everyone in the world has seen Toy Story, but if you haven't, it's a must see. Its by far superior to its two sequels, but they are decent. Not only is it a great film, it is historically significant, as it was the first fully 3D animated film. You HAVE TO SEE THIS... J My favorite film as a kid and remains a classic today; As a kid, I remember watching the first two Toy Story films frequently and collecting all the characters from the movie. I found out that it was the very first computer-animated film about two years ago and assumed that's why the movie is still so popular. Woody and Buzz are what made the film what it was then and today and were my favorite characters. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is where Woody and Buzz are launched in the air from the rocket and Buzz frees himself to fly into Andy's toy box. The film remains a classic and always will be to me. I also cannot wait for the third movie to come out June 18, 2010 because I'll be the first in line. A resounding success; Pixar knocks it out of the park with its first feature film, about friendship, jealousy and the capriciousness of privileged white kids in a society of disposability. A clever, sharp and imaginative screenplay expertly voiced by a stellar cast (I would give this 5/10 just for casting Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head) keeps the swiftly moving story engaging throughout, flagging only a bit when self- deluded toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is briefly depressed. The film hops from one great set-piece to the next with head-spinning speed that leaves me marveling at how simple director John Lasseter and the team of animators make it look to bring these toys to life with just a few touches of individuality. Every viewer will probably have their favorite parts. Back when I first saw the movie upon its initial release, mine was the new-age toys who worship the Claw; upon recent viewing, I think it is \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" rendition of evil neighbor Sid's bedroom. It's hard to remember now that Pixar has proved so successful that there was real doubt about whether its style of computer-graphics animation would be embraced by audiences -- kudos to Pixar for proving the doubters wrong. Very good!; As much as I enjoyed this film, I think the sequel was even better. One can certainly relate to Woody's jealousy of Buzz, and cheer when they've found the perfect best friend. I loved it when all the toys put evil Sid in his place, and I'm even happier that Sid wasn't in the sequel! Best of all is that Woody and Buzz never give up. Great animation and voice-overs! Exciting; Toy story is a 1995 American computer-animated adventure buddy comedy film produced by Pixar Animetion Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures, directed by John Lasseter at his directorial debut. Toy story was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first theatrical film produced by Pixar. In the film, toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present. A group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy, are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother and his sister are preparing to move the following week. The toy's leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Woody organized the other toys. Andy gets an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear as a birthday present. He believes that he is an actual space ranger. What happen to Andy's toys next? The characters have individuality. The picture on the screen is colorful, so I think the film is very cute. I am excited because I think about what happen next and what Andy's toy do next. I love the film's view of the world. Everyone enjoys the film, regardless of age or sex. I want you to watch the film. The one that started it all; In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In 1995, they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be 100% made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history. The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having \"souls\" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was. Rating: 9,5/10 The Beginning of a Classic Trilogy.; Toy Story came out on 1995 and it got 2 more sequels Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3. Story: Woody, a traditional pull-string talking cowboy, has long enjoyed a place of honor as the favorite among six-year-old Andy's menagerie of toys. Quick to calm their anxieties about being replaced by newer arrivals, Woody finds his own confidence shaken, and his status as top toy in jeopardy, upon the arrival of Buzz Lightyear, simply the coolest space action figure ever made. Woody plots to get rid of Buzz, but things backfire and he finds himself lost in the outside world with Buzz as his only companion. Joining forces to find their way home, the two rivals set out on an adventure that lands them in the clutches of Sid, a sadistic neighborhood kid who is notorious for dismembering and reassembling \"mutant\" toys in his bedroom. As \"guests\" of Sid and his dog, Scud, the two fugitive toys forge a genuine friendship and learn that only through mutual trust and respect do they have any chance of survival. Toy Story is one of the best animation movies ever made full of laughs and drama with a great cast voicing the stars and a great script and direction it's easy to say that Toy Story is still one of the best movies ever made and for sure a Classic. An amazing family film; Toy Story is a timeless classic. Probably the most genuine, innocent, simplistic yet powerful attempt to create a children film which appeals both adults and kids alike. It is the story of how two rival 'living' toys - a old western cowboy toy (Woody) and action figure of a space commander (Buzz Lightyear) become best friends under some dangerous circumstances. There are bunch of numerals toys like Mr. Potato, a Barbie, a magnifying toy, a truck, alien toys and many more. The film is crafted so well that within some few minutes of the film, you are intrigued to it. It is a fascinating film, with amazing characterization. The toys are so believable that you feel close to them. You feel cherished when Allan and his company make a spoiled brat kid Sid (who loves blowing up toys) realize how important is to save toys which bring back the memories of childhood. I must say the script is effortless and very well written. Music by Randy Newman is also great. One striking thing in this film are its sound effects and CGI which are considered ground-breaking for a 1995 film. Overall, the film is highly recommended. Not only for children, but for everyone who love cherishing the childhood memories - the lovely Toys. Toy Story and the Imagination; The film Toy Story is an animation film that changed the movie game with its technological advances used to create this bold, colorful computerized animation. Toy Story is about a boy named Andy and his love for his toys. Andy's favorite toys have a huge secret that he is not aware of, they are actually alive and become real when no one is around. Andy has a favorite toy cowboy named Woody who is the Sheriff and leader of all the other toys. Woody pride himself on being Andy's favorite toy, but that title is challenged when Andy has a birthday party and receives a new space ranger toy Buzz Light Year. In the scene that introduces Buzz Light Year, it is kind of symbolic that the new toy may be a replacement for the old cowboy Woody. As the kids rush in the room the day of Andy's birthday party Woody is thrown under the bed, and Buzz Light Year is placed on the bed in Woody's spot. Time goes by as Randy Newman's song \"You got a friend in me\" plays as the soundtrack during various scenes as Andy becomes more involved with Buzz, eventually pushing Woody to the background. The lyrics to the song could be considered an ironic montage to the mood that Woody feels during these scenes, because he is lonely and feels replaced. Buzz on the other hand is indulging in the admiration that he receives from Andy. The soundtrack to this movie as awesome, because the lyrics of the songs played like, \"you got a friend in me\", \"strange things\", and \"pop goes the weasel\". Those songs can replace the dialogue in the scenes and the audience will still be able to follow on. At Pizza Planet there is some tension between the two toys Buzz and Woody, which causes them to end up with the neighbor kid Sid, who is known to destroy his toys. Once the movie reaches this climax the characters positions change. Woody and Buzz are forced to reconcile and work together in the quest to return home. The special effects and graphics used in this animation were phenomenal. The camera angles, digital character movements, even facial expressions, helped bring the toys in the film to life. Although this film theme was surrounded by the dynamic relationship between alpha toys Woody and Buzz Light Year. The supporting characters, the relationships displayed between Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, the comedic scenes with Rex the Dinosaur and Slinky the Dog made the film more entertaining and realistic. Toy Story is a must see film for all children who has a love for toys. Watching this film will enhance a new found respect for the creativity of children's imagination. Great film about toys; Toy Story is the first fully computer-animated film. It tells the story of a cowboy toy named Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) who is jealous when a new toy arrives, Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen). Buzz thinks he's a space ranger, and is eventually \"disposed of\" accidentally by Woody. (Woody had only meant to knock Buzz behind a dresser) Woody and Buzz eventually become friends, and had it not been for that friendship, Buzz would have been . . well, I'll let you see it yourself. Toy Story, while a great film, is the only Pixar to not be among my Top 10. But still, I think it's worth watching. It may not be log enough, but not all good movies have to be 2-3 hours long. My Score: 9/10 One or two?; I have no idea which is the best, as depending on my mood either one suits me. This for my money is best for its darker aspects, Sid, Buzz and Woody's rivalry etc.       This film is not only groundbreaking with effects, but raised the bar with its smart script and proper characters. Deserves all the praise. Animation's \"Citizen Kane\"; A technological breakthrough (the first entirely digital animated feature), John Lasseter's comedy would be astonishing if only for the realism of the film's design. But Lasseter and his writers (there are six others who get credit) have fashioned a screenplay simple in story line but complex in structure and emotion; it's also rollickingly funny with a spate of memorable lines that have real depth to them. As two beloved toys vying for their owner's affection, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are splendid--they join forces with Lasseter's formidable crew to make their characters come completely alive. You feel as if you know them thoroughly by the conclusion and are moved by the life lessons they've learned, lessons you would want any child to learn. In addition to the main performers, the voice cast is perfectly suited to the toys they're called upon to represent: there's Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, the late Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex, the timid dinosaur, Annie Potts as Bo Peep and John Ratzenberger as Hamm, the talking pig. Laurie Metcalf is the voice of the child's mother. A supreme accomplishment, you can watch it over and over again and still find something new every time--it's animation's \"Citizen Kane\". The one that started it all with Pixar; In 1995 a man named John Lasseter set up his own company called Pixar which was also owned by the late Steve Jobs. So their first film was of course Toy Story. Everyone has seen this movie before its probably the best Pixar movie to date since the mid 1990s. The story is about Woody the cowboy(voiced by Tom Hanks)who is a toy along with many other toys that come to life when no one is in the room. All of the toys are owned by Andy a young boy who lives with his mom and his sister. So on the eve of Andy's birthday he ends up getting a new toy,the Buzz Lightyear toy which is a very popular toy who is a space ranger. So when Woody is introduced to Buzz Lightyear(voiced by Tim Allen)Woody ends up being jealous of him and he would do anything to be the center of attention again. But when a rough kid who lives next door accidentally gets Woody and Buzz out of a cash rending machine its up to Woody and Buzz to escape Sid's house. Overall this was a very original authentic masterpiece. The story is very good,the music is great,the charcthers are engaging and the whole set up is fantastic. Its a shame it didn't win an Oscar but at least the 2010 prequel to it won Best Animated Feature beating the likes of Tangled and How To Train Your Dragon. 9/10 Best Toy Story Movie; This movie is funny, hilarious, humorous1 It makes the whole wide world wanna laugh! This movie is so funny, you'd laugh your butt off! I liked it how Sid scared his sister but messing up her toys. I wish I can do what he does to the Animal Crossing players! They make me sick because they suck more than Justin Bieber. Also, it's funny how Woody murdered Buzz! Also Bo Peep reminds me of Princess Peach from the Super Mario series. She should have appeared in the other Toy Story movies. I can't believe they screwed up on Toy Story 3, one of the worst Toy Story movies ever! I hope they don't ever screw up Toy Story 4, which comes out next year. Amazing; This movie has something for everyone in the family. It is funny, has action, has a life story, and the characters will touch your heart. These are not just toys, this is a friendship, siblings, relationship or just a way of thinking sometimes. It is a real story on so many levels. It is a heart-warming story about a child and his toys and the relationships between the toys. In Toy Story, the two main characters are Buzz and Woody. At first Buzz and Woody can not stand each other and the two of them fight for the love of their owner Andy. Throughout the story these two show that fighting, arguing, and not getting along will get you no where in life and finally come together to help each other get back to their owner so that they can get back to their home. After all the trials and tribunals these two go through they become the best of friends and go on for two more movies to be a heroic team. Great Movie; All kids should watch this movie. It is very Funny. All the characters remind me of how good times growing up. The animation was before its time. All the toys are very courageous and dominating. Most animation movies could not keep my attention around this time, but this movie most definitely kept my eyes glued to the screen and my bottom in my theater chair. Approving each other; I watched this movie when I was an elementary student for the first time. That time, I only thought that toys are cute, or something like that. However, this film contains moral meaning, and I have not realize it until I become an adult. This film tells us the importance of things. These days, people have many things. It means we are rich. However, it's only the abundance of objective things. In toy story, a boy with many toys but does not have heart to treat toys dearly is suppose to be punished. This suggests the situation of modern society, and reminds us the importance to treat things carefully. Another point that I like in this film is, the growth of the cowboy. When he meets Buzz for the first time, he did not accept Buzz, because he couldn't understand everything about Buzz. Moreover, his position was taken over because of Buzz's appearance. However, he learns the importance of understanding other people, through the adventure to return to home. Also, Buzz finally comes to understand Woody. This means that we can understand each other even if the existence is in contrast. Good and groundbreaking; Good and groundbreaking computer animation graphics movie that delivers but does not reach a higher level due to the animation itself not having the \"warmth\" of the drawing style classic Disney animations.Still,the computer style here is very promising and quite impressive.Good story and script.A good solid start in a new trend in animation production.Very good voice acting.Only for fans of kids movies..... The Largest Part Of My Childhood Put On Screen.; With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. \"Toy Story\" was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises &amp; confidence. How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history. I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling &amp; technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals &amp; entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks &amp; Tim Allen, and almost immediately think \"Toy Story\". As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then. Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, \"Toy Story\" is that proof. 10/10. Toy Story was like the Snow White of 1995; I remember going and seeing Toy Story when I was 5 years old at the movies. I fell completely in love with it! It had great animation, great characters and a great story! My favorite character was the Slinky Dog played by my favorite comedian the late Jim Varney (God rest his soul). I loved it towards the end when Slinky is trying to get Woody and Buzz into the moving van and the others toys in the moving van pull on him so hard that he begins to stretch out! That was hilarious! I also liked it when Slinky says Come on PotatoHead! If Woody says it's all right well darn it it's good enough for me! Woody has never stared us wrong before! With Toy Story PIXAR showed us what Computer Animation could do to tell a great story! Toy Story like Snow White it an animated classic that'll go on forever! I'm hoping one day to get a job at PIXAR and I think Walt Disney would of been proud of what they've done with Toy Story and Computer Animation. God bless you Pixar Animation Studios! Great fun for anyone; Toy Story is definitely a film that a kid should watch before they are a teen. Its adventure and great sense of humour is appealing to adult audiences as well, and the atmosphere is brilliant. This really is a Toy Story. The plot is indeed quite simple, and it would have to be for a classic family. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks)is a toy 'sheriff' doll, owned by a young boy called Andy. Woodys Toy life couldn't as Andy loves him a lot, but as Andy's birthday party arises tension fills the bedroom with each toy living in fear of being replaced. Everything goes well till the last birthday present is opened.. enter Buzz Lightyear! I would be criminal to tell you the rest of the story, but as far as humour and adventure are concerned, this film impresses in both categories. The toys different personalities really contrast and make you laugh, from the smart-chat of Mr. Potatoe head, to Slinky who is Woodys best toy friend. Its so easy to follow this film - the plot and characters are easy to watch the computer graphics are top notch. Compared to modern day CGI kids films, this stands out purely because of its innocence - a simple story, theirs no techno-babble, and its really fun. This truly is the film of the Nineties! Toy Story; This was the very first computer animated film from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation, it is just excellent. It is showing what happens when the young Andy leaves his room, his toys come to life! Woody the cowboy is Andy's favourite toy, and looks after all the other toys (and he is a very good Tom Hanks voicing). Unfortunately on Andy's early birthday party he gets a new favourite toy, Buzz Lightyear the space ranger (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody obviously gets jealous and both him and Buzz end up lost, and then in evil Sid's room. For a kid, Sid is a good villain. Woody and Buzz are now trying to find a way to get back to their owner. Also starring Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Jim Varney as Slinky, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Morris as Andy, Scream 2's Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom, Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Army Sarge and Jeff Pidgeon as Green Aliens.With recognisable toys for every generation, and the Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song \"You've Got a Friend\" and Oscar nominated music by Randy Newman, this is a great family film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and a Special Achievement Award (fior creation of a feature-length computer-animated film), it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, along with the sequel, both was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons, and it was number 40 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding! Great start to a great trilogy; The beginning of a sensational trilogy , I think this is the weakest of the trilogy , more does not mean it is bad , quite the contrary , it's great movie, who would say that dolls speakers would so sure , the history of this is great , it's funny , the double Woody and Buzz is very good at the beginning Woody has envy him to be best friends, Sid movie villain is cruel , you feel a giant hatred for him , we have other characters , the soundtrack is excellent, the voice work is amazing , the brilliant Tom Hanks who is the voice of Woody , Woody scene trying to escape from Sid's house is very good and fun (remember some prison movies) , Toy Story is a classic animation, and deserves to be seen by all. Note 8.8 Lost a vote cuz it was too short!!; I want to get the recently re-released anniversary edition because this is a must have for any collection, be it animation or just good movies! What an absolutely funny, original and mesmerizing movie! I mean, come on, what kid in the history of the world doesn't, at some time, think their toys are alive. That's why girls talk to Barbie or have tea parties with all the toys, and guys chat with GI Joe and make believe the hot wheels can talk! Let's not even bring up our puppets! Pixar and Disney not only knock our socks off with the most amazing computer generated animation, but the writers of this story hit a home-run and totally captured the whimsical innocence of what we all knew was going on when we were kids; that our toys are alive and only want to be played with and cherished. In addition, the superb voice acting by a cast of actors that obviously still remember being a kid, only gives this instant classic the status of being the \"Gold Standard\" to which all others in this category will have to be judged. My only complaint and why I only give 9 out of 10, is that it is far, far too short, running 1 hour and 20 minutes! I know I'm selfish, but I want MORE!! I could and would have watched 2 or 3 hours of this! But that's why there's a Toy Story 2!! Wonderful animated feature...; TOY STORY is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. It goes along with TOY STORY 2, TARZAN, A BUG'S LIFE, THE LION KING and CHICKEN RUN as some of my favorite animated features. Tom Hank s voices Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll owned by a boy named Andy who is the most-played toy until a space ranger, Buzz (Tim Allen) comes along and Woody is not good friends with them. But one day later, a mean toy-hating man who owns a collection of mutant toys and tries to threaten Buzz, and it is up to Woody to save Buzz with the help of the mutants before it's too late to escape to Andy's new house. The sequel is better than the original, but TOY STORY is a good movie. **** An Instant Classic!; After a few short films and no major recognition-in 1991, Pixar set out to start the ball rolling for computer-animated entertainment and in 1995 unleashed not just a mere film but a work of art. An instant classic when first released...Toy Story went on to earn nearly $400 million worldwide and capture the hearts of children and adults alike with its unforgettable characters, magical musical score, hilarious script and the classic quote \"To infinity and beyond\". Woody (Tom Hanks) is an old-fashioned pull - string cowboy doll living a life of luxury as the favourite toy of a young boy named Andy. Surrounded by a colourful cast of characters - such as the cynical Mr. Potato Head, the wisecracking Piggy bank Hamm and Woody's brown-nosing second-in-command Slinky Dog - Woody seems something of a king. However, when a new toy arrives on the scene-a high tech spaceman action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Woody suddenly loses his popularity. But this toy comes with a surreal extra feature - he thinks he's the real Buzz Lightyear!! In the effort of removing Buzz as Andy's favourite toy-both toys are swept out of their home, and into the outside world where they unite reluctantly in friendship for an adventure home. Toy Story; This movie came out around the time I was born. And I especially remember watching this and Toy Story 2 (the sequel) like every day. And I remember getting sucked in to a world I'd like to live in. A world were my toys came to life. In my mind, this movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250 list. This is a movie everyone can enjoy. This is definitely Disney Pixar's best movie. Although Monster's Inc., The Incredibles, Cars, Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, and Meet the Robinsons are great. It does not come close to the magic Toy Story brings. If you have not yet seen Toy Story, where the hell have you been? It's a fantastic movie, and my favorite. So if you haven't seen it yet...Then what are you waiting for....GO!! yup; The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy). The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing. I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had. Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made  something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.' Not only for children under 10 !; I saw this really cool animated movie and I really liked it. Buzz LIGHTYEAR and WOODY didn´t get along much in that movie, but together they mastered their way out of danger. I am really looking forward seeing part two of this film. Really good animation, with almost real looking sequences, the scene with the rocket and the remote-control buggy, when BUZZ and WOODY chasing the van is really fast´n furious. Check it out, it´s worth watching it. I thought it was George CLOONEY, as the voice of BUZZ, it sounded similar, but it was Tim ALLEN. Solid entertainment for the kids...; Great animation, great voice cast. A wonderful film for children, but as an adult, I thought there was a total lack of any good jokes. All the songs seemed unnecessary and the story was pretty weak for a film so hailed by adult critics. But the 3D animation is really groundbreaking, my jaw hit the ground several times, and that's what this film is all about. ****(out of five) A Triumph For Disney!; \"Toy Story\" has been said to be the first great fully computer animated feature ever.  And I must agree.  Computer animation has been used before, in movies like \"Tron.\"  But only in \"Toy Story\" has it been used with such great effect.  Seeing animation like this is impressive.  Truly cinematic history was made with this movie!  The technology may be improving past the level it had achieved when \"Toy Story\" was made.  But you just can't forget this milestone! It's okay but over hyped; I saw Toy Story in theaters when it first came out and it was alright but I wasn't impressed. Over the years I've come to dislike it rather than feeling neutral toward it. The concept of the movie wasn't new to me because I had already seen the Jim Henson film The Christmas Toy which was basically the same but instead of Woody the cowboy being the main character it was a tiger plush toy named Rigby and I prefer puppetry over CG anyway. Given that this movie was made in the early days of CG the people look really weird and fake, almost creepy, even the good characters. It seems to mainly focus on the petty squabbles between the jealous cowboy and the delusional spaceman. While the film has a few jokes the kids might not get, my over all impression is that the whole story lacks depth. You could maybe read between the lines and infer things but the movie glosses over most of the more serious stuff to keep the mood light. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable either. Toy Story; Total Classic Disney movie, One of the best ever made in my opinion! Long loved by adults and children alike! Its a great animation about....(well if the title didn't give it away) Toys, And their adventures while in the care of Andy, a young boy who's favourite toy used to be sheriff Woddy (voiced by Tom Hanks)a cowboy doll, until one day on his birthday he receives a space doll, Buzz lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) Woody isn't too happy when he finds he has been replaced by a space toy and immediately holds a grudge over Buzz. Woody is surprised to find out that this 'Space Toy' doesn't even know he is a toy, And wouldn't believe it if you told him. Fed up over being replaced Woody tries to dispose of Buzz, the plan fails of course...but it starts Buzz and Woody on an adventure of a lifetime...or 'toytime'...which eventually brings them close together! Must see for all Disney Fans! Infinity and beyond from Disney and Pixar!; Disney and Pixar studios team up and brought us an imaginative adventure story about a little boy named Andy who loves playing with his toys, with his best friend being a cowboy doll named Woody. However, when Andy and not body else is looking, the toys come to life. Woody is the leader of the toys in Andy's room, which include a Mr. Potato Head, Slinky the Dog, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Pig and Bo-Peep the girl doll. However, when Andy's get new toy space ranger Buzz Lightyear for his birthday, Buzz takes the place of Woody of being leader of the toys and Andy's new best friend. Brewing with jealously, Woody attempts to get rid of Buzz, but both ended up lost outside of Andy's house. As a result, they must find their way back to Andy's house before they move - first trying to get through Andy's weird neighbor and toy torturer Sid. This is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation - very detailed and realistic. The story is full of surprises and adventure, from Woody and Buzz getting lost in a pizza shop to them trying to break loose out of Sid's house to get back to Andy's. The movie is also filled with comedy; you will have to watch the movie to appreciate and understand the humor only live toys could make. And, there are toe-tapping songs you would learn to love including Randy Newman's opening song \"You've Got a Friend in Me.\" While this movie's plot is full of non-stop fun and adventure, making every moment exciting and entertaining, the film also concentrates on friendship and teamwork and overcoming all odds. While I mostly enjoyed this movie, I wished that Woody was not made out to be hated on so much by the other toys after Woody's jealous behavior towards Buzz. I thought this takes away at Woody's hero status too much especially for his first movie. But overall, this is one of Disney's best work, which will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination. Also, hands down to a great voice cast: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts and Jim Varney. Grade B+ One of the great movies of all time; I enjoy watching this movie over and over. It is structured so carefully, I can pick up from any point and be immersed. I love reading about how it was made just as much as watching it, and collect books about Pixar and the making of these films. But as much as I enjoy the craft and history of Toy Story, I also think it deserves credit for its influence. It's just too bad that all the filmmakers that think they're working from the Toy Story template are missing the main ingredient: story. Pixar worked and reworked this script for years and refused to quit until they got it right. Woody and Buzz, Pizza Planet, Andy's Bedroom, Sid--I only wish I had appreciated it for what it was upon its release. But I get it now. And I will be there for whatever this company does next. A great start for good old Pixar; The story is quite predictable, but at least it makes up with the heart and execution. The animation, while dated now, was great for its time. The characters are memorable and lovable So overall, nice job Pixar. The Best Animated Movie; This is probably the best animated movie I've ever seen. The story-line and the pace of the movie keeps you pretty engaged. Tom Hanks as Woody is simply the best character introduced in an animated movie. I think should do more voice-overs. And the 2 sequels are also very good. IT'll surely bring back your childhood memories. It's a pure entertainer. Hands Down My Favorite Disney FIlm.; I just recently saw the Toy Story, Toy Story 2 double feature and it was amazing seeing this movie on the big screen after all this time. In my opinion this is the best movie Pixar has made so far, and it will be hard to top it. The animation is flawless and all of the characters are so lovable, you actually forgot that they are toys and not real people. The plot is actually really inventive and the idea of toys being jealous of one another is really fun. I think this movie is perfect for people of any age because the humor can be enjoyed by anyone. Obviously it's the perfect movie for kids, but it's great for adults too. Tim Allen and Tom Hanks lend their voices as the main characters in this film, and they are perfect in it. Overall, this movie is genuine animated classic! \"You've Got A Friend in Me...\"; I literally can't stop singing every time I hear Randy Newman play one of the greatest songs of all time. Anyway, Toy Story is one of the my all-time, no-holds barred, #1 movies of i've ever seen . Toy Story begins when Andy gets a new toy called Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen) and a bitter rivalry between Woody(Tom Hanks)and Buzz ensues. After a trick to get Buzz Lightyear stuck between a drawer goes terribly wrong, Woody knows that he can't show his face back in Andy's room without Buzz Lightyear. After an unhappy reunion at the Gas Station and a misadventure at Pizza Planet, Woody and Buzz are soon kidnapped by a sinister kid named Sid Phillips. Now, Woody and Buzz must reconcile and together, they will either think up a plan to get out of the Sid's house or be doomed under the filthy hands of the crazy kid himself. Also starring Jim Varney(From \"Hey Vern, It's Ernest!\" and all the Ernest movies) as Slinky and Don Rickles(From \"Dennis the Menace Strikes Again\" and \"Beach Blanket Bingo\") as Mr. Potato Head, Toy Story will not only have you rolling on the floor laughing, it will warm your heart. This movie is so passionate, so comical, and so heart-warming, that it spawned off two great sequels beloved for generations to come. I definitely recommend this movie to Toy Story lovers everywhere! Awesome Animated Movie!; Toy Story 3 may not be the best animated movie ever, but this is still one of them, beats the crap out of that crappy Wall-E! Anyway, it follows Woody and the toys, Woody gets jealous of Buzz Lightyear, their owners new favorite toy which of replaced Woody. Woody knocks Buzz out the window, and the other do the same to Woody because of what he did to Buzz. They both fall, then they go over to Andy's moms van, and they hitch a ride. They end up at the gas station, fight, and take the Pizza Planet car. They get there, get stuck in a toy machine with some rubber aliens, and the mean kid, Sid, gets them. And he takes them to his house, where he tortures them. And now we have our movie, did I mention the people don't know the toys are alive? No, well they don't. And this movie as amazing animation, it's perfect. Highly recommend this amazing animated movie. Ground Breaking Animation!; Toy Story is hands down the best animated film of all times. It's also a groundbreaking film with computer animation and it allowed more movie producers to explore the art. Fortunately that did happen because nowadays animated movies are staples in movie making. This is about a toy cowboy named Woody who is the favorite toy of his owner, Andy. He gets jealous when Andy gets a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. It only gets worse when both of them are missing and get stuck in evil Sid's room. The voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are probably the best well-known voices in animated films. The music by Randy Newman is fantastic. The songs and score alike are fantastic and memorable. Overall, this is the best animated film of all times and it spawned two very good sequels. I rate this film 10/10. Perfect! A badge to be worn proudly by Pixar.; Of course my opinion, but truly,honestly perfect! It is an amazing standalone, kid, and Pixar film with all the great motifs of all. It teaches children good values about who are in the world, and mortality. It also appeals to all ages and has incredible animation for 1995, and also was great enough to be unforgotten all the way until now 2015, 20 years later. Buzz's realization that he is just another product to be sold in the world, is in my opinion, one of the greatest moments of movie and entertainment history. The movie gives you a lot of things to speculate on like is Woody a bad toy? Or can a movie have virtually no villain but the hero or at all? The choice is 100% yours and that is what I love most about the movie. It is absolutely timeless and unforgettable and I highly suggest watching it.  This movie was one of the best 3d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an 8.5.(I gave it an 8) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of 3d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! The first full length CGI movie; Toy Story has become at the time of that recording 21 years old. Twenty One!! This the most influential animated movie since Snowwhite and the Seven Dwarfs, which is the every first full length movie and it came out in 1937!! OK to pull myself together ,I am pretty sure that the majority of you, who read this is under 18 and can not think of a time before all animated movies used CGI. And the amazing part is almost everyone though that Toy Story would be flop and their luck of faith, although disturbing, was way off. Also the characters like Woody, Buzz, Rex and the rest of the gang have rooted in pop culture and its sequels are awesome in their own right. In all honesty I cannot choose which of the three is better I love them all equally. To summaries Toy Story is one of the best family flick ever made and you should show it to your kids and maybe re-watch, yourself dear writer, all the trilogy with the Toy Story 4 coming out in 2017!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Wonderful adventure; My opinion: Do not underrate this movie that much. I didn't particularly like it - in fact I almost forgot about it for many years - but the story is simply very, very smart. The idea behind the plot is utter genius. Okay, the actual transformation did not work perfectly, but I insist that it was still a straight accomplishment that had 1. a nice cast, 2. sustainable visual effects and achievements, 3. a great story, 4. both funny and entertaining sequences, that even made you pause and think sometimes, which I regard as a major attainment of any movie. So - I'll give it a solid 7, which it deserves at least. Considering it has Robin Williams in it, it is okay.; I am not really a huge fan of Robin Williams, his type of humor does not usually work for me. In fact, I always thought Mork and Mindy was where he did his best comedy. This movie is about a boy who disappeared while playing a board game. His sister who was playing at the time saw him disappear into said game and is basically a bit crazy later in her life thanks to this incident. Two children find and play this game one day and to their surprise the boy who disappeared has reappeared thanks to a roll of the dice. They now have to continue to play the game as things begin to pelt them, animals run amok, and a determined continually hunts the foursome down. The effects are okay for the time, but they are the type of effects that are in to many movies these days. The type that looks like they are there, but at the same time they do not. The comedy is okay, Robin Williams does not get as worked up in this one as he usually does in his films and you also get to see a young Kristen Dunst. This one coming out after her appearance in Interview with a Vampire. David Alan Grier also stars as a cop who gets caught up in the game as near the end the game really begins to cause quite a lot of chaos. Still, it is an effects driven family film so the story is a bit shallow. So worth a chuckle and it does have a lot to look at, but at times it seems almost like you are watching a video game rather than watching four people play a board game. Not board; Watched this on TV where it was aired as a tribute to the late Robin Williams. It's an enjoyable family-entertainment fantasy adventure with Williams playing a grown man who as a boy was sucked into a mysterious, dark board game called Jumanji, freed years later by a couple of young children who happen upon the game when they move into Williams's character by this time run-down house. Along with Williams also fully-grown girl friend of the time Kirsten Dunst, the four of them brave everything the game throws at them to finish it and free Williams to return to his old life. And does the game throw everything at them! Crazy monkeys, a roaring lion, a jungle which comes to life, hordes of stampeding elephants zebras and rhinos and one very persistent big game hunter. A veritable special effects fest, while the plot amounts to no more than awaiting the outcome of the next roll of the dice on the board, it all makes for good clean exciting fun and who amongst us as never enjoyed playing a board game as a child. The back stories about Williams being bullied as a child, having a fractious relationship with his dad and his adult wooing of Dunst are lightly drawn but all of course resolved happily ever after by the end. Williams is fine after he makes his delayed first appearance, portraying yet again a child trapped in a man's body just as he did in a line going back through Peter Pan in \"Hook\", \"Popeye\" all the way to his breakout part in \"Mork and Mindy\". Dunst offers good support and the kids aren't too gauche and sentimental either. Nice to see \"Cheers\" Bebe Neuwirth get a decent part too. I wouldn't call it Robin Williams defining role but as an update on the old children's matinée features, this was an entertaining feature made the better by Williams engaging performance. R.I.P. to him. Underrated, I think; This film is a lot better than others have ranked it. It deserves more than a 6 average. I gave it a 7 and believe it's underrated. The basic story is that years ago, while a child, Robin Williams was transported into the game he was playing at the time and trapped there. Later, two other children find the game board and play it, releasing a now grown up Williams, along with all sorts of dangerous animals and vines and stuff. These things threaten mankind and it's up to Williams, along with Bonnie Hunt, to find a way to stop these things from killing off man. There's a good bit of suspense and with every move the heroic folks make, something counteracts it and things nearly always end up being worse than before. They finally determine that the only way to end the horror is to finish the game that Williams started all those years ago. Now, if they could only find the game board. This is a well written adaptation of a popular book, and I found it quite entertaining. a game not like the other ones; \"Jumanji\" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game \"jumanji\" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy. Watchable Effects-laden family entertainer, though a bit predictable; This is a watchable family entertainer with some genuine scares. The plot appears complicated but is actually fairly simple. Hordes of wild animals appear and people flee. This happens again and again like clockwork throughout the film making it predictable after a while. On the plus side, Robin Williams is in manic form, and the Special Effects are agreeable though dated. Kirsten Dunst is very appealing in one of her earlier films. This is generally a pleasant watch, but on the whole, I prefer the newer film Zathura, which is also based on a board game. Overall 6/10 18 years of being a \"favourite\"; I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and \"Jumanji\" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie &amp; it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life. Has more depth than the book, but lacks much of its lustre; When I was in fifth Grade, I read a book called Jumanji. It was a 1982 book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera. A year later (February or March 1996), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In 1869, two young chaps bury in a chest \"Jumanji\", a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy. 100 years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in 1969, but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight\"; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic 1995, where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost... Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm. The other three characters, but the movie is so focused on the four players that everyone else looks like a decoration set. The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining . But the screenplay touches on the drama scenes so lightly that they do not create much justice to the film. The anarchic present looks like a throwback of Back to the Future II's Alternate 1985. But all ends well at the conclusion, and people will find it likable, including those who read the book. By the way, this was the first time I heard about Kirsten Dunst... **1/2 out of **** HORRIBLE!; This was on TV again recently, and naturally the kids stopped to watch it. Why I will never know. We own a copy and they rarely if ever put it in the VCR. Whose idea was this movie? Joe Johnston, the guy responsible for some of the worst movies of the 1990s and whose only really decent film was HONEY, which was way back when? I have said previously this is really a horror movie in disguise and obviously not a particularly good one. What in hell is with the special effects? Is there a worse-looking set of animals in film history? I wonder all these years later if maybe the distorted, cartoonish look of the monkeys and lion were intentional, since they sprang from a children's board game. But then why do the elephants, rhinos, pelican and even the oversized mosquito, look relatively normal? Robin Williams is about as bad as he ever got, except for the nightmarishly bad JACK (although I never saw his ripoff of Benigni, which I can just imagine to what depths he plummets, and I forgive him WHAT DREAMS MAY COME since he obviously did not write or direct that fiasco). View JUMANJI at your own mental peril! One of my favourite films ever; This film is great, it is definitely a family film (little kids might get scared when there are *SPOILER* guns shooting or when the giant spiders have surrounded the actors,or when a crocodile attacks the man but apart from that it isn't too scary), but it is one of those films everyone has got to see. I first watched this film when it first came onto TV (they now repeat it every year), and I have been captivated by the imaginative story every single time I've seen it. The basic storyline is that two kids find an old board game, but when they start playing, the madness begins- stampeding animals and more! This is a story about friendship, love, sticking together and much, much more. If you haven't seen this film already WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!! Action and adventure for the kids, and Robin Williams for the adults; Find a comfortable chair, lay out the board, grab the dice, and get ready to play.  But remember:  once you start this game, you can't stop.  If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must. \"Jumanji\" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  The basic premise stays the same:  a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure.  When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things.  Only finishing the game will make it all go away. In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added.  Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself.  He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing.  The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams!  Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter. Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles.  He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt.  The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the \"This is MY baby\" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike. Not for 13+ age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for 1980 not for 1995. Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. I love this movie so much; If you do not love this movie you are crazy. Its filled with action and excitement. I love Sarah Whittle played by the famous Bonnie Hunt. I also like Carl Bentley, a clueless police officer played by the comedian David Alan Grier. This movie is so creative. My sister and I watch the movie every weekend, we do not get tired of it. This movie did not get the awesome rating it deserved. People sometimes do not understand a quality move when they see one. I would strongly, strongly, strongly recommend the movie. Trust me you will love it to death. If you do not... then you are odd. Please watch the movie, try it you'll love it...duh!!! A great movie; JUMANJI I loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today! The movie is about a boy who finds a board game called Jumanji. When he takes it home and starts to play it with a friend, he soon realises that this is no ordinary game. He gets sucked into the game and is not released again until 26 years later 2 more kids find the game and release him. Now he is grown up and has to find a way to end this game before everything it releases destroys the town. Due to the sad passing of the genius that was Robin Williams, the TV channels have decided to show all of his movies. Jumanji was the first one I saw. The story to this film is like not her that I had seen before. It was an original idea (unless there is another film I don't know about) that was just so imaginative. It works really well and has a great adventure element about it. The effects are average. This was made in the mid 90s so that probably has something to do with it. The animals were obviously not real. You could see the lion was so mechanical it made me laugh. And the other animals were so obviously computer generated. But it was comical and that just added to the fun of the film. The acting was great. The main character was played by Robin Williams. He was as energetic and full of character in this role, just like he brought to every role he took. Other cast members were Jonathan Hyde, a young Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bonnie Hunt. Bonnie Hunt was brilliant. Her reaction and facial expressions made me laugh a few times in this. Another stand out performance was by David Alan Grier. David was so funny as the cop. His comedy timing was excellent and deserves a mention. This film really does keep you entertained throughout and is just a lot of fun to watch... Even now nearly 20 years later. I will give this 7 out of 10. Normally I end my reviews with a quote from the movie, but this time I just want to say how gutted I am about the news of Robins death. I am a fan of his work. I watched Mork and Mindy when I was a kid and grew up watching Jumanji, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam, Jack etc... There were so many great films that he made. I always saw Robin as so full of energy and full of life. He had one of the greatest smiles in Hollywood and when i saw an interview with him, he seemed so chirpy and happy. It just shows that in front of the camera, you never know what is going on in people's heads. I was sad to hear he had been suffering from depression. Depression is such a deadly illness. I know this sounds stupid, but I am gutted that I was not there to talk to him, help him. I hate to think that he felt so alone, especially as he had millions of fans all over the world that knew him on screen. He made the world laugh out loud so many times. Even through bad times in my life, watching his movies has put a smile on my face. Robin deserved much more happiness than he got. He gave so much to me and the rest of the world and it doesn't seem right that he should end his life this way. I will miss seeing new movies from him, but will always continue to go back to enjoy his old ones. Robin will live on in my house and he will always continue to make me smile. R.I.P. Robin Williams. Jumanji  a timeless adventure story; There are few children's movies that I particularly enjoyed  I can recount The Borrowers, Labyrinth and The Neverending Story. Jumanji, however takes a new place among children's films  in fact, it may seem that initially, Jumanji is about simplistic story about kids playing a board game. Based on a gorgeous picture book story of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg, this movie takes a beautiful magical adventure and makes it into a thrill ride that defies all natural laws. Time travel, physical transformations, perceptual distortions and multiple universes are just a few of the things that Jumanji toys with. The most evident phenomena is that the characters run in two different and parallel universes, one where Jumanji exists, and the other where it is just a dream. The life of Judy and Peter as orphans exists in a different world from the one where Jumanji doesn't exist  in other words, Jumanji is a catalyst of fate, an evil entity that does not bring about awe as it did in Allsberg's book, but fear. The world that Allen Parrish is doomed to be incarcerated in the jungles of Jumanji is another one, but that period of time is nonexistent in the world he will eventually live in. This is the beauty of the movie; that these characters can only allow their trauma and epiphanies to cross worlds. With each roll of the dice, the characters grow and change. The ending with 'Jumanji' is mark of the end of that universe  everything that the jungle world had yielded, from the colonist-hunter Van Pelt to the roaring stampede and the monkeys had to return, to be sealed into the game and the universe. The game controls life; but it is merciful when played to the end without cheating. The mental agony and pain must have been tremendous for the Parrishes. Presumably, Alan spent his twenty six years in the jungle, but returned to his old self only to again relive his life as if it never happened. The temporal distortion must have presumably had an effect on his parents, although only Sarah seems to notice. (She was playing the game  and only those playing are directly affected, but in the game universe of Judy and Peter we see a problem in the movie's understanding of temporal change) The power of fate in deciding the endgame was critical in the film. It seems that the game was in itself a game of a game; it was all planned out and ready to go. In fact, it also seems that no matter how crazy or perilous the situation is, the characters cannot be killed. Even Van Pelt says at the Sir Sav A Lot that \"I am hunting only Alan. I won't kill you, since you didn't roll\" He too is bound to the rules of the game, no matter how much of a colonialist he is. The game instills a high level of fear without death, in order for the game to continue, all the characters must be present. So in one way, no one need be scared of anything in the game. Instead, the game builds resilience in the characters. It was natural that in the end the end was initiated by the future; or more appropriately the past. At the end, both Sarah and Alan make up for the trouble they have caused and have a life bond from the experience. The jumping between 1994 and 1964 is a critical aspect where we see that the horrors of the game have allowed Judy and Peter's parents to not die in the ski accident. They are oddly willing to put an end to their vacation when they hardly know the Parrishes \"In the jungle, you must wait, until you roll a five or eight\"  Jumanji \"Roll a two, roll a four, but never ask for more\"  Gautam RATING: 10/10 (amazing) Great fun; Robin Williams is in his element as an adult/child and with wonderful support from Kirsten Dunst, Ian Richardson playing the Englishman hunter and sending himself up nicely, the excellent children and others make this escapist adventure at it's best. A Dazzling Film!; I liked Jumanji. It is way better than I thought it would be. The story starts out with the burying of a game in 1869. It is then uncovered by a boy named Alan, 100 years later. As he is playing it, he gets sucked into the game until someone rolls a 5 or an 8. That happened 26 years later. Now along with two kids and a woman who was playing the game with Alan in 1969, Alan has to finish the game despite all the creatures appearing out of the game. The special effects are amazing. They were effective and used well. The acting is decent. Robin Williams did a good job as he usually does. I did think that Hunter Van Pelt could've been more realistic. The music is pretty good. I always liked James Horner's music. There are only minor flaws here or there. I rate this movie 9/10. Better than the sequel!; I really enjoyed this movie. I saw the sequel first, and then the \"original\" and I must say I am impressed and surprised by the way the movie worked. And I enjoyed it a lot. It's a board game that, when you roll dice, the numbers state where your piece should go, and then a message appears. The message could be something like, \"run away before the lion gets you\" and sure enough, a lion will suddenly appear in your house, ready to get you! I rate this 8/10 because of the fact that there was mild swearing, and I thought it was pushing it with the kiss at the end. But overall I enjoyed the movie! Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Welcome to the jungle, we've got fun and games; Oh yes, another childhood favourite starring the late-great Robin Williams, a true master of his craft. Jumanji simply put is a bundle of fun, why analyse a film like this? Truth is you shouldn't, just sit back and let the wacky action take you away..., it has wild animals, a dangerous board game and a throwback from the 19th century, intent on murdering Alan (poor Robin Williams!) So as a child Alan discovers a board game called Jumanji, but this is no ordinary game, he enlists his good friend Sarah to play it with him, unfortunately for the poor lad, he rolls the wrong number and gets sucked into the game, for many years. Years later, two kids Judy and Peter rediscover the game that had been hidden and decide to play, quickly releasing Alan from his jungle prison, from here on in the action is frantic and joyous, with a race around town, an adult Sarah joining the game and many-many mishaps as the quartet anxiously try to complete the game and get to the end. Who on earth thought a film about a board game could be so good? Masterful, cute and camp comedy by the legend of the genre helps to lift the film up to lofty heights, a very young Kirsten Dunst and an always reliable Bonnie Hunt put in professional performances as well..., a proper Sunday afternoon film that's a surefire way to boost moral. For 1995 when Jumanji was released, the special effects and computer generated imagery were spectacular, to make the variety of animals appear so lifelike was amazing..., the carnage that spreads across town was well shot and the cinematographer and art department team had a real good eye for detail. There's a new Jumanji film soon to be released, kind of a sequel to this film starring The Rock, but the new film will have to go some way to living up to the original, I doubt it will be anywhere near the quality and enjoyment that this film possesses, The Rock instead of Robin Williams, and that's going to work how? Sit down, relax and enjoy, with Jumanji it's as simple as that. Brilliant family entertainment!; While I try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, I do think the rating for this film is too low. The film is absolutely fantastic in all departments. I will admit, there are some bits that are quite scary due to some scenes that are amazingly dark. The film does start off slowly, but when the film fast forwards to twenty six years later, the film turns into fast-paced family entertainment. Other than one or two scary scenes and the slow beginning, I could find very little wrong with Jumanji. The story is great, very intriguing and filled with humour, scares and poignancy. The cinematography and scenery are constantly breathtaking, and the special effects are extraordinary. The film is aided by a hilarious and poignant script, spirited direction, atmspheric music and the fact that it goes at a very fast pace. Even the acting was great, with Robin Williams in one of his best performances as Alan Parrish. While he is subtle in places, the director allows him to be funny, which is what he does best. Bonnie Hunt is good too and she and Williams have great chemistry, and Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst are cute and lively. Plus the ending is nice and satisfying. All in all, I love this movie, even with its very minor problems, it is non-stop fast paced family entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Exciting Family Adventure; In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called \"Jumanji\", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished. Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human. The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like \"Dead Poet's Society\" or \"Good Morning, Vietnam\"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality. This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor. Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the \"Narnia\" stories). Fortunately, any moralising in \"Jumanji\" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of \"alternative timelines\". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10 Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is 1969, and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats. 26 years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good! wild CGI destruction gets repetitive; In 1869, two boys bury a mysterious dangerous wooden chest. In 1969 Brantford, New Hampshire, young Alan Parrish gets picked on by bullies. He finds the box in a local construction site. He opens the chest to find a board game Jumanji. His father is sending him to boarding school. He is about to run away when his best friend Sarah Whittle comes by. They play the game and Alan is pulled into the board game. Twenty six years later, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) buys the rundown mansion planning to open a bed-and-breakfast. She brings her niece Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter (Bradley Pierce) who lost their parents in a car accident. The kids find the board game in the attic and start playing it. Alan (Robin Williams) is released. They track down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) to finish the game and bring all the released apparitions to an end. Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) was a friend who worked at Alan's shoe factory and is now a cop. The game brings out big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) who looks like Alan's father Sam. The basic idea of a board game that comes alive is one with great possibilities. I wish that it is more than just a series of crazy CGI destruction. I wish that the players needed to use their brain power to solve clues. The constant escaping from one thing to the next gets a little bit repetitive. They start piling on top of one another. Williams is not quite as lovable as expected. Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier are kind of fun. There is an uncontrolled quality to this children's movie. i miss my childhood; 6.6,,,,,,,,,,,,, i don't believe this. 10 people 10,,, anyone who have watched this as a kid will give this a 10... common for heavens sake,,, this is the best fantasy movie that some one could wish for as a kid.......... for heavens sake this movie was not made keeping logic in mind please,, its just fun,,, thats all it is,,,this movie is one of the best memories A KID OF 90S HAVE AS A KID,,,people who hate this movie can go to hell,,,, any parents out there please let your kids watch this,,, they will love you a lot..these are the kind of movies which make me miss my childhood ,,, Jumanji Lays Down The Smack!; This is a great Hollywood thrill ride of a movie.  I loved the idea for this flick, a mystical board game coming to life.  What's great about this film is that for once Robin Williams isn't doing his usual \"Robin Williams\" stand-up schtick.  He's playing an original character and it's about time too, daddy-o. This movie is a great blend of thrills, special effects and laughs.  I like how it uses a lot of the old jungle movie icons like the Great White British Hunter, giant crocs, lions, mischievous monkeys and rhinos.  And even the actual Jumanji game board itself looked cool!  I wanted to own one.  I write screenplays myself on occasion and this film made me wanna write my own special effects extravaganza! But go checkety check out Jumanji and have a great time at the movies. Dig?  Dangerous Boarding Game; In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called \"Jumanji\" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan's father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. \"Jumanji\" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90's. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Jumanji\" Watts meets New England; Disaster visits a New England town: When all hell breaks loose, when beasts from nowhere trample the streets and earthquakes rip the blocks and giant mosquitoes and God-knows-what-next befall the descendants of pilgrims and fishermen, of Minutemen and revolutionaries and of immigrants yearning to breath free, those same hard-scrabble, salt-of-the-earth, no-nonsense patriots all join hands, pull together, and-- . . . loot their neighbors' downtown storefronts! Unbelievable.  Tinseltown belts out a fairly well-done and imaginative fantasy (which truly `Jumanji' is), and then--wouldn't you know it?--foul it with one of the many flies stuck in the ointment that is Hollywood, a scene so diagnostic of the intellectual sickness that has infested the industry since Hellman sang her praises to Stalin.  Then again, maybe it is believable. `Jumanji's' only other flaws: a part too small for the underrated Bebe Neuwirth (a joy to watch always and here no less so), kids full of bravery that's a little too scripted and moments of suspense that really aren't. If we can ignore all that, even the brief bit of class-warfare propaganda, then \"Jumanji' becomes eminently watchable, even memorable. But promise us you won't loot any stores next time you see monkeys charging down the street. If I could go back...; I love this movie. I don't know why. Maybe because I wonder what it would be like to start my life over again when I was 10 or 12, knowing what I know now at...well, much older. My favorite part is at the end, when Alan and Sarah come face to face in 1995 with the 2 kids who played the game with them the PREVIOUS 1995. Visually very interesting and not a rip off of any other film, that's for sure! When your life hangs on a simple roll of dice...; NOTE: this comment is provided by Christopher Dorian and Peter Rhydon. When young Alan Parish and his friend Sarah Wittle sat in Alan's living room and began playing to that strange game named \"Jumanji\", neither them, nor the audience, could have expected what was coming after. Because \"Jumanji\" is not your parents' \"Payday\". The game instructions are simple: roll the dice and the player who reaches the end first is the winner. It's just in-between that things go a little bit different... What was just a little game meeting transforms into a special effects extravaganza, filled with all sorts of creatures and eye-catching action scenes and stunts that seem to be borrowed from the best moments of the Indiana Jones adventures. The computerized special FX are the main aspects of the movie and they mostly succeed to their task. While they may look archaic today, remember that these visual tricks were created in 1995, and that computer-driven movies were a new sensation. Looking at the lion's faces isn't completely interesting, but it's worth the effort. Action scenes are well conceived, well acted, and well pictured. Particularly memorable is the crocodile fight in the flooded house, with the characters trying to defend themselves like the Orca crew in \"Jaws\". Those two points are tightly linked with one man: director Joe Johnston, who previously made \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\" and \"The Pagemaster\". He clearly shows that his former employers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had a huge effect on him and that he gets inspiration from those two phenomenons. And when we see the final result, we could feel that Johnston could become a phenomenon too. But it isn't the case. And why? Because \"Jumanji\" relies on a quicksand storyline and poor lines, because characters are occasionally believable and because action scenes are not epic in the Star Wars or Indiana Jones style. The concept is excellent, but the developed elements are not on the same level. Characters are often performing in cliché and predictable scenes, instead of innovative situations. If we talk about the actors, one should prevail from the others: Robin Williams. Even if his grinning smile looks stuck on his face like The Joker, he is a convincing jungle raider and his performance is fantastic, whatever it is for dramatic, terrifying or comic moments. What is also good about the film is that it can be enjoyed by people from all ages. Children will be delighted and excited by the animals depicted here and adults will enjoy the magnitude of the special effects employed during the film. The dialog is generally well suited for a general audience and there is no real troubling or disturbing moment. It's good to see that the '90s still deals with that kind of stuff. Technological developments imply more and more sophisticated video games of all kinds, but it's heart-warming to see that classic board games can provide excitement like this. After seeing that movie, playing \"Monopoly\" would seem to be like a tea party or some other kind of silly joke. Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... Epitome of Moronic Hollywood Film-Making; A previous reviewer wrote: \"A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie.\" I agree in part and disagree in part with that comment. The problem is impossible to pinpoint, because there are PLENTY of \"big problems\" with this movie! \"Random hazard generator\" is the PERFECT description of the ancient board game! Random hazard after random hazard until the game ends is what is supposed to pass for \"plot\" in this movie. Did anybody count how many times the game board fell out of and back into the players' hands? That, too is supposed to pass for tension. Ultimately, the film fails because there isn't any development of the back story. What was the origin of the game? Now, that would have been an interesting question to explore! And how does the game work? All we ever see is the game's projection of \"random hazards\" OUTWARD into the reality of the players, but somehow Alan (Robin Williams) apparently was sucked INTO the game. How did that happen, and why doesn't it happen to any of the current players of the game? Actually, the guy in the pith helmet is, more or less, the human villain in this movie, but he is never more than an inexplicable, evil cartoon. Was he, too sucked into the game like Alan, or is he the sole human \"random hazard\" generated by the game? Why is he so determined, not to hunt animals, but to MURDER Alan? The film just glosses over the fact that this sub-plot is actually one of premeditated murder! The hunter guns for Alan simply because the plot demands it. But the movie makes no attempt whatever to explain the character. Never once did I sense any genuine emotional chemistry among the characters. Just a bunch of actors acting - not INTERACTING. The love story sub-plot felt obligatory, never genuine. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt never generated enough chemistry to make me care whether Alan and Sarah got together in the predictable end. All in all, this film has the germ of an interesting idea that is really wasted by focusing on mindless, non-stop \"random hazards,\" poor CGI effects, \"lots of screaming and running around\" and insufficient character development. Except for the precise nature of each \"random hazard,\" the whole film was disappointingly predictable, including the cliché of the almost-kiss in the midst of peril routine. How many zillion times has that been used? The dialog is a similarly endless stream of clichés. The issue was never HOW the game would end - but WHEN. The more interesting issues were never even glanced at. This kind of movie can only appeal to people raised on video games. It was generated by that kind of adventure-for-the-sake-of-adventure mentality, and it has that same kind of feel. This Ain't No Game!; CONTAINS SPOILERS In 1869, two boys bury something unknown but whatever it is, it's very dangerous. It stays for 100 years. In 1969, young Alan Parrish rides his bike one lovely day, unfortunately he's soon chased by Billy Jessup and his gang. Alan goes to his father, Samuel's shoe factory. Alan tells his father what's up, but his father merely tells him that he must stand and face something you're afraid of, so Alan did and got the crap kicked out of him. Suddenly, he heard drums beating. It was in a construction site. He dug up a wooden board game called Jumanji. At home, Alan's parents have announced that they shall send him to Cliffside School for Boys. Alan refuses to go. Samuel get's mad and storms out of the house with his wife. Alan's friend, Sarah Widdle, comes over that night and the two decide to play the game Alan found. It resulted in Alan being sucked into the game until someone would roll a 5 or 8. 26 years later-1995. A woman named Nora, her niece Judy and nephew Peter buy the old Parrish house. One aternoon, while Aunt Nora left for the office and the kids were about to leave for school when they hear drums beating. The game was calling. They dig it out of the attic and decide to play it. Out of the game comes monkeys, mosquitos and a lion! Also, Alan comes out. He's very grateful, then goes to the old shoe factory to find his parents. He learns of their passing; by finishing the game, they can put an end to the wild animal attacks, so the three go off to find Sarah Widdle, because according to the game, it was her turn. At first she was reluctant to play, but she did. They encounter a huge pod plant and a hunter, Van Pelt who wants to kill Alan for some reason. Well, after braving a stampede, a huge rain fall, giant spiders and an earthquake, the game was over and all went back to 1969 where Alan patched things up with his father, he and Sarah get rid of the game and live happily ever after in the bright and cheerful 1995, rather than the dark one Jumanji had created. Pretty good movie! Nice special effects. Robin Williams was good, as always. Bonnie Hunt was good. The kids were too. Kirsten Dunst grew up to play Spiderman's love interest. Also, the same actor that plaus Samuel Parrish (Jonathan Hyde of Richie Rich) also plays Van Pelt. I hear there's going to be a sequel: Jumanji 2. But it doesn't have Robin Williams. For the life of me, I can't figure out what it will be like. But for now, you gotta see the first one! -- Jumanji! From Book to Film; As a child in 1995, this was one of the greatest adventure films for a kid in my generation. The book from where it came, was good, but the filmmakers made the adaptation pretty darn amazing. The fact that Robin Williams starred made the film better, as Robin was a huge draw to family films of that era. Who ever knew that Jumanji would have a cult following or that it would spawn an actual board game (nothing comes to life), and eventually a sequel in 2017. Too bad Robin isn't here to enjoy or be a part of the sequel. Bonnie Hunt also starred alongside Robin in this film as Sarah, but she's not quite as memorable. Sorry! David Alan Grier also co-starred as Carl the police officer, his acting was somewhat more memorable. One of the most memorable acting performances of the film was Jonathan Hyde as Sam Parrish (Alan's dad) and his dual role as Van Pelt (the hunter from Jumanji). In the end, it was a great film, probably felt more now by some since the passing of Robin Williams. But those of us who've loved the film since the beginning know he made the film what it was. Ignore the critics on this one--it's a great romp that gets better with time!; **Warning--Spoilers** We've owned Jumanji on video since it was released in 1996 and pull it out a couple of times each year for kicks.  It's as fun today as the first time we saw it with plenty of twists and plot turns to keep you hooked through the closing credits.  I've read the reviews by several of the critics on IMDB, and it is obvious they just don't get it. Criticism #1:  \"Jumanji is too scary for kids\":  Our children (ages 2 to 11) have all seen this at an early age and none was ever the slightest bit frightened.  Jumanji doesn't scare kids because 1) the dangers are never prolonged; 2) there is a ton of humor interwoven in the dialogue; and 3) everyone knows it's just a game.  After all, the pranks in Jumanji are no more harmful than what you see in Looney Tunes or Roadrunner &amp; Coyote and kids instinctively get that. Criticism #2: \"Jumanji has no story\": wrong again.  Every time we watch it, something new comes out, particularly in the relationships between the main characters.  There are particularly poignant moments between the father and son characters allowing them to reconcile and overcome the aloofness that can keep men from coming to grips with their feelings toward each other. And, the Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt relationship has a great payoff with romance and their triumph over forces of nature (real and implied). There are also numerous humorous details and themes that run through the film from stampeding rhinos to run-a-muck monkeys that keeping you laughing throughout the entire film. Criticism #3: \"The special effects overwhelm the story\":  The film is based on an animated children's book and the special effects intentionally mirror the artwork from the book.  My kids oohed and ahhed at each and every FX enhanced adventure from the stampeding animals to the wood floor turning to quicksand and in each case the result was to stimulate a great deal of discussion about the ideas in the story.  The monkeys are particularly funny evoking squeals of laughter as they embark on their high jinx. So, don't let bad reviews deter you from seeing this flick.  You and your family will have a great time during the movie and your kids will want to talk about every aspect of Jumanji after it's over, even if it's just an excuse not to go to bed on time! The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for 25(?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\"  So you'll help us?; Robin Williams is incredible as Alan in this outstanding adventure movie. The supporting cast is phenomenal. The costumes are conservative. One of the good films in the genre, Jumanji will dare the viewer to play the game. 7 out of 10. When two kids from the 60's stumble upon a game, one of them is sucked into its jungle.  Now it's up to two present day kids to finish it.; ********/10 This movie deserves more than it received because it is not only a very different plot but has excellent character development, which is key to a great movie. The special effects are so-so (due to the time period in which it was made), but it is overall exciting while humorous. There isn't a movie quite like this one, and is one of my favorites. Robbin Williams is tremendous and while watching it you forget his true identity. Kerstien Dunst is young, but is impressive for her age, commonly not found in some movies. I guess if I'd have to sum this movie up in one word it'd be \"unique\". Not many films have monsoons indoors or mansions turned into jungles. Entertaining...but one major problem; Jumanji is an entertaining movie. I'm surprised its IMDB \"User Rating\" is only 5.9. I would give it a 7. However, I don't understand why the kids (and Robin Williams) keep playing the game. With every roll of the dice, they put their lives in more jeopardy...along with the lives of everyone in the city. They could have stopped anytime after the bats or the mosquitoes or the monkeys or the lion. But they kept going (under the guise of \"finishing the game is the only way to make everything return to normal\"). I kept yelling at the screen, \"Stop playing Jumanji and you'll be okay.\" Of course, if they had stopped playing the game, then there's no movie. not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late 1960s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ A little adventurous... and childish.; Jumanji is a great idea.  The movie has great potential and could have turned out excellent and a true action classic. However, some aspects of the movie prevent that.  For example, the monkeys in the kitchen and abroad hardly look like monkeys.  They look like warped, evil, demonic beings with fur and tails that were only made to cause mischief.  Well, sure, you might say that's what the game meant to do, but come on... I think they should have used real monkeys here. Certain parts of the dialogue are a little corny and make one feel as though we're watching \"Spy Kids\", which can sometimes really ruin the feel that they're in a life-or-death situation. The acting was great (some parts it was not), and as usual, Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst put on an above-average performance. The action and crashes and other sequences are a contradiction, in a way.  Here we have fake-looking monkeys, but superbly crafted action. The music, composed by James Horner, is quite dull and does not help get you into the spirit of the movie.  A lower-than-average job on his part. Overall, this movie is really good.  I would suggest watching it if you can get past some annoying areas of the movie. Almost 20 years on and it's still entertaining kids of all ages; Jumanji was on TV today, and my 8 year old son had liked him in \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and I remembered it being fun, so with sweets and crisps we sat down to watch it. Orphans Judy (A young Kristen Dunst, who had started in \"An Interview With A Vampire\" the previous year, but still a few years away from Spiderman fame) and Peter move in to a mansion with their Aunt (Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers) where the find a board game called Jumanji. When they start playing, they free Alan Parish (Robin Williams) who was trapped in the game when he was a child. Robin Williams is always fun to watch and he was very popular at the time, due to movies like \"Aladdin\" and \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and Kristen Dunst was a real talent as a young actress, none of the annoying traits of usual child actors. Of the supporting cast David Alan Grier is fun as a hapless Police Officer, as is Jonathan Hyde in duel roles as a hunter and young Alan's Dad. Defo worth checking out if you have kids, and more than enjoyable even if you don't. Some of the special effects have dated badly, but are still OK, most of the humour is spot on too. My son got a big kick out if it and really enjoyed it. And I thought for a 19 year old special effects laden kids movie it had held up pretty well. An enjoyable board game, so an enjoyable movie!; This is one of the movies that I really enjoy, even if I do not like comedy and fantasy that much, by the way I don't like Robin Williams either, he thinks he's a funny person, but he isn't, some of his movies like `Jack', `Good Will Hunting', and some others are quite bad. Most of his movies leave too much to be desired. He's just annoying, because it seems to me that he thinks that everybody who sees him will laugh at the ridiculous things he does, he enjoys making fun of the human body, women, men, etc. I dislike it enormously; however I must say that I really enjoyed this movie even though he was starring and the visual effects were obviously computerized. I was impressed by the originality of Jumanji. It's such an innovative, interesting and enjoyable movie. I liked it because the plot is extremely original, creative and gripping. Who on earth would be able to think of a game like Jumanji? An imaginative game in which journeys, action, fantasy, and perhaps a little bit of terror surpass all things. I like this movie because it teaches us to enjoy everyday to its fullest, we see that Alan Parker was a frustrated kid at the beginning of the movie, but after staying in the jungle until the dice read 5 or 8, he realized how worthy his life was. Also it teaches us to respect others, for instance we see the little boy who began to turn into a wolf after cheating on the game was crying and Alan who was a grown-up person then yelled at him, and made him feel bad, but after that he was sorry since he remembered the way his father yelled at him, so this is a valuable lesson, since it shows that parents must be patient and loving to their family, but sometimes love can be hazardous to them. `Jumanji' is a nice movie for all ages; it's a very risky, but enjoyable game, in which your life is at stake. The board game (Jumanji) was good looking, it was really mysterious and interesting, whoever saw it would love to play it. Overall the movie was a very good one, I enjoyed every minute and especially Kristin Dunst's performance who also played in \"Spiderman\", I also enjoyed Mr. Williams's performance, I'm glad he at last did something worth it. Anyway it was an enjoyable movie, but I'd have loved this if it had been more dramatic, terrifying, sad, etc. 8/10 Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. Game You Could Only Dream About; Alan Parrish is the son of wealthy shoe maker Samuel Parrish. But the life of a rich man's son changes when young Alan comes upon a new board game, he is transported into it while playing it. Twenty or so years later two orphaned children, Judy (Kristen Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) come upon the game and play it. Next thing they now, Alan pops out of the game twenty years older along with a lion and some monkeys. It is a race to win the game with Alan (Robin Williams), Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt), Judy, and Peter while trying to outrun stampedes and Van Pelt, the man hunter. The movie has what a movie should have. The interaction of some of then animals is sometimes scary, sometimes funny, and sometimes just strange. Robin Williams is good like always and supported by Dunst, Hunt, and Jonathan Hyde (Van Pelt). It's what some mite call a child thriller. What to classify it as is though but it was good. Jumanji. Starring: Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kristen Dunst, Bradley Pierce, and Jonathan Hyde. 3 out of 5 Stars. Probably not perfect, but very fun; Jumanji is a highly imaginative and very fun movie. The visuals are good, and the story is creative and exciting. The storyline consists of a man being sucked into a board game. 26 years later, two kids find the board game and set him free. However, the game board has already released a few dangers, and those dangers must be stopped. The only way to do that is to finish the board game, and the animals (or whatever else was released from the game) will be put back into the game. There is action and minor thrills, and the movie emerges as being a fun experience. It's kind of creative, and it's an excellent adventure film. Sure, it is a bit cliché'd and the monkeys look pretty corny, but don't let them distract you from the overall enjoyment of the movie. 6.5/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment. A breathless unforgettable adventure!; I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind... This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure. Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story. Great! 10 out of 10 from me! My favorite movie as a child; I first saw this movie when I was 8 or something and I loved it immediately. The idea that you could actually play a game that could have the consequences Jumanji had was awe-inspiring for a kid like me. When I saw it again on TV 2 or 3 years later I taped it and watched it over and over again. At one moment I would lay in my bed and play the movie second by second and word by word in my head. That's how obsessed I was with this film. The action made me want to study biology and major in zoology actually. But I didn't study biology, I am a film student now. And from a film student point of view this movie is, of course, nothing special. The effects aren't perfect, it's no quality film and certainly not Oscar worthy or anything. But from a personal point of view, it still amazes me. When I watch it again it takes me back to my childhood and the amazing visions I had back then of it actually happening in my school and such. For that sense of nostalgia and the memories I have for this movie, I give this a straight 10 out of 10. After all, it was my favorite movie as a child. Brings back a lot of memories. Still a good ride.; My Take: A terrific special effects-laden adventure. JUMANJI is among those films I strongly remember from my childhood. Along with JURASSIC PARK and its sequel, JUMANJI is among those films I enjoy watching multiple times just to see creatures wreck havoc on a crowded street, monsters crawl in from the dark and other bits of special effects extravaganza. I strongly remember the elephants and rhinos stampeding around the crowded streets, a giant man-eating flower with vine-like tentacles, those messy (and weakly done CGI) monkeys with antics borrowed from GREMLINS, the crocodile and the shot of the house breaking apart. What I didn't remember was how faulty the dramatic interludes were. Which is exactly the point. JUMANJI is a wildly entertaining special effects extravaganza that works much better that way. Director Joe Johnston, who revived old-fashioned pulp adventures with THE ROCKETEER and later made JURASSIC PARK III so much better than it might have been, is such an accomplished action director. JUMANJI is a terrific and highly entertaining, if sometimes perilous, family adventure, though it does make several rest stops for back-stories and a bit of drama which sacrifices the pacing. The movie opens with two kids in 1969 with two kids curiously playing the titular game board which eventually unleashes African bats in the fireplace and sucking in little Alan Parrish (then played by Adam Hann-Byrd) inside the game. Forward 26 years later, someone else has bought the old Parrish mansion and the two new kids (Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce) dig up the old board game in the dusty old attic and give the dice a little role, and all hell breaks loose in town. With a little help from an older Alan Parrish (now played by Robin Williams) and his now older best friend Sarah (delightfully played by Bonnie Hunt), they try to finish what they started, unleashing more special effects behemoth after another. That's just about the \"plot\" of JUMANJI, yet I can go on forever with its visual treats. While the CGI doesn't live up to today standards (not to mention the totally unconvincing CGI monkeys!), but some of them in particular (including the terrific sequences where elephants and rhinos rampage around town and inside the mansion living room) still are eye candy. And, courtesy of director Johnston, there are still well-orchestrated moments of excitement. Stars Hunt and co-star David Alan Grier as a cop having a bad day provide the laughs. Despite some dull moments, which have a very major thing to do with its weak writing department, JUMANJI is still an amiable piece of entertainment. Still worth a look, but you might have the options of fast-forwarding to the really good parts. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5. 5 + 5 : « addictive and fun as a real game » (tv); I saw a little bit long ago and it seemed dull then. This time, i start another play right from the start and i found it still dull : the young boy appears a bit dumb, his wealthy family not better ",
       " And then, first comes teen Dunst and i'm really surprised how good she acted (as she never convinced me as Peter's girlfriend). Next, Robin gets in the movie getting out the game and the magic operates : i really like the way past, present and future merge, how the game expands to the big mansion into town. If the special effects looks very tired, the story is original, full of surprises and proves that a humble cast can do as fine as a multiple billion dollars one ! Robin proved one more time he was a never grown-up kid with a beautiful soul with kids and the key to childish fun ! So i had a great time with this small movie as it gives me all i ask to cinema : to find a way to leave (cautiously) my world behind !! Decent adventure; Well where do I begin. The Casting: I guess the casting was OK. Robin Williams does a decent job, same goes for Kirsten Dunst. I really love the Sara Whittle character, but I am unsure if its because of her written dialog, which I indeed love, or the acting of Bonnie Hunt. I don't know what role the policeman is supposed to play however. I mean he doesn't do anything really important and it seems like he is there just to tie up the loose ends. It is OK though, I would rather have this cop around than just having them loose the game some more, which I think would have been the other alternative. His supposed to be funny moments however is something the movie could've done without. The Story: I really enjoy the story! Its simple, not to serious and perfect for adventure. My problem with it is how the story about the characters end which is a bit counter dramatic. The moral of the story, whatever you perceive it to be, feels meaningless. Since everything just ends up a-okay for everyone. Some people have been complaining that you never get to know the origin of Jumanji or how it looks inside the game. I don't have that problem simply because it would take away all the mystery. The parts of the story I grow tired off is how they loose the game to often. I figure its to add suspense which works at times, but the movie overdoes it. Another thing that I don't really like is how Van Pelt, the hunter, has to buy a new modern rifle. I kind of liked the retro feeling to him, but that disappears when he has an enormous automatic black rifle with night-vision aim rather than his own old rifle. The effects: To be honest, what comes first in my book is acting and story. If you take the old batman movie the effects aren't at all impressive. But that don't stop them from being awesome. Same goes for this, sure the computer effects haven't aged well and the monkeys just look stupid. But it isn't that big a part of the movie. Maybe of the marketing but I've learned you have to take that part of the entertainment business with mountains of salt. I figure I got to much to say about the movie, there is a lot of stuff I haven't talked about, so I'll just stop here and sum my thoughts up. Its imaginative and adventurous with good acting and decent effects. The only part which stops me from giving it a 10 is the \"comic relief\" which is just stupid and unnecessary. A bit more adult sprinkled on this movie and it would be a lot better in my eyes. Still, a good movie! The end is near!; 'The end is near' was my best thought after an hour of Jumanji. The end of the movie that is. Despite a lot of good reviews of people I hardly know, this film is a first-class let-down. It is the somanieth movie in which Robin Williams comic qualities are abused. The story is about a game, Jumanji, that has come to life. After every move something terrible happens; a stampede or a giant spider attack. The game has to be finished to stop all terrible things happening. Of course Williams' comic talent and the special effects try to safe the movie but everything is overdone. By memory, I recall that the makers promised great special effects; they had used the same effects as Jurassic Park! Yes, they did, but they obviously only got the demo version of the package. Also, poor Kirsten Dunst, having the role of a nice young girl, is transformed is such a prig that all her good intentions fall into nothing. All in all, if you have to choose between watching this movie and cleaning up the house, please clean up your house starting with trashing the video of this movie. Good for children; beautiful film. As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is \"better\" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. A dark, mysterious, and entertaining childhood favorite of mine; Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good. review for jumanji.; This 1995 film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game 26 years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are 8+ as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than 8 and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark The jungle; This is an excellent movie for all ages. Congratulations to the cast, production, stunts and all the people. And now I want know what's happen in the jungle when Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) was there for 26 years. This should be a good adventure. Wish they had more Jumanji history; My only real complaint with Jumanji is where did this game come from? Who created it? I really wish they could have discovered more about the game's past, it's history. Then it would have made a little more sense. But I'm not saying I didn't like it. On the contrary, I do enjoy it very much, I think it's a cool buried treasure. The characters, the story, the effects all perfect. The cast does a great job in this movie and the concept of a strange magical board game works. I wish there was more monster animals. But the man eating plant and the giant spiders is enough to put it on my page. Robin Williams does great in this first monster movie, wish he do more. But that's just me. Anyway, in conclusion ladies and jelly spoons. This is an assume movie and you can do much worse then Jumanji. 8 STARS. An awesome movie...; This movie is great. The story is so interesting and unique. The cast do a great job of portraying their characters and the visual effects aren't bad for the mid-ninties. Some people say they don't like this movie, for whatever reason, but I think it's an enjoyable adventure that anyone would enjoy. This movie is about a board game. A very special board game. When two children play the game, everything that the their players do, happens to them. So when Alan's piece gets a card saying he has to wait in the jungle, he disappears, which nearly drives the young girl he was playing with mad. Twenty-six years later, two new kids play the game, and release Alan. Alan and the kids must get the other play to continue to game, otherwise they won't be free until it's completed. Best part of the movie: When Alan comes out of the game. Worst part of the movie: The spiders. Recommended for: Everyone. Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Amazing. Decent family entertainment; On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children. Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it. Fun little movie hidden in the back drawer; Movie plays. In comes zoo. Who's that laughing? Why it's you! Jumanji never made a big splash (though the PR engine tried its best) but it's a clever little fantasy about a magical board game that changes reality. The special effects are laughable and enjoyable at the same time, particularly the stampede, and altogether it's a fun jaunt. Surprisingly, considering that the rest of cast is mostly up-and-comers, Robin Williams doesn't dominate the film, but adds the right touch of insanity to the whole affair. But, like many Williams vehicles, there's a heavy \"let children be children\" component, as well as a domineering father figure who somehow just can't show his love for his child. Ignore all that, and just enjoy the game. 7 of 10 from me. The Disney movie that could have been; Hunt and Williams play the parts of shellshocked-delayed stress syndrome surviviors quite well. The story is entertaining and engrossing, with both elements of light and darkness. The effects-well, they DO look a bit unreal-and perhaps that is for the best-it adds a sense of unreality to the story -after all, these things come from a board-game universe! Even Van Pelt looks a bit CGI...and Bebe Nuewerth is a sweetie. An entertaining adventure movie; The thing that grabs people about this movie is the computer effects. They are supposed to be of a very high quality and very realistic. I must digress at this point because when I saw this movie recently I discovered that the effects were not as great as they are made out to be. In fact, the lion looked quite out of proportion and the monkeys looked quite fake. I think that they pushed themselves to a point where they could not do any better. Even though some of the effects were quite irritating, I did enjoy Jumanji. It is an adventure movie with everything, a stampede, deadly insects, lions, floods, earthquakes, and even a psychotic hunter with a very big gun. What makes this adventure movie different is that it is not set in the middle of Africa but rather in a quiet New England town, that is quiet until all of these things are unleashed upon it. The film begins in 1969 where little Alan Parrish is running away from bullies. He goes to his father's factory and notices a chest in one of the construction sites. Opening the chest he finds the game Jumanji. He takes it back home and plays it with his friend at which he promptly disappears. Fifteen years later, another two children find the game and decide to play it and release poor Alan Parrish. Having done that they realise that they must finished the game and revert everything back to normal. The interesting thing that I see in this movie is the difference in the time between 1969 and 1995. In 1969 everything is nice and everybody is friendly, with the exception of the bullies. Business is booming and the town is lovely and clean. This changes in 1995 for when Alan walks through the town we see a very different place. The once clean town park is now a squat for beggars, most of the shops have closed down and the Parish Shoe company has been abandoned. Alan Parrish spends 16 years in a jungle to emerge in a world that has completely changed. As is typical of Hollywood, everything reverts back to its original form at the end, which deludes us with the idea that we can return the world to the good old days. This is something that we cannot do. The pleasant memories of our past will always remain there, and as is seen in Jumaji, not everything about the past is all that pleasant. We can look forward to a time when everything is restored, but this restoration goes back to the time of the Garden of Eden. The perfect world of Eden will be restored, rather than our pleasant childhood memories. I still like this movie though. Robin Williams is not one of my most favourite actors, but he does not turn me off as actors such as Van Damme do. Rather, he is reasonable. It is not him that attracts me to the movie, but rather the story. The story is an adventure and it is what you get. Jumaji basically delivers what it promises. Very enjoyable fantasy adventure.; Jumanji starts in 1969 in New Hampshire in New England where a young boy named Alan Parish (Adam Hann-Byrdd) &amp; his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) starts playing a strange board game called Jumaji that Alan found buried in the ground earlier, Jumanji turns out to be magical &amp; Alan is sucked into the board game while Sarah runs off. Twenty six years later &amp; it's 1995 &amp; Alan's old house has been empty for years until now, until young brother &amp; sister Judy (Kirsten Dunst) &amp; Peter (Bradley Pierce) move in with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), the two youngsters find the Jumanji game &amp; start playing it themselves as all manner of creatures &amp; climate events begin to appear as does Alan (Robin Williams) who has spent the last twenty six years trapped inside Jumanji &amp; is now an adult. The only way to reverse the effects of Jumanji is to finish the game so with a now adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) the four players must battle whatever Jumanji throw's at them including Lions, Monsoon's, giant Spider's &amp; a stampede... Girected by former special effects man Joe Johnston this oddball fantasy adventure is actually pretty good but there are one or two things that ultimately drag it down to merely a very good film rather than a great film in my opinion. Based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsberg the film is apparently quite different &amp; the two main character's here Alan &amp; Sarah don't even appear in the book, Jumanji is a hard film to categorise as it mixes various ideas &amp; themes like a bad childhood, finding redemption, standing up to your fears, fantasy, sci-fi, horror &amp; comedy. At 100 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace, once it gets going the situation just keeps getting worse &amp; worse as all the chaos &amp; mayhem escalates beyond anyone's control with all sorts of animals running around &amp; the theme of facing your fears is an ever present one. I am not sure there is another film quite like Jumanji &amp; to find something so original &amp; different in a mainstream film is unusual but the CGI effects scenes, the lack of character depth, the refusal to do anything with the plot other than destroy a house &amp; an ultra happy ending which goes on forever that gives every character in the film the best most happy ending is pure Hollywood that was not needed &amp; a slightly darker ending in keeping with the slightly darker tone of the film overall would have been much better. To be honest apart from great set-pieces &amp; the basic concept there's really not that much to Jumanji at all, it's rather shallow &amp; it's attempts at depth are pure heavy handed Hollywood cliché but it's fun &amp; very entertaining while it lasts, just a shame about the last ten minutes really. Jumanji was made just as the CGI computer graphic revolution was taking off back in the mid 90's but the effects do hold up rather well actually, from huge plants to an impressive stampede of Rhino's &amp; Elephant's through a house to a huge Lion with the mischievous Monkey's probably the only real weak effect. As a fairly light hearted fantasy adventure with some darker overtones there's a few amusing moments including a bemused policeman who's car is slowly &amp; systematically trashed &amp; as a whole the film delights in needless destruction &amp; mayhem which is no bad thing. There are some laughs &amp; a few scares as well &amp; I could definitely see Jumanji appealing to both older &amp; younger audiences. With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 this had a very healthy amount spent on it with most going towards the effects I would have thought. Filmed in New Hampshire &amp; British Columbia in Canada. Despite being known as a manic performer Robin Williams is pretty restrained here &amp; his brand of psychical comedy isn't used much, Kirsten Dunst is one of the few child stars to go on &amp; have a successful adult career while the acting generally is pretty good. Jumanji is a unique fantasy adventure that I think would appeal to both children &amp; adults, my only real problem is the sweeter than sweet happier than happy ending which is pure sentimental Hollywood at it's worst. With an ending more in keeping with the rest of the film Jumanji might have got a seven from but as it is it gets a six, good but not great. Followed by Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005) which was shot under the title Jumanji 2. Jumanji; I think that kids would like this movie better then grownups. I loved this movie but my mom thinks the plot is to low. The movie is based on the book Jumanji and is a lot more deeper then the book. My bother thought that the movie was corny and the special effects were so bad they were funny but what does he know? OK maybe the effects were bad but whatever. I mean the movie was made along time ago so give them a break. I thought the movie was really good and the acting was great. Its the kind of movie that if you like it you watch it again and again and again. When I was sick I saw it 4 times and I still thought it was good. All and all I would give this movie a 9. I think that kids would like to see it. One word - fun! **mild spoilers**; B   \"Jumanji\" is, simply put, a fun, family-oriented action/adventure film.  From the killer plants to the CGI stampede and monkeys, to character actor Jonathan Hyde's (\"The Mummy\", \"Titanic\", \"Anaconda\") dual role as Alan Parrish's (Adam Hann-Bird/Robin Williams) father, and the ruthless man hunter Van Pelt, this is a gung-ho \"Indiana Jones\"-type film for kids. The plot is basically two sets of kids who discover a board game that makes the events that occur in them (killer mosquitoes, monkeys, etc.) come true.  Robin Williams plays Alan Parrish, a boy who got trapped in the game as a kid, with Bonnie Hunt as the girl who was with him and later, his love interest.  Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce play the two kids from 1995. I'll take my previous statement back - the film is more slapstick than \"Indiana Jones\".  A lot of the humor is physical or sight gags - eg. the monkeys riding a motorcycle with a pistol, which IS pretty damn funny, and the rows of supplies knocking over paint cans that bury Van Pelt. The film is suspenseful, well-produced, and has good special effects.  No, I'll take it back.  The monkeys and the lion look really fake (the stampede works since it would be hard to film a real one), but otherwise, they're okay. Aside from the fake-looking animals and the way-too-drawn-out ending, \"Jumanji\" is superb. Seven stars. Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a 10/10. Jumanji is fun!; What a great movie and a clever concept! A board game that sucks you into it, and must be finished by the originals who played the game. I remember seeing Jumanji in the movie theatre when it first came out, and this past weekend had the opportunity to rewatch it (thank you resale DVDs!) Starring Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, the action is fast paced and easy to follow. No swearing in this movie makes it appropriate for all ages, though little ones might be frightened by the rampaging animals. There is nothing Disneylike in their qualities. Still, the story of sticking together and teamwork prevail throughout the entire film. Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Greier are great in their supporting roles. Bonnie Hunt gets some of the best lines in the film with regards to cheating and a downtown sale. An early Kirstin Dunst is also great. If you have never seen Jumanji, I encourage you check it out. It's fun and you always wonder what the game is going to come up with next. LOVE THIS MOVIE!; Last night, May 2,2003  this movie was on again........no matter what other show we might be browsing at the time, we invariably start watching Jumanji,,,,,,we enjoy the hilarity and antics of all the characters,  it's done for shear  fun and entertainment, and we don't care if the special effects may be outdated,  we still consider it one of the best! So there! :-) Two  Happy Fishes  from oHIo Early CGI Makes the Monkeys Look Fake! Otherwise It's Amazing!; An enchanted board game breaks into the real world and the only way out of it is to finish the game! The monkeys look \"washed-out\" and so do some of the wild zoo animals; which is why most of the rest of the EFX are mechanical or use backdrops and mattes. Otherwise a very strong 10 would be my vote, as the casting works and the plot shows lots of imagination and flair. With a \"sly wink\" to \"Peter Pan\", Alan's father plays both his dad and Van Pelt the Hunter. My two favorite scenes are when the house gets folded in half and eaten by the monstrous plant, and when everything swirls backwards into the gameboard. I also love it when the house goes \"wild\" and turns into a swamp complete with nasty alligators. I do not like the scene where the little boy turns into a monkey with a tail. Young children may find it disturbing like the donkey transformation in \"Pinocchio\". \"Jumanji\" is suspenseful and scary but no one actually dies in the film. Therefore, it's much more enjoyable when viewed again. The only one who seemed to hate it was Roger Ebert, but it's only too scary for pre-schoolers. Most \"users\" love it! What \"scares\" me the most in this film: the bats, insects, spiders, alligators, and The Hunter. The sequel will not have the charisma of the late and great Robin Williams. I still miss him. He was a comic genius. If there was a market for it, I would like it to be re-imagined with better graphics like the old \"Star Trek TOS\" reissue. Entertaining family/adventure/fantasy; Released in 1995, \"Jumanji\" is fun movie about a mystical board game from the 1800s, which is found in 1969 leading to the mysterious disappearance of a rich boy. The game is discovered again in 1995 by two orphans (Jonathan Hyde and Kirsten Dunst) who play the game and bring back the lost boy now an adult (Robin Williams). The only way they can stop the havoc the game causes is to finish it. Bonnie Hunt, David Alan Grier and Bebe Neuwirth are also on hand. Patricia Clarkson has a small role. \"Jumanji\" is a great example of the way youth adventures should be done. It's entertaining from beginning to end for children, teens and adults. If you've lost sight of your inner-kid give \"Jumanji\" a try. What makes it worthwhile for adults, besides simply being fun, is that it contains compelling themes and everything ties-up for a moving climax. Plus Bebe Neuwrith looks great (she played Frasier's psychologist babe on Cheers). The movie runs 104 minutes and was shot in Maine, New Hampshire and the Vancouver, British Columbia, area. GRADE: B+ Imaginative (spoiler); This is probably one of the most imaginative movies I have seen in a while. I mean, it has an entire back story, as we can see in the beginning, when those two kids are trying to get rid of the game. Then it goes to 1969, when Alan finds the game, he and Sarah start playing, and he gets sucked into Jumanji. Then, throughout the rest of the movie, Alan comes out of the jungle and he, Sarah, Judy, and Peter continue playing the game and unleashing all these dangerous animals (and Van Pelt) and the monsoon and killer plants into the city. And at the end, those kids in Japan find the game. Very well thought out. Certainly worth a look. Fun!; I give this movie a ten on ten. I may be biased as I watched this movie when I was ten and whenever I watch it, it brings back fond memories of lazing around and watching movies during my summer vacations. But I am surprised that the overall rating for this movie is 6.5 (when I write this review), I expected it to be at least 7. This really is a fun movie to watch with some hilarious scenes. The monkey bike riding scene stands out it particular. The special effects looked good when I was young but now the fake animals are not very impressive. Jurassic Park was made before this movie and had much better special effects. Robin Williams does seem too old to play a 35 year old Alan Parish but he is a brilliant actor and you do not mind accepting him as Alan. Bonnie Hunt does a good job too as the paranoid Sarah Whittle. The kids do a great job too, especially Bradley Pierce; look out for the scene where he is searching for an axe. And David Grier is brilliant as the bumbling sheriff Carl Bentley. I suggest you watch this movie with your family on a weekend. Its worth it! My first crush on  Kirstin Dunst...; When this movie came out during the holiday season in 1995, I enjoyed it very much seeing it in SDDS and 35mm at the Sony in Wayne with my family and loved the effects. I even had the VHS for awhile. This is a good movie to test your surround sound system to the limits. The book was good, and the movie is better, but the TV show sucked. With the upcoming reboot replacing the board game with a video game coming out later this year, it's time to revisit this legendary Robin Williams family classic for the first time. An entertaining family film.; This film talks about a board game set in the inhospitable jungles of Indonesia that recreates magically the dangers in the board, for horror of the players involved. Directed by Joe Johnston, the film has a script by a team led by Jonathan Hensleigh. The main protagonist is Robin Williams, assisted by the young Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Yes, the theme of the movie would make a great horror film but, in this case, we have a comedy. And Robin Williams was definitely the \"Mr. comedy\". Any comic role fit him like a glove and this film was no exception. Although his character have some psychological depth, because of the trauma of being alone in the jungle for decades, it only serves to accentuate the humorous slant of what he says and does. The script is interesting, simple and very imaginative. The story works, entertains and holds the audience. The film scares a bit in certain scenes, but never in an excessive dose for children. The scenarios are good and the special, visual and sound effects are excellent. Some creatures in the film are clearly false and have a funny look. The soundtrack is regular, not bringing surprises, but doing their part without blemish. This film was made to entertain the audience, in particular the families, and does it very well.</td>\n",

       "      <td>OLDER, HORNIER AND STILL FRUSTRATED IN MINNESOTA;  `Grumpier Old Men' is a film that is a sequel to `Grumpy Old Men.' Reprising their original roles are Jack Lemmon as John Gustafson, Walter Matthau as Max Goldman, Ann Margaret as Ariel, Burgess Meredith as John's father, Kevin Pollock and Darryl Hannah as the children of Max and John. They are still next-door neighbors, only now the feud has subsided. Their children are living across the street in Ariel's house.  The marriage of their children is on the horizon. The setting for this film is summer and fall in Minnesota.  Fishing is still the main sport where `Catfish Hunter' is still the elusive prize.  The bait shop on the lake has been closed since Chuck passed away.  It is now under new management.  John and Max are anxiously waiting the reopening.  To their surprise, it is not being reopened as a bait shop, but a ristorante (restaurant).  Here enters Sophia Loren as the new proprietress Maria Sophia Calotti Ragetti.  Ann Guilbert who plays her mother joins her.  When Max and John find out the new plans for their favorite bait shop, they set out to undermine her plans for a grand opening.  A series of misunderstandings set off a domino effect that touches everyone's lives.  New loves are found and an old feud is rekindled. All of the same emotions that were in the previous film are in this film. There is laughter, sadness, anger and happiness.  Catfish Hunter makes his film debut, which, in essence, puts a `face' with a name.  His film appearance pays credence to the fact that he is a `real' fish and not just a myth.   The acting in this film is superb both by human and non-human.  Cute sequel that works; Fun story of two older men who never quite outgrew boyhood, and the ladies they love. What a treat to see two master actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, working with silly material and enjoying every minute of it. The lady loves, Ann Margret and the ever-sexy and dazzling Sophia Loren, do equally well with a lightweight, sometimes over-the-top script. The principals are aided by a uniformly fine supporting cast, including Burgess Meredith as the Lemmon character's outrageously lecherous dad, and Ann Morgan Guilbert as Sophia's feisty mama. The older players' interaction is a delight. My only quibble with this film is the fact that Meredith's character dies without getting married like everyone else. Why? I wondered whether Meredith had perhaps expired during filming, but, according to Wikipedia, the actor lived a whole two years following this movie's release! The original film, \"Grumpy Old Men,\" takes place during a picturesque Minnesota winter, with snow used to charming effect. The follow-up capitalizes on a Midwestern summer. Like apples and oranges, both productions satisfy. More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in 1995, 2 years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie 8 out of 10. A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances...; A sequel to the thoroughly enjoyable Grumpy Old Men, 'Grumpier Old Men' is A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances. The sequel has the spirit of its prequel &amp; the amazing cast, led by the impeccable talents of the Late/Great Jack Lemmon &amp; the Late/Great Walter Matthau, are in full form! 'Grumpier Old Men' Synopsis: John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. 'Grumpier Old Men' works well as a romantic-comedy, as it has moments of humour &amp; subtle romance. I loved the prequel &amp; I must say, the sequel doesn't fail to deliver. The film has sustained its energy &amp; wit, that one would expect from it. Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is entertaining, although initially the pace is slightly slow. Howard Deutch's Direction is top-class. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is good. Editing also is ably done. Performance-Wise: Lemmon &amp; Matthau shine all through. Its their sheer on-screen chemistry, that alone is worth watching the entire film. Sophia Loren is top-notch. Ann-Margret is impressive. Kevin Pollak &amp; Daryl Hannah leave a mark. Late/Great Burgess Meredith is memorable in his part. On the whole, 'Grumpier Old Men' is a smooth, relaxing watch. Oh, How The Mighty Have Fallen...; GRUMPY OLD MEN (3 outta 5 stars) GRUMPIER OLD MEN (2 outta 5 stars) I dunno why I even bothered to watch the second one. Oh, I guess because it was on cable TV shown as a double bill with the original \"Grumpy Old Men\". I liked the original when I first saw it. It was not the best work by the Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau team... but it had its moments... these two actors could probably read pages from the phone book to each other and still make it funny. Unfortunately, the sequel has even FEWER of those moments. Still, I maintain that no movie with either Lemmon OR Matthau in it can be *totally* worthless. This is probably as close as they ever got, though. (Bear in mind that I have not yet seen their last movie together, \"The Odd Couple II\".) Practically the same plot as the first movie... Lemmon and Matthau play lifelong acquaintances and next door neighbors who are constantly bickering about fish and/or women. Burgess Meredith plays Lemmon's FATHER... and if you find old people talking dirty hilarious then you'll probably love his scenes (especially in the closing credits outtakes). Ann Margaret and Sophia Loren play the women in the grumpy guys' lives... hard to imagine that women as attractive as they still are would want anything to do with these two old dorks but, hey... I guess pickings are slim after 65. very funny.; This film has some of the funniest lines and it's a great comedy. One would probably think, even I, thought that this would probably happen between two older men who fight about the obvious: women, fish and each other. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are a perfect pair. Even though it's a comedy, the romance in it is on the clean side. Nothing too distasteful and the comic relief is still included into the romance, which gives it a continuous comic flow. Even though there is a serious part of the film where John's father passes away, after that scene the film is back to the comic feel, which is nice because there's no dwelling on the sad/serious scene. Nonetheless, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh hard. Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Snoozing sequel with the leads in need of some No-Doz; Woeful, disappointing sequel to 1993's hit \"Grumpy Old Men\" is more retread than follow-up. The two crotchety neighbors--Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--bicker over their children (who will soon be making the sparring oldsters in-laws!) and, of course, who has the better fishing skills. They stop trading insults long enough for Matthau to begin irritating a new woman in town, a fiery Italian who has just opened her own restaurant. Sitcom humor with a sometimes-raunchy twist that is no longer fresh. Almost worth-seeing for Sophia Loren's funny, lively performance, but everyone else looks a little sleepy. Ann-Margret (who married Lemmon's character at the end of the original) must've dropped in for a day and a half to complete her work. As the youthful couple, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah are also under-used. ** from **** The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Back For More!; CONTAINS SPOILERS John Gustafson and Max Goldman are back in their first adventure since their last. It's six months later and they're still fishing. All the snow has melted and the neighborhood looks very different. The boys are out to catch a giant legendary fish they've heard tell about.          These men would soon discover big changes happening. Like, their friend Chuck, who died in the last adventure, had operated the bait shop. Ever since his demise, it's been empty, but some people have come with plans to turn it into a ristorante (restaurant). They are: Mama Regetti and daughter Maria. John and Max don't want that to happen so they pull numerous pranks on the Regettis but they still won't leave.         Jacob Goldman and Melanie Gustafson contemplate matrimony. But have their doubts when their fathers insist on planning the event. But when the kids decide the wedding is off, John and Max are back at it. Pulling all sorts of foolish pranks on one another. Max steals John's outboard motor, John wrecks Max's fish net and has his cat scratch up Max's car seats, but Max sends a big dog through John's house. Ariel decides to leave for a while. John was in a real pickle. He tried asking his father for advice, but he had passed away; Max goes on a date with Maria and they decide they like one another.        Pretty soon, it's a wedding day. En route to the church, Max and John decide to fish for the giant musket they're so fond of. They catch it, but John says they must leave it in the lake out of respect for his father, so they do and rush to church. It looks like the wedding of Jacob and Melanie, but it isn't. They eloped. It's the wedding of Max and Maria. John planted Max's dog in the limo as they drive off.        Was this as good as the first? Sure. I'm sorry to say that the three main stars, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith are no longer with us. Meredith died in 1998, Matthau in 2000 and Lemmon in 2001, which is real sad. So it's guarenteed there will never be an Even Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple III. They were really funny men. Why do the good ones always gotta die? But anyway, if you're a fan of these men and you enjoyed the first one, then I recommend Grumpier Old Men! - Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. 7/10 stars. 1/10; this movie sucked! I hate it! It's so boring! The acting is so bad! Why does Sophia Loren's italian character talk english to her italian mother when they're alone? The script is so bad! It's so corny! Max and John fighting with the fishing things is so silly! This movie was never funny! It was painful to watch, i'm telling you! Avoid it! Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT 7 out of 10 Delightful acting and script but silly scenes...; Always delighting in Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, warmed by their aging and childish pranks, I enjoyed this film which is filled with delightful acting and fun script.It suffers, however,  from more than a few silly scenes. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10 A sequel that's equal to the original comedy; The first go round was such a hit, that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau got together for this sequel to the 1993 smash hit, \"Grumpy Old Men.\" And \"Grumpier Old Men\" is every bit as good as the first film. It has some new characters and the scene changes from winter to summer, then winter and spring. Most reviewers don't talk about the surprise of the wedding in the first film. And I won't do that for that film or this one. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) team up for a time in the movie to plan the wedding of their daughter and son, Melanie and Jacob (played by Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak). And, later, to try to thwart the conversion of their bait shop into an Italian restaurant. Sophia Loren is the added ingredient for much humor as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti. She's a cousin of \"Spaghetti\" Ragetti, whom John and Max know. Her mother is in the picture, Mama Ragetti, played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. And, grandpa Gustafson is back, with Burgess Meredith now a couple years older. He tells son, John, as they sit by the lake drinking beer, that he sometimes thinks God has forgotten about him. The hijinks and capers in this film include some hilarious pranks the two friendly enemies pull on the Ragettis. As with the original film, this one supposedly takes place in Wabasha, Minnesota. While it is a real town on the Mississippi River border with Wisconsin, the filming for this and the earlier movie was done in a number of places around that area of southeastern Minnesota. So, anyone going to Wabasha won't find the fishing lake, the town overlook or some other scenes shown in these films. With the 10 films they made together  especially the nine comedies, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have delighted audiences for decades. May they outlive Catfish Hunter and continue amuse people for decades to come. Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5. Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Loren is still hot; Grumpy old men was an OK comedy with a nice performance by Ann-Margret, but otherwise forgettable. This film, on the other hand, has some real comic touches that actually also have something to say about the aging process - and life really doesn't end until it ends. But first the bad news: Daryl Hannah. I've liked her in other films, but she is so flat in this, she's a distraction. She doesn't have the feel for these characters, not even her own, and so doesn't quite fit. She's not even credible as the mother of the young girl who is so important in her relationship to great=grand-dad Burgess Meredith. There must have been some plot device they could have come up with to leave her out of the picture altogether; oh, well. Now the really good news: Sophia Loren. I admit I have always had a crush on her since I saw Houseboat as a kid; and when I saw the shower scene in Arabesque, i couldn't sleep for a week. Her performance here is splendid (romantic comedy is one of her strengths, after all), but the really really good news is that she was past sixty when she made this film, and she looks hot enough to burn a young man's fingers! Really - if I'd been Walter Matthau in that bar scene, I'd have gone out with a heart-attack right there - and smiling. With an adequate script, and such superb actors, Deutsch wisely lets the formula roll on without interference. Consequently, whatever the short-comings there's plenty to remember fondly from this film. Oh, and don't miss the blooper-reel that runs under the final credits - Matthau and Meredith are having a grand old time. Oh, and Sophia Loren is still hot. A vibrant sequel that's still underwhelming; I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They seem to work perfectly together, and with a better script, this movie could be gold. We are taken back to Minnesota to re-visit the old grumps who now have to plan a wedding for their very plain and very boring children. There's a reason Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah have never had substantial film careers- they're very uninteresting actors. But I digress. If \"Grumpy Old Men\" built up it's laughs, \"Grumpier Old Men\" topples them down. The best moments of both films are when Lemmon and Matthau trade vicious insults at one another, and also play pranks on each other. But when this is taken away, we're suffering every old cliché in the book, including Walter's tiresome 'Wholey Moley' line which is used so much, it could be taken into context for a Shot Party (take a shot every time Matthau 'Wholey Moley''s himself). The other problem with this series is the fact that gorgeous women fall for these two farts. Roger Ebert made a very valid point in his review for this film- first Ann-Margaret moves into the neighborhood and marries Jack Lemmon. Now the even more gorgeous Sophia Loren has set her sights on the incredibly unattractive Matthau. And why? For concepts in the plot. There's no reason a woman as beautiful and intelligent as Loren would fall for the dull and disgusting figure Matthau is. I know this is a comedy, but come on now! All in all this sequel is peppier and a little more fun then the original, but both movies suffer from overblown dramatic passages that are not needed. We want to see the old guys go at it, not Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah. I laughed a lot at this movie- mostly at the incredibly underrated Bergis Meredith as the foul-mouthed Grandpa. Since all three main actors have passed, we'll never see them again. At least Margaret and Loren are still alive and kicking. I'd love to see their movie: \"Grumpy Old Widows\". Still having a good ol' time!; I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men back to back, so I could see both instead of my normal rent one sequel at a time ordeal. I just finished Grumpier Old Men this morning and was expecting a modest sequel, but it turned into a great sequel, pretty much to the point where I enjoyed Grumpier Old Men to Grumpy Old Men. Despite the fact that they use some old jokes, this was a fun plot and I thought the guys have gotten even funnier, including John's father, he's a little dirty, but so much fun to laugh at. John and Max are now best friends again and couldn't be happier with each other, their son and daughter are about to get hitched, and they are overwhelming with the wedding plans. Max is starting to get lonely though, since Chuck has passed on, the bait shop is given to two older Italian women, one lady, Maria, starts a little feud with Max wanting to turn the bait shop into a restaurant. But their anger turns into a hidden passion and they end up falling head over heals for each other, but Maria has some hidden skeletons in her closet. Grumpier Old Men is proof that you are never too old to fall in love or have your heart broken again. It was so sweet seeing Max fall in love with Maria, I loved their passion for each other, it was so fun to watch. John's father and Maria's mother were just so awesome and funny, they had such great chemistry! I would highly recommend Grumpier Old Men, it's a great comedy that once again touches your heart and tickles your funny bone. 8/10 It has it's moments; Howard Deutch decided he wanted to cash in on the success of Grumpy Old Men and it worked. The only problem to the sequel is that some of the cast seem to be a bit bored by the proceedings. The one liners are enough to make you drop your popcorn. Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon are a joy to watch as they continue to find ways to drive each other over the edge into insanity. And yet Deutch calms that insanity by giving us a quick glimpse into just how much these two men mean to each other when Jack's dad played by Burgess Meredith dies. Lemmon and Mathau are still at the top of their game in this film. In this film the Ann Margaret character is suppose to be the rock, the sound of reason, the calm in the midst of the storm. You believe she is until she has the insanity thrust upon her and is forced to react. For the most part Ann Margaret as well as Daryl Hannah seem bored throughout the entire film. Kevin Pollack is just as good in this sequel as in the original. Burgess Meredith is the scene stealer, he manages with dead pan accuracy to deliver some of the best one liners in the film. Ann Morgan Guilbert manages to match Burgess with her ability to respond to his one liners with shock and outrage befitting her character. And then you come to Sophia. Sophia is in her comfort zone here. Sophia is comfortable with the slapstick comedy and relishes it, she's in the movie, she's not walking through it. She's absolutely stunning to watch but at the same time she adds to the moment. She's as glamorous as ever but it doesn't get in the way. All in all a good follow up to the original. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. charming and funny light romantic comedy; It may be just me but I found Grumpier Old Men way way better than Grumpy Old Men. I laughed more and got involved in the plot much more. That it is totally 100% predictable every step of the way is only one of its charms... its how you get there where the fun is. And these actors turn in surprisingly memorable performances for such a slight film. I thought Sophia Loren turned in one of her most charming and funny performances, as did everyone else. The story was just more interesting and three dimensional than the first film and flowed more organically. The story line is simple ancient classic romantic comedy that these veterans had done so many times, it seemed for them like doing a well-known dance. The fun is not in surprises but in going through the old steps with joy. The actors move through their paces with simplicity and enthusiasm and the film actually captures very well the effects of love. The whole film hangs together and works in a way that, for me, the first one didn't. It gets airborne. It deserves a higher ranking than my seven except the story is a little too well-worn. It also allows the two protagonists to get a little more real with each other. Even the three charismatic animal actors get caught up in the spirit of fun. One thing about the film that gave me trouble was that all four women being courted in the film are talented, accomplished, strong and magnificent while all four of the men are hamstrung. I found it mysterious that these women, dropped by some miracle into this tiny town, would be so strongly attracted. funny funny; I, too, found the film very funny and until reading about it here couldn't remember who played the other woman with Burgess Meredith at the end of the film, the scene that made the whole film complete.  Without giving away what happened at the end of the film, the other woman was that gorgeous elder lady of many great films - Sophia Loren.  What a delicious surprise!  Good also for any old grumpy man! the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... not much fun; Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still combative while maintaining their truce. John is married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) now and his father (Burgess Meredith) is still spry. Everybody is chasing after the big fish Catfish Hunter. Meanwhile, their children Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are planning to get married. Newcomer Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in Wabasha to buy the bait shop and turn it into an Italian restaurant. It's a continuation that's missing much of the fun. It is contrived. It's great to see these great actors working together but that's all I got out of it. I found very few laughs. after you have seen the first there is no point seeing this one; After the fun of watching Lemmon and Matthau act like kids for less than 2 hours (i.e. from the first movie) I was satisfied, but then due to the success of the first movie the producers decided to give it another twirl, this time the story had the two starting off as friends thanks to the incidents that happened in the ending of the first film, but then some really really idiotic stupid reason, they were at it again. The movie was not funny as it was like a replay of the first, same pranks, similar plot and screenplay made this movie a waste of time. After getting a mate for John, they (the producers) decided to get a mate for Max, with nothing to write home about but a lame script that just showed no finesse or true plan, just the producers hoping to bank on the success of the previous movie. The main disappointment in the movie for me was Sophia Loren; her acting was just too weak for me to understand that she is a star. Everybody else in the movie even Burgess Meredith (who had Alzheimer's disease and this was his last motion picture appearance) was impressive, at least that I can give them. The movie is directed this time by Howard Deutch, who later worked with the duo in 1998 for Odd Couple II, Deutch other movies also have not been well received like Getting Even with Dad (1994) and The Whole Ten Yards (2004), which are basically the reason why I will not bother seeing My Best Friend's Girl. The movie plot carries on 6 months after the incidents of the first, where both John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) were getting prepared for the wedding of their children. Then a new arrival in town a beautiful lady by the name of Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) came in to change things by turning the towns bait shop to a restaurant. John and Max join forces to try and run the new lady out of town, but the issues between John and Max's children marriage plan caused both to reignite their feud as both refused to believe that their child was at fault. Only the ladies are alive till today (February 2013), as both Lemmon and Matthau died like half a decade after this movie release. Grumpier Old Men was a box office success in its own part, but a huge critical disappointment, as the movie cost 10 million dollars less than its predecessor and made like a million more in the box office. After you have seen the first there is basically no point why you should bother seeing this one, because it will stand in my mind as one movie I credit as a waste of time and talent. www.lagsreviews.com Funnier than the first!; This movie is downright hilarious with tons of good one-liners. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (may they both rest in peace) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max &amp; John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says \"Holy moly\" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor! As Good As The Original; Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\". I don't agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love \"Buddy Buddy\" and \"The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile. Pretty Dang Funny; John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. We often expect sequels to be weaker than the original. But sometimes we may be pleasantly surprised. In this sequel, the \"grumpy old men\" are still up to their old tricks, going after each other and teaming up to close down a restaurant. Some of it may be a bit far-fetched (in real life, a store owner would get the cops involved) but it's good fun. Sadly, the film has the distinction of being Burgess Meredith's final film. On the plus side, he really goes out with a bang. His acting and delivery of witty lines is top notch, and the film does a great job of hiding his Alzheimer's. You can really feel the talent in his character. Grumpy, but not funny; What, I wonder, does the legendary Billy Wilder think of this film starring Lemmon and Matthau, the great team he so memorably paired in 1966's \"The Fortune Cookie\"?  Wilder's film is a dark, cynical satire, and was the first of what is now seven films starring the pair.  Seven films, but only two of them--\"The Fortune Cookie\" and \"The Odd Couple\"--are genuinely funny efforts showcasing these actors' combined talents.  \"Grumpy Old Men\" was mildly amusing due less to the script than to the welcome return of Lemmon and Matthau who hadn't been on screen together in 12 years.  The unexpected box-office bonanza naturally inspired a sequel, but all this equally lucrative outing has in its favor is a brief monologue by Burgess Meredith who, as Lemmon's 95-year-old father, boasts of eating bacon and smoking Camels while the \"experts\" who warned against such vices are taking a \"dirt nap.\"  Not even Lemmon and Matthau can enliven the script by Mark Steven Johnson this time around.  The curmudgeonly Matthau admitted he didn't lke the script for the first film but did it to work with Lemmon, and that the only reason he did the sequel is because the first film was a hit.  No doubt, \"Grumpiest Old Men,\" the inevitable sequel, will be just as dreary. If these pictures make big bucks, why tamper with the formula?  Why hire Billy Wilder to punch up the quality when the public seems content merely to see Lemmon and Matthau rather than see them at their best? Is it better than original?; Is this movie better than the original? Perhaps. It's probably funnier than the original. Walter Matthau's pick-up line is one of the funniest things of the movie. But is it better than the original? The original had more of the emotions of Lemmon and Matthau as they fought. This one has less feuding (but still has some of the old pranks) and more focus on the family / dating relationships of the old men. This movie is funny and definitely worth watching. You'll have to decide on your own if it's better than the original. Mini Ha Has In Minnesota; It's just possible that the intention was to shoot four Grumpy Old Men titles featuring the four seasons because after the Winter setting of the first one we are now in Summer though theoretically such a cycle should have begun with Spring and ended with Winter so maybe the cyclical thing was an afterthought. Whatever we have virtually the same cast doing virtually the same thing with one absentee and two replacements one of which, Anna Guilbert is actually a native of Minneapolis adding a touch of authenticity. If it was unrealistic that Ann Margaret - who, after all, was teaching English at university and would by definition have access to dozens of eligible males - would marry Jack Lemmon in the first film it is equally unrealistic that Sophia Loren would wed Walter Mattheau here other than for feelgood reasons. On the other hand it's probably churlish to nitpick in this way when the film is only intended to entertain. Which it does. As equally funny as the original, but with an Italian flair!!!!; This sequel to Grumpy Old Men is as funny as the original. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and the rest of the cast from the original movie reprise their roles. John and Max are still feuding, but the tension between them has softened. There are, however, some changes: Ariel and John are married and there's a new girl in town named Maria Ragetti. She's moved to Wabasha to open up an Italian restaurant at the former Chuck's Bait place. When the boys discover what Maria's intentions are, they hatch a scheme to ruin the grand opening of the restaurant and try to keep Chuck's business going, even though the inventory of the former business has been cleared out and the interior remodeled to look like an Italian restaurant. Max and Sophia meet, but there's a disagreement about what the place should be. Maria goes to the neighborhood bar to try and reason with Max, but to no avail. It seems as though Max and John have trouble saying goodbye to what is no longer there. The humor between Lemmon and Matthau's characters is still spiced up and is still able to put viewers in stitches. Then, Max and Maria get married, and the restaurant starts selling bait, as well. Great movie, great cast, great fun!! Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. 2/5 stars - John Ulmer \"Good Lemmon &amp; Matthau Comedy Sequel!\"; Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Kevin Pollack, Daryl Hannah and Burgess Meredith star in this 1995 comedy sequel. This takes place about 6 months later where John (Lemmon) is now married to Ariel (Margret) and he and Max (Matthau) are sort of getting along. This time, Max finds romance when he meets Maria Ragetti (Loren), an Italian widow who moves into town and opens a restaurant. Jacob (Pollack) and Melanie (Hannah) are also engaged and things start to get a bit difficult for them which makes their dads feud with each other, but only temporarily. The late, Meredith (Rocky) also returns as John's father and this was his final film. This is a good sequel and like the first film, it provides laughs and a bit of heartfelt moments as well. I recommend this. The good, the bad, and the just plain miserable...again; It's not uncommon for a movie sequel to do little to the formula that made its predecessor so financially (and hopefully critically) successful. The old \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" method of filmmaking has been used in the Hangover, Home Alone, and Taken franchise to only modest success in terms of quality. However, in Grumpier Old Men, the sequel to the fine comedy Grumpy Old Men, handles the rehashed formula better than many film sequels do. While I'm getting to sound repetitive and out of descriptive words, this is largely because of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's chemistry together on-screen. From the moment they appear, it's almost impossible to believe the men's friendship in real life wasn't lifelong and consisted largely of playful torment, vulgarity, and several boys nights out. Had the film been a sequel with few returning cast members (say Lemmon and Matthau were substituted by two other actors), this sequel would've likely been a somber affair to view. In a way, I'm thankful the town of Wabasha Minnesota hasn't really changed much since our last outing, with the exception of John Gustafson (Jack Lemon) marrying Ariel (Ann-Margret) from the original film. In the meantime, John's dad still lives off a diet of beer, cigarettes, and bacon and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), John's cantankerous neighbor, still finds himself engaging in petty neighborhood battles with John about outwitting the other man. However, the big ordeal this time is not competing for a new neighbor's love but trying to save a local bait shop from becoming a \"restaurante\" for Italian cuisine. The restaurant is managed by Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren), a gorgeous but uncompromisingly strict woman who catches the eye of Max even as him and Jack plan to foil the restaurant's forthcoming prosperity. Other events (aka subplots) occurring in Wabasha are the wedding between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah), a plot which would later be used by the same director Howard Deutch in The Odd Couple II, also starring Lemmon and Matthau, along with John trying to get his father (Burgess Meredith in his final role, which was burdened by spouts with Alzheimer's and difficultly remembering lines, some female company as he gets older. One of Grumpier Old Men's immediate issues is that there is simply too much going on between plot-strands that involve marriage/romance troubles (I counted four including John's brief trouble with Ariel later in the movie) ad others that involve trying to sabotage the bait-shop-turned-restaurant. Grumpier Old Men may have too many new ideas for cutesy subplots, but it keeps the tone and feel of its predecessor alive and well. It still feels like Wabasha is the location of a sitcom with its oddball situations that seem to consistently bear hefty consequences for its residents, but its characters still feel like real people we've come to known and care about. Unsurprisingly, Lemmon and Matthau share unbelievable conversational beauty in the way they engage in simple discussions that seem to constantly end in uproariously funny bickering. Once you minimize your focus on that aspect in the film, you have just an average comedy that, while charming and pleasantly safe (a good and bad quality for this particular kind of picture), is just grateful to be buoyed by two very talented leading men. Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Sophia Loren, and Burgess Meredith. Directed by: Howard Deutch. Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life &amp; Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau &amp; Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman &amp; John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a 7.4 out of 10 Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. Grumpier Old Men (1995) **1/2; More of the same for those who enjoyed the first film, nothing great but a decent time killer. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return in their twilight years as the ever-battling duo, but this time with the added attraction of Sophia Loren who still looks gorgeous at age 60. She winds up posing a threat to their favorite bait and tackle shop when she decides to take it over and turn it into an Italian restaurant. Since Lemmon's already got sexy Ann-Margret as his hot girlfriend, Sophia hits it off with old man Matthau (ah, the magic of movies), who does not look as good for his age (75). Burgess Meredith is better used in this one in his role as Lemmon's naughty old pop. **1/2 out of **** Who would have ever guessed that it's the same place?; For the most part, \"Grumpier Old Men\" is pretty silly. Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still at each other's throats when Italian immigrant Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in town and throws everything into flux. What actually struck me most about the movie was how different the town looked in this one from the original. Obviously, it was a different time of year, but maybe the different look was meant to show how everything might be changing in the town. Other than that, Ann-Margret returns as Ariel, and she's still as free-spirited and vivacious as she was in the original. Burgess Meredith - in his final role - is still the grandfather who can exercise absolute authority over the youngsters, although he now has the hots for Maria's mother (Ann Morgan Guilbert, aka Millie on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\"). Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah also reprise their roles from the original...ah, and there's that fish. All in all, a fairly interesting movie. Not any kind of masterpiece, but it showed that Lemmon and Matthau still had it. Grumpier Old Men Too Sedate *; While Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were an excellent team, they bombed in this film but good. What's so grumpy about Lemmon in this film? The prequel was much better. Ann Guilbert, as Sophia Loren's mother, is given little to do. Remember her as the grandmother to \"The Nanny?\" Sophia Loren, other than marrying Matthau, is also give nothing to do. Ditto for Ann-Margret, Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak, all of whom were so good in the original but are reduced to practically nothing here. I also resent Matthau, who shows off his part-Jewish heritage marrying in a church at the end. I found this to be offensive. Sorry, but that's the way I am-old fashioned. To all those criticize me for the last statement, how would you have felt if the Matthau-Loren nuptials had taken place in a synagogue? While I realize that this was a comedy, this still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. A non-religious setting would have been the only solution to this. great; This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) Sweet and Sad; In this bright sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\" we find John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) at it again. The rivalry never stops. This time, they are bickering over their children's nuptials, almost causing a wedding not to occur. Sophia Loren co-stars as Maria in this foray into the land of 10,000 lakes as the new girl in town that Max has an eye for. At first, they both hate one another because she is turning his beloved tackle shop into a restaurant. Comedy ensues as Max and John both try to get the restaurant shut down and condemned. Eventually, as in the first film, love finds a way. However, sadness veils over as well when Burgess Meredith's character dies. Other than that, the film is very enjoyable. Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from 1995. The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe 8yrs old, and must have seen it over 100 x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it 15 minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. Great!; This is a rare sequel. Wait a minute, sequels aren't rare. Well, that's true, but a *good* sequel is rare. Most of the time, sequels aren't even in the same league as the originals. However, due to excellent writing, a superb cast and great direction, this film is every bit as enjoyable as Grumpy Old Men. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made several films together and they worked together extremely well. The gorgeous Ann Margaret reprises her role from the first film and is now Lemmon's wife. A new lady hits town and Matthau is very interested. This lovely creature is played by Sophia Loren, who is still stunningly beautiful. Burgess Meredith is great as Grandpa. The stellar cast ensures great acting. However, this film is also written such that there is literally a laugh nearly every minute. I found the film to be highly enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh. Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the 1st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. One of the best movies of 1995!; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter &amp; Jack's previous films together. It was this film &amp; the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max &amp; John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down. forget the fussing; As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Good Laughs; Grumpier Old Men (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to Grumpy Old Men have Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau returning with more fights and foul language. This time out Lemmon is still happily married but Matthau is on the move and takes a special interest in an Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved to town. I think the most remarkable thing about this film is how well Loren looked. Even at 61 she's still a head turner and her comic timing isn't too bad either. I'm sure this film was only made because the first one made money but it doesn't really matter as no one should take this too serious as it's just a silly comedy meant to make you laugh. There are plenty of nice laughs here but I don't think it's as good as the original. This certainly isn't in the league as The Odd Couple but we do get a pretty good throwback to that film here as there's a scene where Lemmon has to spend the night with Matthau but can't put up with his dirty house. Ann-Margret returns but is pretty much wasted as is Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak. The perverted Burgess Meredith is back and steals the scene every time he's in it. Both Matthau and Lemmon are naturally very good and they easily slip back into their roles. It's priceless watching the two men work together even when the material isn't as strong as one would hope. Lemmon gets a special notice here due to a very touching scene with Meredith. Another problem is the direction, which has one of those \"made for TV\" feels to it. In the end this film could have and should have been a lot better but the cast make it worth watching. Sophia, twenty years later at 80, is still spectacular.; I saw a picture of Sophia on her eightieth birthday, demurely covering herself with a sheet and a heart-melting smile. All I could think of was the scene where she hitched up her bra and marched through the bar, and every man looked, and I do mean every man. I read later that she had \"improved\" the script for that. A reviewer in the SF Chronicle wrote later that she said she had had no \"touch- ups\", and if so then \"her genes need investigating.\" I remember her many films where her beauty was so natural that it was a wonder any man could concentrate on his lines. She never traded on it, but on her talent as an actress. Carlo Ponti was a lucky man: beauty without guile, talent without pretense. Italian pizza were like street food. When she heard we had so many pizza parlors, she thought we must be a poor country. Then she visited, and dined on American pizza. She reconsidered, gracefully and graciously.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Decent; Those of you who ranted and raved about how horrible this film was really tickle my funny bone. I love to see miserable people hate a movie just because...well, they have nothing to better to do. Not saying this was the best movie I've ever seen. But I agree with others who say that Bassett and Levine are the ones to save this film from drowning with all the other horrible movies. I love Angela Bassett, I'm a huge fan of hers. The scene which depicts the morning after her husband leaves her for his secretary, which would've otherwise been too cliché for my taste had it not been for the way Bernie (Bassett) burned up that BMW! I mean that was classic. Sorry if any of you testosterone-fueled men out there will accuse me of man hating, but I love that scene and will watch it over and over again. Three cheers for Angie. And Devine's character, Gloria seems sort of weak and unable to stand up to even her teenage son, but I love how she bends a little and confesses how she feels to the late Gregory Hines' character. You'll notice Devine's Gloria and Bassett's Bernie are slightly juxtaposed but their chemistry is excellent. If you haven't seen it, check it out, if not for anything but the performance of these two gifted actors. Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" This film does Terry McMillan's writing no justice; This movie had great potential had it landed in the right directors hands (as seen with How Stella got Her Groove Back).  Many rough cuts, sloppy editing, and terrible lighting at times to name a few.  Casting was excellent with the exception of Whitney Houston who has the tendency to over-chew her scenes.  Though much of the book was not adapted to the film the strength and love amongst four friends was apparent.  It was the one thing that was not lost or left on the cutting room floor.  Good movie, better book. Waiting to Exhale (the movie) ***** (5 stars) Waiting to Exhale (the novel) ********** (ten stars) A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . Feel Good Movie; The acting in this film is phenomenal, especially on the part of Angela Bassett who always does an amazing job (see What's Love Got To Do With It). The inter-cuts work well where they are placed, much like all of the other shots, and keep the films pace and the viewer interested. I've read other user comments and I find their opinions to be completely biased and unwarranted. If you're watching this film looking for profound insight to life you will be disappointed. This film is an adaptation of Terry McMillan's critically acclaimed novel FOR BLACK FEMALES. Waiting to Exhale explores the lives of four female friends. Each woman makes mistakes and has to deal with those consequences. But it is through being there for one another that they overcome these problems and others. For me, most of the negative user comments are from people who the film was not made for, that are only analyzing the film from the story. There is more to a film than it's narrative and when base your full opinion on that alone you are missing out. Plus, for me, it's just flat-out annoying when people who are completely not the target audience bash a film. Note: this is not to say that art cannot breach color, age or sex barriers. But be let's be realistic for a moment. If say, a heterosexual, black, 21 year old female studying Art was asking you for a good movie suggestion for a Friday night...Would you suggest The Dukes Of Hazard? I think not. Not unless you were joking. Sticky; There was nothing in the movie that made me excited. The message did not come through,  if there was one. Perhaps it is to convey the idea that men are useless,  or that relations are complicated because women make it complicated. If a comedy,  I did not laugh.  If a drama,  I did not find it dramatic. It was like drinking a cup of coffee presented to you with way too much sugar. Whitney ruined the great potential; Angela Basset was good as expected, but Whitney has no Range as an actress. The screenplay also neglected to portray, on film, the greatness of this novel.  Instead of promoting sisterhood, they emphasized the canine-qualities of men.  Read the book; rent Soul Food instead! Excellent for the broken heart...; Perhaps the reason they call this movie a chick flick, is because that's exactly who it's aimed at. Women. I don't see this as a man bashing movie, but more as a \"how do you deal?\" type of movie. It covers every situation: The unworthy co-worker, The drug-addict boyfriend, the gay husband, the cheating husband, the married man, the New Years fling, the sweet attractive neighbor, the teenage son....but most importantly, it show how women react and deal with the lies, the cheating, and the friendships between both men AND women...and how to survive from that. Any woman who has ever gone through a relationship can relate to this movie, regardless of race, situation, or age. You will want to scream, cry and laugh throughout the whole movie, and I can guarantee that every woman has got a little Angela Bassett in her, especially when she rips through her ex-husbands belongings. Two thumbs up...A definite must-see for any woman with a wounded heart. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about 15 or 16 and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. A real disaster!; This movie is awful! The caracters are shallow and almost ridiculous, especially Lela Rochon. It's a very, very, very bad soap opera. I was watching this movie with my wife and we were laughing almost all the time. It is much too long, with no rhythm with absolutely no emotions. It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one cliché after another. Skip it, it's a waste of time! Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this 1995 film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Pathetic; This film is simply about a bunch of women who pick men who's behaviors they claim to hate &amp; then spend the rest of their time complaining about them. It seems that this view is held by many women &amp; possibly accounts in some measure to the number of women who consider their relationships with men to be unsatisfying. My favorite movie ever !; I'm so surprised by the comments i read here. Since i saw that movie maybe 10 years ago now, it's one of my favorite movie ever along with boomerang.Maybe it's because i was fairly young when i watched those movies.. but i find them extremely good. I watched the movie before i read the book and it may be the reason why i loved the movie so much. Sure Whitney's acting could have been better but she managed to do a pretty decent job overall. As for the soundtrack it's a pure bliss for RnB lovers and i would say a classic now. The image of Black men in the movie is very negative but in a sens it pushed to be the exact opposite so it kinda shaped my vision and my life, and \"deepend\" my love of black women. Some parts of the movie are just so classic like the break up between Robin and troy on the balcony and the soundtrack at that moment was some kind of a symphony.. anyways great great movie .. enjoy Extra in Movie; I was actually an extra in this movie and had a quite a fun time hanging out w/the cast/crew. I had an opportunity to be at several of the locations for days of filming and it was a lot of work. You don't realize what a day of filming entitles until you actually do it and I was just an extra. I was more interested in the process of the film making than being on camera so it was a great opportunity. I even got \"spoiled\" and met a lot of the cast and drove around in the SUV's that are for the main cast...fun stuff! I think over all the movie was to enjoy for fun. I think the basis of the friendships were the most important aspect of the film. That through all the craziness of men in their lives they were still there for one another. hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Hilarious in Parts; 1995 was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in 1995, the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker. 6 of 10 stars. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. in response to your response; I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :) I wanna move to Arizona; I thought It was a great movie, although it is a lot of sleeping with other women husband that are taken, we all have to be honest, this goes on a lot in reality. it's not right, but it happens.... Overall I really enjoy the movie because it took me way back to 1995, the movie was great. great times, although I was just 11 when it came out, I remember all the hype over this movie from my mom n my aunts.... One factor that I've never notice before was the setting... It makes me wanna pack up my family an move to peaceful Arizona.. Great Movie. r.i.p. Whitney Houston I cannot believe it took me all this time to see this movie all the way through... WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. I give this one 2 out of 10. FAbuLOuS; Simply fabulous. I thought it was a great movie. I was completely empowered! It made me want to start my exes car on fire. Embrace your independence  watch this movie. (is great to watch with the scorned over glasses of wine and bon bons) It'll make you laugh, cry, get mad, and then plot getting even. I can waste a lot of your time telling you to see it, defending it from what others say about it, or just generally talking it up. But haven't you always wanted to see Angela Basset throw a fit? How bout cut her hair off? And who wouldn't want to watch Whitney act with humility. This is by far my favorite movie with Whitney - second, The Bodyguard - third, The Preachers Wife. Frustrating...; That's the word I'd use to describe the film, an adaptation of Terry McMillan's 1992 best-seller. It's not great, it's not bad, but it's frustrating to watch, and the fact that I'm of the male persuasion undoubtedly had something to do with it. Now, let me be the first to say that I did enjoy seeing a group of strong black women portrayed onscreen. To say that Hollywood has been exceedingly lax in this regard is an understatement. But it would've been nice if their collective talents hadn't been squandered on this disgustingly anti-male tirade. Especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine, who otherwise shine in everything their names are attached to. Good, solid movies about sisterhood are probably needed now more than ever, but not at the cost of shortchanging the good, upright, decent brothers out there, whom this movie largely forgets about (with some notable exceptions -- Gregory Hines, for example.) And the frustration doesn't end there. Both Savannah and Robin manage to find themselves involved with the most shady characters (a married man and a dope fiend, respectively), yet they complain about the lack of good men out there. I suppose it would be silly to question just where they've been looking, even though it might hold the answer. The sad thing is that there are fellas out there who have little to no regard for women (\"the scum of the f__king earth\", to quote Savannah), and women who fall for fellas like that for the most silly, shallow reasons. If it wasn't for Bassett, Devine, and Babyface's score, this movie would barely be watchable. As it is, it's a moderately entertaining diversion, albeit a frustrating one. Don't Exhale Just Yet; I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It's not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others, it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However, the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria -- even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger, Holly Hunter, Alfre Woodard and others. Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight, insecure no-nonsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight, but she was the only one who found it (and deserved it). She was the only one who didn't sleep around, wasn't a man basher, set a good example for her son, and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face -- look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things, her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent, good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie. Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package --- beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life - she could now start her catering business, she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end. Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book, you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men. Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same -- Whitney Houston being well groomed, pretending to be well spoken and classy, and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise (although she might have been too young). The character had to tell us she was smart -- in a phone conversation with her mother she said \"I'm smart, I'm a good person and I work hard.\" Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills, doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end. This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn't \"tell this story\" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were. Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue? Sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE HARD TRUTH) looked VERY beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts REALLY made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Good movie, Better book; This wasn't a bad movie. The acting was great (although Whitney Houston still seems mediocre). Some of the scenes were powerful and funny. However, unlike the book which also deals with the sisterhood of Black women, the movie becomes a long \"Men are pigs\" tirade that gets weary after a while. Plus it's sometimes hard to root for the characters. For instance, considering all the one-night stands Savannah has, it's hard to see why she's questioning her ability to find a good man. Overall, Waiting to Exhale, is basically a sorely-needed bonding movie for African-American women that, while a little biased, is good escapist fun. Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops &amp; horrible movies. A One-Sided Celebration of African American Feminism; Directed by Forest Whitaker and adapted from a smash best selling novel by Terry McMillan, WAITING TO EXHALE is a glossy, but one-sided look at the relationship between four strong black women and the various men in their lives. The film is one-sided because the screenplay presents most of the male characters as sexist, manipulative pigs without a redeeming characteristic in sight, but the sensitive direction and outstanding performances keep the rather lopsided story watchable. Whitney Houston made an impressive film debut as Savannah, an ambitious television executive caught in a dead-end affair with a married man (Dennis Haysbert). Angela Basset does Oscar-worthy work as Bernadine, a woman who has spent her life being the best wife and mother she knows how to be, who has her world rocked when her wealthy husband (Michael Beach) calmly announces one night before a formal dinner party that he's in love with someone else and wants a divorce. The scene where Bernadine gathers all her husband's stuff and makes a bonfire out of it in her driveway is one of the film's highlights. Lela Rochon plays Robin, a not-too-bright doormat who finds herself pregnant by a man she wants nothing to do with. Loretta Devine is fun as Gloria, a hairdresser who is divorced from her husband, who it turns out was gay, and is struggling to raise her son (Donald Faison) and tries to begin a relationship with a new neighbor (Gregory Hines). If you can accept the fact that in the world of these four women, all men are pigs, then this film can be very entertaining but the top-notch performances by the cast cannot be overlooked. A bit too soapy but deserves respect for being a positive film for black women; Vannah is travelling to see her friend Bernie while leaving behind all her old live to start anew.  Bernie has just been left by her husband of 13 years for a white woman.  Robin wants to be loved and happy but always makes the wrong choices.  Glo has an estranged husband and the only man in her life is her teenage son.  The four get together through their struggles in love and live as they try to put it all together again. This is very much a woman's film and, as a man, it's easy for me to criticise it for being a weepy or for being a bit of a woman love in, so I won't.  The plot is pure soap opera, the lives and loves of our 4 women, however it is still involving as the four stories all have strengths as well as weaknesses.  The mix of comedy and sentiment is a bit too much 20:80 and at times the sentiment gets too much, but the sassy characters keep the interest. The soapy sentiment isn't helped by a poor soundtrack and poor use there of. In itself I like some of the love ballad r'n'b stuff  but here it felt like it was all over every scene.  This really bogs it down. Also a down side is the whole man hating thing  only a few come off looking good.  I thought the director being a man would help redress the balance but it seemed to have no effect. Why  can someone tell me  was Houston chosen to lead this talented black cast?  Was it because she could do a cut price soundtrack?  She's a poor actress and he spoiled her scenes  she needs to stay in TVM's.  Bassett however is powerful as ever and really steals every single scene she's in.  Devine adds comedy and sauce while Rochon is perfect as the vulnerable beauty going about love the wrong way.  The male cast is great too  there are so many well known faces in this with only two criticisms of them  1  everytime I see Haysbert now all I can think of is his 24 character.  And 2  Wesley Snipes' character just don't convince me at all. Overall to criticise this for being girly or sentimental is to miss the point.  It is actually good to see a film with so many good roles for black actresses.  It's a bit too soapy for my taste but it is funny and involving with a commanding Bassett.  Only Huston, a soppy soundtrack and constant man caricatures spoil it. Double Standard; So I finally got around to watching \"Waiting to Exhale\" on Encore the other night and I don't understand why this became a hit. (Note: spoilers ahead) As far as I can tell, the basic premise of this film is that all men are insensitive, callous and unfeeling; especially towards women. Okay, well and good. That is the storyline? Fine. Men suck, got it. But there is a huge double standard here; two of the women are dating married men and clearly, we are meant to be sympathetic about their plight as they whine and cry about not having \"their\" man with them at night in bed. How about this? STOP DATING MARRIED MEN! Maybe that's your problem in the first place. Now, on the flip side, Angela Basset's character is abandoned by her husband for another woman. Yet, if you pay attention, even this character is not completely innocent. When her husband informs her he is leaving, the things she says makes it clear she's known about his lover(s) for years but ignored his infidelities. Why? Obviously, because he's so wealthy. She liked all the \"stuff\" a little too much to have confronted him about it. Again, she's made her bed here, not as completely as the two who are actively cheating, but still. She spends the rest of the movie being so angry that he left her you never really grow to like her. Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer; he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar. With their clothes on, which apparently means it's oh-so-platonic and sweet. Then he writes her a letter months later, thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off, he'll contact her again. Did anyone else think this was more than a little sleazy? I would hope if I were dying of breast cancer that my husband wasn't out sleeping around (and I do mean just sleeping) with other women. Sweet, platonic, whatever; I think it's pretty horrible. Bottom line; the characters you're supposed to connect to are unlikable and the ones you're supposed to hate are just pathetic. Not very enjoyable. However, I did give it three stars for the music, which didn't suck too badly and the clothes and style. It's a nice little snapshot of how things looked in '95. And the print wasn't very faded. That's about it, though. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Hot Soundtrack, Terrible Character Development; Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end.  It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.  However, much of this is wasted on poor character development.  Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover.  What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies.  While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all.  For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script.  Clearly the answer is that it isn't.  Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with.  Why the director didn't see this, I don't know. Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface. 4/10 Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. A 3 is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. not bad; this movie and its story are quite good on the whole..........Ms Bassett is the leading and the best actress,for sure.I get her character.she's beautiful and I guess she's blown people away with her beauty and the EASE WITH WHICH SHE FASCINATES.Ms HOUSTON IS NOT TO NEGLECT NEITHER.She looks natural in this one.And despite her little experience as far as her actress career is concerned,she is good even though her story is a bit common .Loretta is divine!Anyways,this motion picture is merely good.There's nothing amazing.And it don't stand out from all the other movies.the only thing that makes me stick to the screen is the complicity and the crude humor on men of the four ladies! Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life. Please. great touching story; While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life's mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation. WAITING TO EXHALE : Waiting To Go Somewhere, But Sadly It Never Does...; WAITING TO EXHALE Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. \"Waiting To Exhale\", Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book, had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it's star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene. \"Waiting To Exhale\" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone. It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn't know the word \"feelings\" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change. For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they've experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don't seem to learn squat. It's like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. \"Waiting To Exhale\" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose. ... D ... Great female flick of the '90s!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track 6: This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A (Rare) Good Sequel; The first \"Father of the Bride\" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin's great comedic \"Dad\" character with the emotions of marrying off his \"only\" (to that point!) daughter. However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor. Thankfully, \"Father of the Bride II\" does not fall into this trap. With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather. Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton). Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women! Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments. Whereas the first film captured George's equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George's identity crisis. With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family. Overall, this film is just as good as the original. The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare. Let's just say that if a \"Grandfather of the Bride\" were in the works, I would be first in line. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in 1995. It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. 2.5 out of 5 stars. Deja Vu; I found this sequel to be both charming and entertaining. What I learned tonight is that this movie is actually a remake of the 1951 movie \"Father's Little Dividend\", which in turn was the sequel to the original \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and with the same great cast: Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Bennett, et al.  They both share the same broad comedy and story line (only one pregnancy in the earlier version though), and in their own ways are equally entertaining.  Old or new incarnations, however, be sure to see parts one and two in sequence. Better than the original; This one is definitely better than the original, funnier, smoother pace, and in some places, better acting! Plus Martin Short has more screen time. Great! This is a great movie for anyone who like good clean comedy. Awesome! Five out of Five Moose Stars! Father of the Bride II; Likable, but not as impressive a follow up to the 1991 hit with Martin now dealing with his daughter being pregnant...And, oh yeah...his wife is pregnant again too. Entertaining, but the premise has been worn thin -- it's sweet, but unnecessary.; The original \"Father of the Bride\" with Spencer Tracey is a really good comedy, the remake starring Steve Martin is a good sweet-natured, amiable enough comedy - and I don't really think a sequel was necessary at all. I mean the whole premise is basically the same - before George Banks (Martin) had to grasp the reality of his daughter being married, and now he has to come to grips with the fact that she's having a baby. A nice twist on this is that his wife (played by Diane Keaton) is ALSO pregnant, but nevertheless it's still (basically) the same as the first film in one form or another. Thankfully it doesn't seem like a total cash-in (like so many sequels of this sort do) because it has a certain charm (as did the first film) and is still remarkably entertaining, all considered. But you can tell it was made solely because of the success of the first film - even Martin Short is back with another extended cameo as Franz the wedding manager. Of course you may be wondering why he's involved with a pregnancy, since his business is weddings. Here's a hint: more $$$ for the studio. Martin is basically doing the same thing he did in the first film - the weary upper-class guy who feels overwhelmed by the state of things. Diane Keaton is still very sweet and likable as his wife. The rest of the cast (including Macaulay's little brother Kieran Culkin) range from OK to good. Martin Short, however, is yet again a stand-out and is very funny - he wasn't necessary for the plot but he is funny and a good addition to the movie regardless. Overall I'd say this is one of those sequels that didn't need to be made, but could have been a lot worse. It's sweet, it's got some good lite-comedy moments, and in general it's just an enjoyable family movie that isn't trying to be anything other than simple entertainment -- which it is. Touching even in its weak state.; Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, and kimberly Williams Paisley return in Father of the Bride Part 2. The film as a sequel was slightly disappointing, but on the whole, likeable. George and Nina Banks are in for the surprise of their lives when they find themselves middleaged and expecting their third child.  The timing is impeccable as Annie Banks-MAckenzie also realizes that she is expecting. Thus Steve MArtin embarks on a nine month journey that will consist of him building a new room for the baby, watching his daughter become a woman and overdosing on sleeping pills.  Honestly, the film made me laugh hysterically and i shed a few tears at the bittersweet ending. 3 and 1/2 stars out of five. Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video Funny Sequel; Geogre Banks is getting used to life without his precious daughter Anne. Now he is thinking about all the free time he will have when his son is out of the house.That`s when Anne announces that she is going to have a baby.Geogre is shocked but he becomes even more shocked when he finds out his wife is going to have baby as well.Now he has to deal Franck helping out with the two pregnant women.Can Geogre ever get a break? This is my second favorite movie.My first is Father of the bride part I.This is a good movie.See it it is a great sequel.It is almost as good as the first one. Steve Martin steals the screen. AWESOME!; This movie is great!  I think it's one of the best movies ever made!  I love both Father of the Bride I and II!  I think that it is cute how they have the mother and daughter pregnant at the same time!  I hope that they come out with a Father of the Bride Part III, that would be awesome! :-) This is my favorite movie; ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is my favorite movie.  I think it is funny, sweet, and truly touches the heart.  In the sequel to the previous, Father of the Bride, George Banks (Steve Martin) is finally getting over the fact that his beloved daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams)has gotten married.  But then she shocks him with the news that she is pregnant.  Everyone else is thrilled, but George is not.  He believes that he is too young to be a grandfather.  He tries to become young, but doesn't succeed.  Then, both he and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton) are shocked to find out that Nina is also pregnant.  George now thinks he is too old to be a father.  They have one other child other then Annie, Matty (Kieren Culkin.)  Through the chaotic turns of pregnancy, George learns to except the fact that his daughter has grown up and moved on, even though it is hard.  They also have to deal with Fronk (Martin Short,) the goofy wedding coordinator from the first movie, who is now designing the new baby's room.  They then discover that Annie has been given the opportunity to design a museaum in Boston, far away from their own, San Marino, California.  George now realizes that he will miss his daughter more then ever, but he learns to get along.  In the end, he enjoys being a grandfather to baby George, and a father again, to Megan, named after the doctor who delievered her.  In this funny and heartwarming sequel, everyone puts out fantastic performences once again.  Even though I very much enjoy Father of the Bride, I enjoy this much more. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. The Best Movie of All Time; let me tell you.. anyone who does not like the movie is just a little close minded.. i read comments that thought the movie was too unrealistic but thats what makes it so great! i mean look at other movies such as lord of the rings or star wars neither or them contain true reality.. this is why its a movie. Anyway, i loved Steve martin in this movie. he does a magnificent job of playing the character for an over protective dramatic father. he was the best actor. who could have played the part of Nina as well as Diane Keaton. she makes the part of the mom annoyingly overwhelming mother, which is exactly what the point of us as the audience to think of her. martin short is the best of all \"fra'nk's\". the way he seeks George banks's approval is perfect. and lastly Kimberly Williams is the gorgeous daughter we are all expecting her to be.. i watch this movie every night before bed and i can recite every word to this movie. because of father of the bride II i have dreamed to meet Steve martin.. \"hes my hero!!\" hopefully you fall in love with it too. and dream to be pregnant with your mother as did Annie banks. A Well-Done Sequel!; A sequel to immensely likable Father of the Bride, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is A Well-Done Sequel! Its enjoyable as well as emotional! 'Father of the Bride Part II' Synopsis: George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. 'Father of the Bride Part II' is worthy sequel of a wonderful prequel. The characters still appeal, the humor works &amp; the emotional moments are heartfelt as well. Nancy Meyers &amp; Charles Shyer's Screenplay is genuinely well-done. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography &amp; Editing are fair. Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains. On the whole, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is a satisfying sequel. A so so sequel; 'Father of the bride' was a good film and probably didn't need a sequel. But this is Hollywood, everything needs a sequel. While it is clear that a lot of effort has gone into making this sequel work, the central idea stretches credibility and every idea the writer had seems to have been thrown at the wall in a desperate attempt to get laughs. There are moments that remind you of the heart and humour that the preceding film had, but it's a load of nothing really. I went into this film dubious about how good it could be, and I didn't finish watching it any more convinced that the original needed a sequel. daughter gets married; In the sequel to Father of the Bride we have the daughter getting married and moving away from home, this presents a big dilemma to the father played of course by Steve Martin. Maybe not quite as funny as the first one,, or as good,, but definitely above average,, it's always a pleasure watching Steve Martin work at his craft. The movie is basically about how the family,, especially the parents deal with their young daughter growing up,, getting married, and eventually moving away from the nest.. the cameo from Eugene Levy is just wonderful,, as a real estate agent who is trying to sell the very home where our main character lives.. all in all a very family friendly movie,, that I would recommend. Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. Better than the first one!; I love Steve Martin, but I was disappointed by the first movie, so I wasn't expecting as much from this one.  But to my surprise, this one was even better! It's constantly funny, just like one should expect from Steve Martin; it's not preoccupied with corny emotion, like the first movie was. It's Steve Martin in his best performance since \"My Blue Heaven.\" Sometimes sequels can be surprisingly good.  This one is better.  It has all the comedic elements that were stagnant in the first movie.  It's everything the first movie should have been, and more! Father of the Bride Part II; The first film was the remake of the original version starring Spencer Tracy and Dame Elizabeth Taylor, and it became very popular, so naturally they felt like a sequel was needed to continue the story. Basically George Banks (Golden Globe nominated Steve Martin) is getting used to the fact that his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) has become the bride now wife and got married to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), and more surprisingly a mother when she reveals she is pregnant. With this revelation comes out George has a small midlife crisis, and he tries to recapture his youth, including dying his hair, but he does eventually settle somewhat and get used to the idea that he will be a grandfather. But then he is shocked to find out he will be a father again as well when his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) reveals that she is also pregnant, and it may appear that both her and Annie's baby will be born on the same day. With these things happening, and the house having leaks and termites there is the opportunity to change things by selling the house to Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy), but he changes his mind later. When George manages to get the house back, despite a higher price, he gets the help of camp wedding planner/coordinator, now interior designer, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) to make the baby rooms and get things ready for the arrival of children. There are a couple of false alarms from Annie where she thinks the baby is coming, but eventually it comes to the real thing, and they rush to hospital, and of course Nina goes in to labour as well. In the end George is very happy to be holding both his new baby son and his new baby granddaughter is his arms, before his daughter and her husband move away to their own new home. Also starring Kieran Culkin as Matty Banks, B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein, Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie and Jane Adams as Dr. Megan Eisenberg. I can see what the critics mean by giving it two out of five stars in certain places, it certainly isn't as funny as the original film, it concentrates more on the sentimental material, but that's not a bad thing for this comedy drama. Okay! Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. 5/10 \"Father 2\" : Born again.; Okay,now the sequel \"Father Of The Bride 2\",which was surprisingly better than expected. Like anyone who sees a sequel,you expect almost a carbon copy of the first. It does start similar to the first movie,with George sitting in a chair addressing us,the audience. It also does an unfortunate repeat of the fight between Annie &amp; Bryan,again like the first movie,I saw it coming. The baby shower party is not played big,like the first after wedding party but I laughed when actual storks carrying little bundles showed up. I was kind of \"iffy\" on the sub-plot of George selling the house,having to leave in ten days and then blowing a bundle to get it back again. I'm not questioning the probability (we know in reality that'd be impossible),I just found it kind of unnecessary. I did however like his dyed hair and new look,that was hilarious and he should have kept it until the end of the movie. Some may say the idea of a mother &amp; daughter being pregnant at the same time,is impossible. Yet,somehow it works here. It's not just the obvious next step for Annie but for George and his wife too,who thought having babies was way behind them. I love Steve Martin's warped expression when Bryan calls him a \"Grandfather\"! I liked that a woman having a baby in her 40's was taken very seriously,since it's a fact that women who have babies later in life have a more difficult time. It makes for a good piece of drama in a film that's otherwise a family comedy. The comedy is helped once again by the presence of Martin Short and I like that he becomes more involved with the family. Especially helping George out the front door on his back. This after giving him sleeping pills for rest. Once the babies are born and Bryan &amp; Annie head to Boston for a new life,the film gets a very touching ending with George and his new baby girl. 8 out of 10 for the expected repeat of ideas,otherwise a very well made sequel. (END) not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the 1951 movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the 1950 classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the 4 year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com Not bad...but could have been better; The first time I saw Father of the Bride 2 I really liked it.  I still enjoy watching some parts of it but I thought some realistic parts in the movie were not necessary.  First of all, the mother and daughter pregnant together.  This could happen but probably when the mother is not older than 40.  Nina had to be at least 47.  Is it likely that the mother would be pregnant at that age? I don't think so.  Secondly, I could not understand why George and Nina wanted the baby to have two last names.  Children always go by their father's last name and I thought Brian's father made a good observation when he said that George and Nina already had Matt to carry on the Banks name.  So why they thought the baby should have two last names is beyond me.  In conclusion, Father of the Bride 2 is still cute and fun to watch in some parts but I thought the first one was much better Some of Martin's best work!; First, this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2. If run back to back, they run like one beautiful story. This production is great from start to finish. Everything about it is wonderful, including the story, the acting performances and the direction. This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor. His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances. He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man. This movie is no exception. His performance is comedic, yet startlingly genuine. Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's. I love this movie. I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character; with how he feels, and what he's going through. This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum, and I love it. It's less about family, and more about life's curves; the every-day things that make us crazy, happy, sad, and ultimately stronger. It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think, consider, ponder the events which have led us to where we are now. Combined, they rate 8.6/10 from... the Fiend :. Good, so long as you don't try to think too much; It was a fun movie, but it had no particular substance. I mostly watched it because I'd seen the first one. And because it was free on my cable. Or at least, I wasn't paying only to see it. Now, I have done that before and been pleasantly surprised, but this just wasn't one of those movies. Most of what was in this movie has been done already in the first film, and then it was in a much better way. Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, I'm just glad that I got to watch it free. Sure, Steve Martin's always fun to watch, particularly when he's acting dopey for whatever reason, but that didn't make it a great film. Just mediocre. Still, it's fun for a laugh. Average comedy sequel; There's been better, and there's been worse. \"Father of the Bride Part II\" falls right in between when it comes to sequels of comedies. The plot was easily predictable and the movie didn't have as many Steve Martin funny moments as the original. There were some good moments that made me laugh though, most being scenes with Martin Short. It did seem like sort of a stretch, though that all of the sudden \"Frank\" was an interior designer as well as a wedding/baby shower coordinator. I guess they just needed a way to keep him in the movie longer. I was hoping for a lot more when I rented this. My advice: stick to the original. Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! Worthy second installment.; Mild SPOILERS are contained in the following comments. However, I believe everyone knows the story and how it turns out. The fun of the movie is seeing the actors, especially Martin. Steve Martin is back as George Banks, having just lost his daughter and basketball partner (Kimberly Williams as Annie ) to marriage, and now she is back home with her husband and a big announcement. She is pregnant. Of course everyone is happy, and the joy is doubled when Nina Banks (Diane Keaton as Annie's mom) finds out she is pregnant too. Poor George doesn't know if he can handle all this. After all, he is about to be a grandfather, he's not prepared to be a new father also. Martin Short is back as Franck Eggelhoffer, the unintelligible wedding planner. All ends well as both mom and daughter deliver their babies at the same time, in separate hospital rooms, so George has to go back and forth. The movie ends a few months later, and as Annie and her new baby are leaving, she gives dad a miniature basketball, a reminder to George that he can raise another basketball partner. Like Cliches?; ...That weren't even funny the first time? I've seen a lot of films with Steve Martin in them, and they all made me laugh.  Until this one. Part one is worth a look..it may make you laugh a couple of times (I think I laughed once).  But I recommend avoiding this one all together. not bad for a sequel; as sequels go,this is film isn't too bad.i didn't think ti was quite as good as the first one,but it's not a bad effort.i didn't find it as funny,and some of Steve Martin's histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me.really,this one doesn't quite have the same sincerity as the first.through much of this movie,i was all too aware i was watching a movie,whereas with firs tone,i was drawn in,and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting.having said that,there are some bright spots.for,one,this movie is just as touching as the first.and Eugene levy has a great cameo.and there is still some fun to be had.even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above,i still think Father of the Bride II is a 7/10 Not as good as the first, but still great fun.; In the sequel to the brilliant Father Of The Bride, Nina Banks and her daughter Annie are both pregnant and George Banks, being his usual nervous self has to learn to get used to the idea that he's going to be a father again AND a grandfather. The whole cast including, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams and Martin Short are all back here giving good performances. Even though Father Of The Bride Part II is not as good as the first Father Of The Bride, this is still a great movie which is enjoyable and fun all the way through and that's why I'm going to give this good sequel a 10/10.  Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. Good; This is well worth seeing. Everything goes perfectly. Ain't no such thing as too much Steve Martin, baby. Here Martin carries weak material, but it's a positive movie that shows the joy a new child brings. You will laugh, cry and cheer. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Some of the dialog is a bit lost on US audiences, but still some hilarious lines. The music is amazing throughout. Also the scenery is incredible. I saw the cast had a lot of great comedians, so I thought there would at least be a few laughs. Instead, I was surprised to see a very touching movie, absolutely great script. I give it 7 out of 10. What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... A really likable comedy.; I enjoyed this film. I found that it was easy to relate to Steve Martin's character George Banks as a parent. The relationship between him and his daughter Annie, played by Kimberly Williams, was an honest father daughter relationship. I recommend this one for parents in general and empty nesters in particular. The idea of a mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time is plausible and amusing. Fantastic; Both the first movie and this sequel are fantastic. I loved the first movie, so I thought I would give the second one a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised!! The acting from all the characters is amazing, from Steve Martin to Diane Keaton to Kimberly Williams-Paisley. 16 years after its release this movie is still a gem. When I'm feeling down or just need a go-to comedy for a night in, these two movies are the best. For those who say that a 40-something woman is too old to have a baby--that's just not true. Do your research. I bet more people have been in that situation than you think. Anyway, this is a feel-good movie for some great laughs and a few happy tears! I really found this film quite annoying; My basic opinion of this movie is that it is a crappy American feel good comedy. It is simply about a man who is going through another mid-life crisis as his daughter, who was married in the first movie, has a baby in this one. The catch is that his wife is also pregnant and with the irony really dripping, both of them have their babies within minutes of each other. As such the kid's auntie is exactly the same age as him (it won't happen to me, though it is possible). When I watch this movie I think to myself, this guy really doesn't have problems. There are people out there that have much more serious problems than he does. He admits to having a beautiful wife who loves him, owns his own home (or did), has a great job and great kids - and he thinks he has problems. Maybe the whole comedy is in the fact that he is worrying about absolutely nothing, but seriously, when I watch this movie, I simply shake my head and think that the guy is a loser. I really don't think it is all that funny. In fact, the guy has much more serious problems. He seems to be spending an awful lot of money, and is going to find himself in a huge amount of debt, and he doesn't seem to ever be at work. My question is not only where he gets his money, but where he gets the collateral for all of the purchases he is making. He buys back his house for an extra $100,000 on top of what he sold it for, and really, how can he seriously afford it. Okay, it wasn't all that bad. As a movie is was made well, and I did chuckle a few times. But in reality, this guy is a serious loser because he has more than anybody could possibly ask for, and he is worried about growing old. Hell, we all grow old, but he has experience more than what a lot of us have already had. Instead of worrying about growing old, the twit should look back on his life and be thankful for the blessings that God has already given him as opposed to forgetting all of that and winging about his age. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a 10, i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Very Warm and Funny.; This movie is a very warm and funny family film. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the Sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny. The only thing I didn't like was Eugene Levy's character, I found that his part was just put there to extend the movie a bit. I also didn't like how they used him in the second one when he was clearly the one who auditioned to be the wedding singer in the first one. All in all this is a great family film where many will enjoy and watch together. I loved it, but one thing bothered me...; I enjoyed this movie: Diane Keaton is my favourite actress, Steve Martin always makes me laugh and Martin Short is great, but I felt really sorry for Keaton having to pretend to be pregnant. She didn't seem to be enjoying it and when the Banks were at the hospital, she actually looked rather bored, because whenever she spoke from the moment George protested about the doctor's name, she almost made it sound like she was in a maths lesson. Apart from that, it was great! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching Martin, Keaton or Short in a movie or who likes to laugh. 9/10 because of the little problem, but it was great. I loved it. Not exactly the most innovative of films, but still great fun!; This is an excellent, funny, warming film. Although a lot of the \"same kind of thing\" was done in the first movie, it's still entertaining. Steve Martin's character was good, although at times his behaviour is quite pathetic and Martin Short is again entertaining. (Particularly his pronunciation of the word 'pregnant).' Although it's highly predictable and not the most intellectually stimulating of films it is still well worth watching and the vast majority of people would enjoy this film. And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW2, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. As I understand it, there were accusations of anti-Arab stereotyping?; \"Father of the Bride II\" may seem to some people like a lesser Steve Martin movie, with him as the patriarch from the previous movie now having to deal with his daughter's and wife's pregnancies. Unpretentiously silly. But one interesting thing is that apparently, some Arab groups claimed that the movie was making anti-Arab stereotypes, as a Middle Eastern man buys their house with plans to demolish it. I wouldn't have interpreted that as anti-Arab; I mean, it's not like they're portraying him as a terrorist. Oh well, life goes on. The movie's a nice, goofy way to pass time. I really liked the scene where they bring Steve Martin into the hospital (that would've sure been an embarrassment!). Also starring Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, B.D. Wong and Eugene Levy. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the 1951 sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of 50. This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Heartwarming &amp; Hilarious; Steve Martin does it again in this touching and funny sequel to 1991's Father Of The Bride the rest of the cast returns in a new story dealing with the joys of parenthood. I loved Father Of The Bride II not only because it was funny, mostly it was due to the comic antics of a man dealing with two pregnancies at once. He's a great comedian as well as an on screen father, my favorite scene is when both babies arrive at the same time. A year has passed since George Banks (Martin) watched his only daughter Annie (Williams) get married and has accepted her transformation from daughter to wife. She comes home with her husband Brian (Newbern) to announce the wonderful news to her parents, brother Matty (Culkin) and in-laws that she's pregnant. Everyone is thrilled and excited except for George who thinks he's too young to be a grandpa, from then on he tries to act young by dying his hair and exercising. But things are about to get a little crazy when his loving wife Nina (Keaton)discovers she's pregnant too now George must deal with the impending arrival of both his grandchild and his own child. Thrown into the chaos is Franck Eggelhoffer (Short) the wedding coordinator who helps to design a room for the new addition to the Banks family. This movie is not only sweet but it's charming entertainment for fans of all ages. Not bad, but inferior to the first; I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the first movie. It was not without sentiment and it was hardly original, but it was still beautifully filmed, well acted, charming and funny. This sequel is not as good as the first I agree, but I still quite enjoyed it. The story is predictable, and there are some so-so parts in the script. Eugene Levy, who I do like by the way, is okay here but his character felt somewhat unnecessary and felt like he was there as an additional character and to give the film a longer length. And I also would have liked to have seen more of Kimberley Williams, she is so beautiful and quite a good actress, but I actually do agree that a little too much time is spent between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. However, it is beautifully filmed, has a nice soundtrack, decent pacing and good direction. And the acting is fine too, Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are still very likable, and while as I've said I would have liked to have seen more of her Kimberley Williams was lovely. And I loved Martin Short here too, he was one of the main merits of the first film, so to see him in his wonderfully fluffy turn again was a very nice surprise. Overall, not bad at all, could have been better, but I liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Pretty much just a rehash of the first; As this movie started, it reminded me a lot of the first. Various scenes were reenacted, only a little wackier, sort of like it was trying to be a shade more funny than the first; I guess that is the usual stuff for this type of sequels, but I think it failed at that. Apart from that, the movie pretty much succeeds in being a good sequel to the first. The story is also somewhat reminiscent of the first one. All the same actors return as well, and they are pretty much the same, just a shade more wacky. The story is also told by Steve Martins character, George Banks, like in the first. Pretty much everything in the movie is a takeoff of the first; this doesn't make it bad though, if you liked the first, liked the characters, you'll want to see this too, if nothing else, to see the characters again. It is about as funny and as sentimental as the first was, and as enjoyable. Fans of the first one, or of Steve Martin will most likely enjoy at least some part of it, as this is the typical for both the first movie and Steve Martin. 7/10 Father of the Bride Part II; The 1991 Steve Martin comedy proved out to be popular enough to earn a sequel, much like the original Father of the Bride of 1950. All of the main cast of the first film returns in a story where the eponymous father George Banks (Martin) has gotten over the stressful wedding of his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) and her fiancé Bryan (George Newbern). However, when she breaks the big news about her pregnancy to the family, the grandpa-to-be becomes anxious about getting older and starts proving his youthfulness in various ways, such as selling the family's beloved house to a greedy real estate developer Habib (Eugene Levy). Life has more in store for George and his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) though, as it soon turns out that Annie's is not the only pregnancy in the family. Again, the humour is best when it relies on Steve Martin's comical talent and charisma instead of craziness and exaggeration. Unfortunately, adhering to the rule of always making sequels bigger and louder, the writers have given more screen time to the unbelievably annoying wedding planner Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) whose noisy and flamboyant scenes are certainly the weakest parts of the whole movie. The fussy bumbling caused by the impending childbirths at the end is also rather annoying and unimaginative. I think the movie works best during the more subtle scenes, such as Martin making uncomfortable faces while hiding his nervousness or arguing about the baby's surname with the overjoyed family during a dinner. Besides the run-of-the-mill jokes, the movie also shamelessly wallows in impenetrable sentimentalism of the newborns' adorability. Especially the music is so unbelievably schmaltzy that it was really getting on my nerves while watching; can't the filmmakers just trust their material's appeal without burying it under a sweety-tweety sugar mountain? Nevertheless, despite the predictability of the plot and the not-so-hilarious jokes, George Banks is a very likable character and Steve Martin is at home in the role, so those who enjoyed the first movie will probably like this one too  the basic building blocks of the story have not been changed at all. One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. My comments are going to be very positive.; Hi! I think that Father of the Bride Part 2 was a great film and very hilarious. I think that the mother and daughter could have been pregnant at the same time!  It was a great movie and I recommend it to all people who want a warm-your-heart comedy! It's a great film! Thanks! Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. Loved it!!; I thought the sequel to the first Father of the Bride just showed what a great chemistry Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, George Newbern, and Kieran Culkin, along with all the other supporting actors have together. I would actually love to see a Father of the Bride Part III and I usually hate more and more sequels. I really do enjoy this sequel and I think it is better than the first one. I would reccommend any and everyone seeing this movie (but not without seeing the first one). like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $15k bonus to move out in 10 days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $100k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. Good, but first one was better; This film is good but you have to suspend disbelief quite a few times. All the performances are fine, with Steve Martin a scream again, and Diane Keaton glowing from start to finish (she has a lot more to do here than in FOTB1). The best scenes are: George trying to get buff in the gym, asking which famous men he's younger than, pointing to his wedding ring at the lady in the car next to him, and seeing all the misbehaving children out the window in his car while his wife sees all the happy kids and their parents out her window. And of course, when George holds his child and grandchild outside the delivery room. My favorite line: \"Now going to the movies will be economical: one child, two seniors, thanks!\" good, but a mistake; this movie rocks. but there is one thing weird. okay, so in the beginning Annie says, \"i have lived here since i was 5!\" and then later right when they are selling the house and playing basketball Annie and George(her dad) and her dad says \"i remember the first time we played out here, you were 4.\" wait...so was she 4 or 5 when they moved in??????????? other than that this movie makes me laugh, cry(because i laugh so much), and..........uh.....what was that other thing people say when they say that? i don't really remember. i just love how Steve martin always is so cheap. I am forced to say more so i will say i love that this movie is always on HBO! And i realized something, Steve martin has had white hair like forever! Not as good as the first, but good family fun; This movie is as thin as you can get. Its' emotions are easily played. There are no surprises. It is very predictable. And I say...so what? What is wrong with that? This is an American Dream movie. Everything goes perfectly and everyone is as happy as can be. Why should it be a complicated character study? It deals with the birth of babies. There's no complex feelings that need to be dealt with in this situation. A life is being created. A family is being blessed. A baby's birth is a time for love and hope. This movie has both in spades. It's a very positive movie that shows the joy a new baby brings. Every parent-to-be should watch it. A child's birth is an emotional event with no equal. This movie knows it and milks it for all its' worth. My only complaint is it should have been called Parents of the Bride. Way too much time is spent with the relationship between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. There should have been more attention paid to Kimberly Williams. Not only were the scenes between her and Martin the best scenes in this and the original, but Kimberly Williams is the most beautiful actress to come out of Hollywood in many years. Forget all the blond, silicone filled, bimbos that every teenage boy raves about. Ms. Williams is a natural beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late '40's)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now...</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Simply Brilliant; It doesn't matter whether you're young or old, this is a great movie. Woody is Andy's favourite toy and like all the other toys lives with the fear of being discarded when new toys arrive. He's therefore very worried when Buzz Lightyear arrives. Buzz is an instant hit with Andy and Woody is not very happy. To make matters worse Buzz doesn't think he is a toy and believes he is on a mission. The story really gets going when woody inadvertantly knocks buzz out of the house and the two of them end up with evil Syd who tortures toys. There's lots of adult humour meaning that the parents will find this as funny as the kids. The real winning combination of Toy Story is the characterisation and the empathy you can feel for the animated leads. Although they're not real this is one of the best buddy movies ever made. My personal favourite character is Mr Potato Head because of the dry humour. A classic 10/10 toy story; The original and the best. Woody and the gang have only fun and games until Buzz shows up and steals Woody's thunder. Woody is a pull-string cowboy and the leader of a group of toys belonging to a boy named Andy Davis. With his family moving away one week before his birthday, Andy is given a week-early party to spend with his friends, while the toys stage a reconnaissance mission to discover Andy's new presents. Andy receives a space ranger Buzz Lightyear action figure, whose impressive features see him replacing Woody as Andy's favorite toy. Woody is resentful, especially as Buzz also gets attention from the other toys. However, Buzz believes himself to be a real space ranger on a mission to return to his home planet, as Woody fails to convince him he is a toy. Not one of my favorites; After hearing about the success of the toy story series, a rented a DVD which had a collection of Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc. I loved Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2 but I did not enjoy Toy Story 1 even that much. These were the points that I didn't like in the movie: 1) In the starting, when Andy is shown playing with the toys, he starts to get a bit annoying after he keeps on playing with it. His love for the toys throughout the film bugged me after a while. But I did not find this too boring as even my cousin is a great fan of Spiderman and keeps buying and playing with the toys. 2) The animation looked a bit faded in the movie. But I didn't pay much attention towards it giving an excuse that it was made in 1995 and compared to Finding Nemo and the other new movies, its animation would be a bit duller. 3) Sorry Tom Hanks, but I found your character quite annoying in the film as you kept screaming like a mad character and I did not like you that much. 4) Woody's girlfriend in the movie had a terrible voice. I expected a cute shepherdess's voice to be more cute and sweet rather that being a bit rough and sounding like the second woman in a love story. 5) Mr.Potato head and the other characters, except for the spring dog, really annoyed me when they were reluctant to listen to Woody. I mean, why couldn't they just wait and understand him. 6) The bad boy removed some parts of his toys to make them look terrible. But towards the end, when the toys help Woody and Buzz, Woody thanks them and just leaves. Why didn't he tell the toys to leave that stupid place and run away with them? They should have included these characters in the second film, at least. 7) Toys had lives in the movie. So why did they not just start living alive with the humans? Why do they fall still when their masters came? They could play alive with them. The movie had some good points too. Here are some of them: 1) Tim Allen has done a fantastic voicing as Buzz, and I liked Buzz in the movie as he was shown brave, his voicing was done well and he didn't bore me at all. 2) The dog who supported Woody was cute and I liked him, just, I liked him, in the movie. 3) The movie was different from other movies, as here, toys were shown as the protagonists. 4) The dinosaur was funny and his character uplifted the film. Overall, I don't think it deserves to be in the top 250 movies. But its the people's choice and if they wish that it would be in the top 250, then I can do nothing but give my review on the film. One of the all time greats - but you know that already.; The toys of a small boy have their cosy lives thrown into disarray with the arrival of a new space toy, and the family's imminent move to another home... The first real mainsteam adult-friendly computer animated film. Actually the first real computer-animated film. Toy Story took a cutesy premise and made it believable with a very good storyline, excellent voice acting and amazing design, especially for the time even though this holds up exceptionally well now. More important than this is the longevity of the characters, you can have the prettiest backdrop and brightest colours going but if a kid doesn't like the characters in the thing it isn't going far. Go to a birthday party for any kid under 10 and you'll likely see a Buzz Lightyear or Woody the cowboy. More important this film can be watched and rewatched by anyone from 3 to 43 and there will be something to enjoy, again and again. As a side-note: My videoshop password was Woody for about 5 years thanks to this movie. What you hope kids will learn: Be good to your toys. What they'll take away: Space toys are cool. And Cowboy toys are cool. And Dog toys are cool. And I need one of those Dinosaur toys. Oh, oh, oh and a Mr Potato Head... And a Piggy! And... If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com \"Toy Story\" - The best computer animated film for good reason; As a child, have you ever wondered at one point in your life what might happen in your room full of toys while you weren't in it? In Disney- Pixar's landmark 1995 computer animated feature \"Toy Story\", we get that possible answer as the film is about toys that come to life while the owner is out of their room. In case you don't know why \"Toy Story\" is an important American film and why it's one of only two animated films to make the AFI's list of the 100 greatest films of all time, allow me to fill you in. It was the first full-length computer animated feature ever made and arguably the best in my opinion. \"Toy Story\" was so popular that it was responsible for initiating Pixar's big streak of success with other computer animated features such as \"Up\" (2009), \"WALL-E\" (2008), and \"The Incredibles\" (2004). In \"Toy Story\", a group of toys that belong to a young kid named Andy come to life while he's out of the room. They're all led by Andy's favorite toy, a cowboy doll named Woody (Tom Hanks). They've just learned that Andy and his family will be moving away to another neighborhood. Not only that, but his birthday party is being celebrated earlier than expected, which means new toys will be joining them for sure, much to the horror of the other toys. They're afraid that the new toys will be so cool that Andy will no longer want to play with them anymore. Despite this, Woody assures the other toys that everything will be alright and no one will be forgotten. That is until he discovers Andy's newest toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a space ranger action figure who thinks he's the real space ranger that he's based on. Woody becomes so jealous over how cool a toy he is that he tries to do whatever he can to become Andy's favorite toy again. When one of his attempts at getting noticed by Andy accidentally goes too far (meaning Buzz gets transported out of the house), Woody tries to rescue him and re-earn the trust of his fellow toys. But through a series of circumstances, Woody gets lost right alongside Buzz and they are accidentally found by Andy's next door neighbor, Sid. This is a problem for both of these toys since Sid enjoys torturing and destroying toys. So now Woody and Buzz must get over their differences and work together to get out of Sid's house and back to Andy before he moves. What we have here story wise is your typical buddy comedy in animated form, but it's done right. I'm not saying it just because it's told through a new form of animation, but because the film handles this type of story in an imaginative way. The basic plot seems to play out naturally and comes off as if Pixar was inventing this type of plot for the first time. There are no plot devices that are forced to the point where it's painfully obvious. Everything on screen works within the fabric of the story. The comedic bits, along with being humorous, are very well handled and are necessary contributions to the plot. I loved how in one scene when Woody talks to the toys in Andy's room from Sid's house, the other toys think that Woody murdered Buzz by the end of the scene. That scene and similar scenes were very funny and well done. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are irreplaceable as Woody and Buzz, respectively, since they bring so much to the chemistry and dialogue between each other to the point where it's impossible to top them. They do a great enough job with what they bring into each of their roles that you couldn't picture hearing any other actors play these two characters. The same can also be said for the supporting cast as well, particularly Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn as Rex. The actors do a convincing job at bringing each of their characters to life and putting enough personality into them that they help enhance the story further as good acting should be doing. The way Pixar handles its characters in this movie is also worth noting. For example, even though Sid is having fun destroying toys and is considered evil by the toys, they don't necessarily make him the main villain. In other words, the characters created here aren't exactly clear cut heroes and villains, but they're simply individuals with different personalities. Woody isn't a bad guy because he technically gets Buzz and himself into trouble, he's simply afraid of being forgotten by Andy. That aspect about Woody makes us relate to him even more since we do learn from the mistakes that Woody makes over this misunderstanding. Buzz Lightyear makes for an enjoyable fish-out- of-water type character in that he strongly believes he's the real Buzz Lightyear to the point that being told that he's actually a toy would be nonsense in his mind. Pixar truly cared a great deal about its story and characters here. As you can tell, \"Toy Story\" is more than an innovative American film with its groundbreaking animation or even an entertaining family film. It's a film about characters that I'm sure most of us can relate to or identify with. It's a film for everybody to cherish for different reasons whether it be the animation, the humor, the story or the characters. I'll argue that it's still the finest film Pixar's produced yet. In a pinch, \"Toy Story\" is a film you should definitely check out if you haven't already. one of if not the best animated films ever; Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen. The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer. The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen. The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year) respecting everything around you and never being to greedy or needy. Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come up with. This is a film, that not only can the kids enjoy but also the adults too. Great fun, a film that's not just for kids; I wasn't too sure about this film before I watched it. The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story. The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up  something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space! Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home. Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is 6 years old, but I've only just seen it!). The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others  such as Mr. Potato Head  are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep  who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries! The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back. Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible. The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films  particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations. All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again. And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them? Well, now we know why! A fantastic family film.; The plot:A wooden cowboy doll called Woody is a young boy's favourite toy, yet when his owner gets a space toy of an astronaut called Buzz Lightyear, Woody has been left out of his owner's daily live. Woody finds out that Buzz Lightyear thinks that he really is a space ranger.     Both toys are now fighting each other while being kidnaped by the next door nieghbour that hates toys and must work together to get back to their owner before they are destroyed. The view:A wonderful enchanting and nicely funny story about rivally between two toys that are animated very well, with the fact of the movie being the first that was computer animated, this movie is really for everyone that enjoys watching a film that the whole family will delight in. Great fun. **** I never really thought this was the best movie...; Toy Story is a good movie. It has good characters and a decent story. But is it really worth the hype? Yes, it's the first fully computer animated movie ever made and that's very impressive. For that reason alone, it will stand out in history. But I certainly never really thought it was the brilliant classic everyone else thought it was. Its animation is great but the story suffers from major pacing issues. There are entire moments of the movie right in the middle that bore me every time and don't stop boring me until I get to the film's climax, when it picks up again. A lot of trimming should have been done in the middle. Toy Story is good but its sequels are a lot better. So is it bad? No. But it's not brilliant. If this were 2-D, I doubt it would receive this high praise. One of the greatest animated movies ever created!; I don't want to be biast, but Toy Story is one of the greatest animated movies ever created. I first watched this movie at about 2-4 years old, and I loved this movie. The storyline is excellently written, and always gets me laughing! The animation in this movie is incredible! As a computer animated film it was well ahead of its era (at least I think). Also, it was the first feature length film that was fully animated, and to this day is one of the best. With the success of this film it was no wonder they made a sequel, one that i enjoyed a lot! Also, I have heard that Pixar have announced Toy Story 3, and it will be a movie I will definitely see! They Don't Call it \"Playing\" for Nothing.; The opening scene says it all. Film-making begins in early childhood, as children use their toys to create little scenes (or movies if you will). The word \"play\" when used to describe such activity indeed derived from the movies of another era, plays. Or perhaps the other way around. Either way, the point of this film is to show that creating a film and playing with toys are virtually the same thing. So the film is basically about itself. A play about playing. This is exactly the type of multi-layered construction that I believe subconsciously challenges and nurtures our kids' minds. Teaching a child (or adult!) to think on more than one level at a time is simply a gift. It should also be applauded that it's all substance and no fluff. Other animation teams have inundated their films with meaningless pop culture gags, camp, and nostalgic irony. Not to mention an abundance of toilet humor. Music by the great Randy Newman instead of the Village People. None of the mindless pandering to adults here, either, yet we are included in the fun by being subtly reminded of our own play days. Barrel of Monkeys. Potato Heads. In fact there is a strong undercurrent theme here as the classic cowboy toy is threatened by the flashy new space man who is obviously being pushed on kids via a relentless marketing campaign. We 30-somethings must root for Woody. It's Wal-mart vs. our favorite mom-n-pop corner store. These Pixar guys are brilliant, and I believe they will be revered someday as perhaps the most important influence in all of filmdom during the turn of this century's period. There is no more sure thing than a Pixar offering. Always compelling, engaging, intelligent and abstract. And this one is the best. Perfect film; Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only concern is easy when you can replace the new birthday and Christmas toys already there. Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, such a birthday, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new toy buzz lightyear. Competition buzz on the edge of the bed to hide, but accidentally pushes him out the window boil runs Woody, and Woody and buzz find a few other expulsion leaves them with no choice but to return her home. But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence. Typically, animation, Intelligence, humor and children's humor, the same mixture (Ice Age, monsters Inc, Bugs life, toy story is being used since it's easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out given how. I just watched it again and new twists on the formula than a little comes out. Each one is clearer and there seems to be more references in the background etc. However, it is still very funny and deserve credit for being the first of a successful formula. The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement. To the shores really what the main story is fun, but in terms of character development. When confronted with the truth of his status as a toy and nothing more against him, the conflict between buzz and Woody cartoon character, this is taken deeper,,, buzz the turmoil is very real. Two powerful support customers, despite the players a real depth. In fact, more rows, but may not have the funniest lines. 'Adult' Intelligence most of the potato head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky Dog. Funny and very used. In fact, the majority of the humor will go over kids heads, and the plot on the right. Looking back, this movie really must have helped sales so much in the movie toy companies on a sarcastic edge I feel. The marketing department behind this film it's not that hard to see standing rubbing his hands. However, the actual product quickly I forgot about this great fun. The voice work is excellent and the characters the players match. Allen woody and buzz for the B-type as he has a voice Hanks movie is good. His usual Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (), reckless, and all other support roles for adults turns out to be really good and probably the favorite characters. In general, this (if not more) as a classic film that will appeal to children as adults. A good plot and a very sharp short command already make time fly by. The only downside to want to go out and buy the damn things children! Best Disney ever; Finally a Disney movie which isn't moralistic but just fun to watch. Also it doesn't have the boring \"sing-along-songs\" so this movie is also a perfect movie for anybody about 10 years and (much) older. I really liked the computer-generated graphics because the characters moved very smoothly, something which can't be done the original way. More of these masterpieces in the future please and I will really like Disney at last, but dont't make it to moralistic and musical. That this movie is above all the other Disney -movies in the IMDB top 250 is proof of that. A wonderful family movie!; What a wonderful movie for the whole family to enjoy!  I can hardly wait for Toy Story 2 to come out! Great As The Other One!; This Toy Story is as great as the second one! I saw the second one first and it was really cool! Best Pixar movie to date!; Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (\"I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout\"). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox. If it wasn't for Toy Story coming together so well, computer animation would have taken a step backwards.; 9.4 For years, Disney reigned as the superior animation studio. Although there were others creating animated feature length films, Disney has always been a household name, known for their experience and ability to create an emotional and entertaining experience out of hand-drawn images, and original, composed music. In 1995, Pixar Animation Studios released Toy Story. While it wasn't the first time that we've seen CGI, or Computer Generated Imagery, it was the first fully CGI film. What a disaster this film could have been. And thank God that it wasn't. If it was, then it would have done more damage to CGI animation than otherwise. The film was distributed by Disney, but created by Pixar. It had no musicals. No frames were hand drawn, everything was done by computer. It had a lot to live up to. Sticking the Disney name on the film meant that audiences expected not a single drop of mediocrity out of it. Thankfully, as we all know, Toy Story was a success. The animation in the film isn't the augmented reality kind. CGI effects aren't added to real life shots, everything is animated. This gives the film some room to breathe. The lighting, surfaces and other effects all look good, in their own context. It would have been a huge step backwards for computer animation if Toy Story didn't come together so well, and successfully put up that fourth wall. But besides the animation, what brings to film to life is the voice- acting, story, and presentation. It's a story about toys who are conscious and self-aware. However, they all follow a strict code, where they do not allow humans to know of their life and intelligence. It's not an epic tale. Two toys are lost and have to get back home. But what carries the film are the characters. Every toy has a distinct personality, and the voice actors are great in their roles. This is one of the strong points in Toy Story. The film's presentation is great, too. It went totally contradictory of what Disney means to people. There are no musicals, but the music, although used sparingly, has a great effect nonetheless. The direction is of the more typical Hollywood style, and different from the typical Disney movie. It is entertaining to exist in the toys' world, and when they venture off a couple of blocks, you feel like you have traveled a long distance. Toy Story could have been such a disaster. If it wasn't for everything coming together so well, especially the animation, characters and voice acting, computer animation would have taken a step backwards. Its greatest strength are the toys. They are amongst the better characters in film. Toy Story not only proved that animated films can be done in a different formula than the already great Disney one, but that computer animation was here to stay. It was a pleasure to the eyes, and a pleasure to the Andy inside all of us. The cartoon that started it all.; I am not a kid but a kid at heart. Toy Story is one of the best animated movies around. This is the most creative movie for kids and adults. Toy Story 2 is better story than the first one, but equally imaginative in computer graphics. Tears....; Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library. The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in 1937 lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Awesome; A very sweet and fun movie. TOY STORY has great computer animation. A simple yet well told story is also added as well. The voice overs are top notch and everyone gets a fair share in this movie. PIXAR has done a good job placing itself on the map. Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle. Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel. A good rent. Classic Animation!!; Toy Story was the first fully animated movie that released in 1995. Starring Tom Hanks as Woody who brings life to the cowboy pull- string doll. Buzz Lightyear, played by Tim Allen brought the right attitude for the newest addition to Andy's (John Morris) toy collection. The story takes us back to the day where we played with toys and used our imaginations to create our own stories. When Andy would leave the room the toys would come to life. A week before Andy's birthday, with his family moving, he is given a party to spend with friends before they leave. The toys plot a way to discover Andy's new presents. After the party the other toys discovered Buzz is one of the presents Andy's receives before he leaves. The main theme of the story to me is \"friendship.\" It's a great story relaying the message to be kind to everyone because you never really know when you might need them and your enemy could be your best friend in the end. After all, \"You've got a friend in me.\" Woody doesn't want to lose top spot as favorite toy so he plots to get rid of Buzz. He starts with a master plan that leaves the both of them in a situation to help each other to get home. The rich colors and 3D animation gives the movie a more realistic feeling as if it were drawn. It is the lighting, modeling, computer graphics and animations are what bring this movie to life. The shading of certain objects, cracks or spills could be the difference between a human look or manufactured. The lighting had to be hard to create the film. They had some dramatic moody lights in Sid's room, flashlight stuff, daylight, bright sun for all sorts of different kinds of environments. When they add light it gives more a visual interest for viewers and hide some flaw in animation. Andy's room gives a sense of a happy, friendly and safe place because the brightness in the room gives that affect. This is an overall great film introducing a new way of animations! A Toy in the making of another and more toys; Excellent voice match to character in movie. Could have more art and less same images repeat. Pixar is now faster than ever; 1995 a slower speed for animated film. Will watch again, but not over and over again, consecutively. Liked it on Facebook, happy go lucky and not afraid to be bold. Don't understand the likes and dislikes but willing to accept all criticism. My own personal review may be liked or may be disliked. The clearness and accurate manner for beautiful taste in dual role models for example Sid the evil kid whom abuses toys and Andy the kid who doesn't like to play rough. However, Sid's sister is quite an opposite to Sid as well; she being a girl and has a love for tea parties with her closest doll Friends. The jokes and laughter in \"Toy Story\" is what made this turn of a century animated film a door-buster into the the first \"digital\" animated films in history. Of course, one does grow old and the story is great passed on to your children in just about any house hold! Toy Story; The story is about toys. The boy who named Andy has toys and enjoys playing with them. To be surprised, their toys can talk and act freely. Nobody of human know the fact. Woody who is Andy's cowboy toy spends a good time, however, Andy's new toy appear for Woddy. The toy's name is Buzz Lightyear. Woody and Buzz fight all the time and loses sight of their family and toys. They tries a lot of ways to meet their family and toys. The film is a long film by Pixar Animation Studious. The genre of the movie is animation, comedy and fantasy. It has dialogue and colors. It has sound effect and it is good to use the way of music. I like the scene that Woody and Buzz success in getting into a car that Andy rides. The film can be enjoyed by only children but also adults. You've got a friend in me; \"Reach for the sky\"! The opening statement of Woody (Hanks) a toy cowboy during a boys playtime. A statement that proves to be ironic when he later looks up at a toy from space, Buzz Lightyear (Allen). Woody's owner is growing older and Woody struggles to accept the change as Buzz becomes Andy's new favourite toy. Leading from the once strong leader into a bout of jealousy and even malice as he tries to take Buzz out of the picture. Woody is then separated from Andy via a fight with Buzz and has to find a way home. Further change occurs as Woody is forced to align with Buzz to escape the toy antagonist Sid. It takes 3/4 of the movie for Woody to finally change his ways, and work with Buzz for the final great escape. Woody's journey from leader to outcast to redemption is intriguing to watch unfold. His final monologue with Sid was beautifully written as the toy out wits the boy. The whole irony of his story is that a child's mind is fleeting and 10 minutes of playing with Buzz and Woody would have been in the game again. For me it is Buzz that follows the greater path of change. Noble and confident throughout mostly due to being under the illusion he is an actual space ranger. Kudos to the writer who decided to take a toy from this world and make him believe he is real! Simple but incredibly compelling. Buzz's final realisation that he is a toy is arm breaking for him but heartbreaking for us. For a family movie Buzz's breakdown is surprising and well delivered and the journey back to being he hero has Buzz literally \"Reaching for the sky\". With us the viewers figuratively as we are up there with them cheering the final events. Woody and Buzz's journey home is supported by a cast of toys, each with a filled out personality. Loyal Slinky being one of my favourites, always reluctant to turn on his buddy Woody like the others. It's the direction of John Lasseter that puts us into this world. When Woody shouts \"You are a toy\". It's John speaking to us. From the beginning the camera is at ground level. We are not supposed to be a child watching his toys come to life but an actual toy, low level shots panning up throughout give a feel to the vastness of a toys world. We are right there through each playtime, adventure, triumph and failure and by the end Buzz may be flying but we are falling for these toys, in style. The story and characters are a success but the triumph is the medium in which the story is told. Through 3d animation, never before seen feature length. The Pixar animators made a bedroom and a pizza planet truly realistic. They brought toys to life in movement and texture. But most astonishing of all, they made us care for a bunch of 3d shapes put together through countless hours of rendering in a computer. The result is a metaphor for change, not just in the story itself and it's characters but in the medium it is told. The great change from 2d to 3d animation which is now common place for feature animation. This movie is a game changer for cinema and animation alike. Walt Disney and co did it in 1938. 54 years later John Lasseter and co did it again. The possibilities for 3d animation in film are Infinite, and Beyond...? this movie is awesome!the humor never bores!; i remember when this movie came out in 1995. i was seven at the time. i have loved it since day 1. actors such as tom hanks and tim allen bring sparkle to the show. they are both hillarious as woody and buzz. this movie is directed at both kids and adults. the humor never goes flat and it is never cheesy or corny. if you are a fan of tom hanks and tim allen or you just want a good laugh, than you shoud definitely watch this movie. you will not regret it. ********** out of **********. In my top 25; Although i like to think the 3rd is the best, everyone should respect this film, the first feature film to be animated, and still holds up as one of the best! And not to mention being in the top 250, thats a accomplishment! this film will forever stay with me as a Nostalgic relic, i only hope that newer generations will remember this film as i do. I still like to think of this as my favorite film of all time, if anyone was to ask me, usually because i can't think of one i'd rather be proud of saying i love it so much, or maybe i'm a total hipster? This film for me is a 8/10, not as perfect as the 3rd, but good enough for any Pixar fan. An Entertaining Accomplishment; This movie is one of the real achievements of the modern age, and a real measure of how good is the fact that you quickly forget your amazement at the computer animation and just get the story. We signed up to buy it the first day they had pre-orders and have enjoyed it since - and we didn't have kids then! A rare combination of many things that can be enjoyed by everyone.  I can't believe anyone would rate it less than a 9! A MUST HAVE! It's a Happy Movie! Ya there's spoilers; I put this computer animated movie just on the cusp of being great. You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time...8.7/10 This DVD is part of the Toy Story 2 Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages. Quality animation always looks good on the big screen and this looks wonderful. This is a Buy and Hold to flesh out your collection to include 'Happy Movies' as my daughter puts it. The DVD is a solid 9/10 Toy Story; A wonderfully sculpted piece of filmmaking. It brings us into a new age and may this new age have films that are just as delightfully witty as this pleasing film for all ages. The laughs are constant, there's great creativity at work, from the artists and the numerous talents who lend their voices. Hanks, Allen, Rickles and Ermey stand out in their performances. An unmissable film; From our first sight of Woody until his happy face disappears off of the screen the makers of this film keep audiences worldwide glued to the screen with eager anticipation. The films unlikely scenario where talking toys battle to save a fellow toys life is amazingly gripping and a \"must see\" which will keep the whole family (yes even the teenageers) amused. The more mature audience will recognise the \"spoofy\"side to the movie. This is most noticeable when plastic soldiers (who mimic the actors in \"Who saves wins\") jump off  bannisters with miniature parachutes and talk to each through baby monitering systems.!!! In conclusion, TOY STORY is one of the most thought out films in the industry as props and scenerycan not just be found lying around and everything had to be individually designed, crafted and computerised The Best Animated Movie of All Time; 1995's Toy Story is a work of pure imagination. It covers topics of fantasy, friendship and jealousy. It also contains relatable characters which shines out compared to other animated films. The actors were perfectly cast (Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz - the list goes on...) and the intricate plot can be compared to some of the best movies ever. I think everyone in the world has seen Toy Story, but if you haven't, it's a must see. Its by far superior to its two sequels, but they are decent. Not only is it a great film, it is historically significant, as it was the first fully 3D animated film. You HAVE TO SEE THIS... J My favorite film as a kid and remains a classic today; As a kid, I remember watching the first two Toy Story films frequently and collecting all the characters from the movie. I found out that it was the very first computer-animated film about two years ago and assumed that's why the movie is still so popular. Woody and Buzz are what made the film what it was then and today and were my favorite characters. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is where Woody and Buzz are launched in the air from the rocket and Buzz frees himself to fly into Andy's toy box. The film remains a classic and always will be to me. I also cannot wait for the third movie to come out June 18, 2010 because I'll be the first in line. A resounding success; Pixar knocks it out of the park with its first feature film, about friendship, jealousy and the capriciousness of privileged white kids in a society of disposability. A clever, sharp and imaginative screenplay expertly voiced by a stellar cast (I would give this 5/10 just for casting Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head) keeps the swiftly moving story engaging throughout, flagging only a bit when self- deluded toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is briefly depressed. The film hops from one great set-piece to the next with head-spinning speed that leaves me marveling at how simple director John Lasseter and the team of animators make it look to bring these toys to life with just a few touches of individuality. Every viewer will probably have their favorite parts. Back when I first saw the movie upon its initial release, mine was the new-age toys who worship the Claw; upon recent viewing, I think it is \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" rendition of evil neighbor Sid's bedroom. It's hard to remember now that Pixar has proved so successful that there was real doubt about whether its style of computer-graphics animation would be embraced by audiences -- kudos to Pixar for proving the doubters wrong. Very good!; As much as I enjoyed this film, I think the sequel was even better. One can certainly relate to Woody's jealousy of Buzz, and cheer when they've found the perfect best friend. I loved it when all the toys put evil Sid in his place, and I'm even happier that Sid wasn't in the sequel! Best of all is that Woody and Buzz never give up. Great animation and voice-overs! Exciting; Toy story is a 1995 American computer-animated adventure buddy comedy film produced by Pixar Animetion Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures, directed by John Lasseter at his directorial debut. Toy story was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first theatrical film produced by Pixar. In the film, toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present. A group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy, are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother and his sister are preparing to move the following week. The toy's leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Woody organized the other toys. Andy gets an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear as a birthday present. He believes that he is an actual space ranger. What happen to Andy's toys next? The characters have individuality. The picture on the screen is colorful, so I think the film is very cute. I am excited because I think about what happen next and what Andy's toy do next. I love the film's view of the world. Everyone enjoys the film, regardless of age or sex. I want you to watch the film. The one that started it all; In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In 1995, they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be 100% made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history. The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having \"souls\" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was. Rating: 9,5/10 The Beginning of a Classic Trilogy.; Toy Story came out on 1995 and it got 2 more sequels Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3. Story: Woody, a traditional pull-string talking cowboy, has long enjoyed a place of honor as the favorite among six-year-old Andy's menagerie of toys. Quick to calm their anxieties about being replaced by newer arrivals, Woody finds his own confidence shaken, and his status as top toy in jeopardy, upon the arrival of Buzz Lightyear, simply the coolest space action figure ever made. Woody plots to get rid of Buzz, but things backfire and he finds himself lost in the outside world with Buzz as his only companion. Joining forces to find their way home, the two rivals set out on an adventure that lands them in the clutches of Sid, a sadistic neighborhood kid who is notorious for dismembering and reassembling \"mutant\" toys in his bedroom. As \"guests\" of Sid and his dog, Scud, the two fugitive toys forge a genuine friendship and learn that only through mutual trust and respect do they have any chance of survival. Toy Story is one of the best animation movies ever made full of laughs and drama with a great cast voicing the stars and a great script and direction it's easy to say that Toy Story is still one of the best movies ever made and for sure a Classic. An amazing family film; Toy Story is a timeless classic. Probably the most genuine, innocent, simplistic yet powerful attempt to create a children film which appeals both adults and kids alike. It is the story of how two rival 'living' toys - a old western cowboy toy (Woody) and action figure of a space commander (Buzz Lightyear) become best friends under some dangerous circumstances. There are bunch of numerals toys like Mr. Potato, a Barbie, a magnifying toy, a truck, alien toys and many more. The film is crafted so well that within some few minutes of the film, you are intrigued to it. It is a fascinating film, with amazing characterization. The toys are so believable that you feel close to them. You feel cherished when Allan and his company make a spoiled brat kid Sid (who loves blowing up toys) realize how important is to save toys which bring back the memories of childhood. I must say the script is effortless and very well written. Music by Randy Newman is also great. One striking thing in this film are its sound effects and CGI which are considered ground-breaking for a 1995 film. Overall, the film is highly recommended. Not only for children, but for everyone who love cherishing the childhood memories - the lovely Toys. Toy Story and the Imagination; The film Toy Story is an animation film that changed the movie game with its technological advances used to create this bold, colorful computerized animation. Toy Story is about a boy named Andy and his love for his toys. Andy's favorite toys have a huge secret that he is not aware of, they are actually alive and become real when no one is around. Andy has a favorite toy cowboy named Woody who is the Sheriff and leader of all the other toys. Woody pride himself on being Andy's favorite toy, but that title is challenged when Andy has a birthday party and receives a new space ranger toy Buzz Light Year. In the scene that introduces Buzz Light Year, it is kind of symbolic that the new toy may be a replacement for the old cowboy Woody. As the kids rush in the room the day of Andy's birthday party Woody is thrown under the bed, and Buzz Light Year is placed on the bed in Woody's spot. Time goes by as Randy Newman's song \"You got a friend in me\" plays as the soundtrack during various scenes as Andy becomes more involved with Buzz, eventually pushing Woody to the background. The lyrics to the song could be considered an ironic montage to the mood that Woody feels during these scenes, because he is lonely and feels replaced. Buzz on the other hand is indulging in the admiration that he receives from Andy. The soundtrack to this movie as awesome, because the lyrics of the songs played like, \"you got a friend in me\", \"strange things\", and \"pop goes the weasel\". Those songs can replace the dialogue in the scenes and the audience will still be able to follow on. At Pizza Planet there is some tension between the two toys Buzz and Woody, which causes them to end up with the neighbor kid Sid, who is known to destroy his toys. Once the movie reaches this climax the characters positions change. Woody and Buzz are forced to reconcile and work together in the quest to return home. The special effects and graphics used in this animation were phenomenal. The camera angles, digital character movements, even facial expressions, helped bring the toys in the film to life. Although this film theme was surrounded by the dynamic relationship between alpha toys Woody and Buzz Light Year. The supporting characters, the relationships displayed between Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, the comedic scenes with Rex the Dinosaur and Slinky the Dog made the film more entertaining and realistic. Toy Story is a must see film for all children who has a love for toys. Watching this film will enhance a new found respect for the creativity of children's imagination. Great film about toys; Toy Story is the first fully computer-animated film. It tells the story of a cowboy toy named Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) who is jealous when a new toy arrives, Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen). Buzz thinks he's a space ranger, and is eventually \"disposed of\" accidentally by Woody. (Woody had only meant to knock Buzz behind a dresser) Woody and Buzz eventually become friends, and had it not been for that friendship, Buzz would have been . . well, I'll let you see it yourself. Toy Story, while a great film, is the only Pixar to not be among my Top 10. But still, I think it's worth watching. It may not be log enough, but not all good movies have to be 2-3 hours long. My Score: 9/10 One or two?; I have no idea which is the best, as depending on my mood either one suits me. This for my money is best for its darker aspects, Sid, Buzz and Woody's rivalry etc.       This film is not only groundbreaking with effects, but raised the bar with its smart script and proper characters. Deserves all the praise. Animation's \"Citizen Kane\"; A technological breakthrough (the first entirely digital animated feature), John Lasseter's comedy would be astonishing if only for the realism of the film's design. But Lasseter and his writers (there are six others who get credit) have fashioned a screenplay simple in story line but complex in structure and emotion; it's also rollickingly funny with a spate of memorable lines that have real depth to them. As two beloved toys vying for their owner's affection, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are splendid--they join forces with Lasseter's formidable crew to make their characters come completely alive. You feel as if you know them thoroughly by the conclusion and are moved by the life lessons they've learned, lessons you would want any child to learn. In addition to the main performers, the voice cast is perfectly suited to the toys they're called upon to represent: there's Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, the late Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex, the timid dinosaur, Annie Potts as Bo Peep and John Ratzenberger as Hamm, the talking pig. Laurie Metcalf is the voice of the child's mother. A supreme accomplishment, you can watch it over and over again and still find something new every time--it's animation's \"Citizen Kane\". The one that started it all with Pixar; In 1995 a man named John Lasseter set up his own company called Pixar which was also owned by the late Steve Jobs. So their first film was of course Toy Story. Everyone has seen this movie before its probably the best Pixar movie to date since the mid 1990s. The story is about Woody the cowboy(voiced by Tom Hanks)who is a toy along with many other toys that come to life when no one is in the room. All of the toys are owned by Andy a young boy who lives with his mom and his sister. So on the eve of Andy's birthday he ends up getting a new toy,the Buzz Lightyear toy which is a very popular toy who is a space ranger. So when Woody is introduced to Buzz Lightyear(voiced by Tim Allen)Woody ends up being jealous of him and he would do anything to be the center of attention again. But when a rough kid who lives next door accidentally gets Woody and Buzz out of a cash rending machine its up to Woody and Buzz to escape Sid's house. Overall this was a very original authentic masterpiece. The story is very good,the music is great,the charcthers are engaging and the whole set up is fantastic. Its a shame it didn't win an Oscar but at least the 2010 prequel to it won Best Animated Feature beating the likes of Tangled and How To Train Your Dragon. 9/10 Best Toy Story Movie; This movie is funny, hilarious, humorous1 It makes the whole wide world wanna laugh! This movie is so funny, you'd laugh your butt off! I liked it how Sid scared his sister but messing up her toys. I wish I can do what he does to the Animal Crossing players! They make me sick because they suck more than Justin Bieber. Also, it's funny how Woody murdered Buzz! Also Bo Peep reminds me of Princess Peach from the Super Mario series. She should have appeared in the other Toy Story movies. I can't believe they screwed up on Toy Story 3, one of the worst Toy Story movies ever! I hope they don't ever screw up Toy Story 4, which comes out next year. Amazing; This movie has something for everyone in the family. It is funny, has action, has a life story, and the characters will touch your heart. These are not just toys, this is a friendship, siblings, relationship or just a way of thinking sometimes. It is a real story on so many levels. It is a heart-warming story about a child and his toys and the relationships between the toys. In Toy Story, the two main characters are Buzz and Woody. At first Buzz and Woody can not stand each other and the two of them fight for the love of their owner Andy. Throughout the story these two show that fighting, arguing, and not getting along will get you no where in life and finally come together to help each other get back to their owner so that they can get back to their home. After all the trials and tribunals these two go through they become the best of friends and go on for two more movies to be a heroic team. Great Movie; All kids should watch this movie. It is very Funny. All the characters remind me of how good times growing up. The animation was before its time. All the toys are very courageous and dominating. Most animation movies could not keep my attention around this time, but this movie most definitely kept my eyes glued to the screen and my bottom in my theater chair. Approving each other; I watched this movie when I was an elementary student for the first time. That time, I only thought that toys are cute, or something like that. However, this film contains moral meaning, and I have not realize it until I become an adult. This film tells us the importance of things. These days, people have many things. It means we are rich. However, it's only the abundance of objective things. In toy story, a boy with many toys but does not have heart to treat toys dearly is suppose to be punished. This suggests the situation of modern society, and reminds us the importance to treat things carefully. Another point that I like in this film is, the growth of the cowboy. When he meets Buzz for the first time, he did not accept Buzz, because he couldn't understand everything about Buzz. Moreover, his position was taken over because of Buzz's appearance. However, he learns the importance of understanding other people, through the adventure to return to home. Also, Buzz finally comes to understand Woody. This means that we can understand each other even if the existence is in contrast. Good and groundbreaking; Good and groundbreaking computer animation graphics movie that delivers but does not reach a higher level due to the animation itself not having the \"warmth\" of the drawing style classic Disney animations.Still,the computer style here is very promising and quite impressive.Good story and script.A good solid start in a new trend in animation production.Very good voice acting.Only for fans of kids movies..... The Largest Part Of My Childhood Put On Screen.; With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. \"Toy Story\" was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises & confidence. How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history. I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling & technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals & entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks & Tim Allen, and almost immediately think \"Toy Story\". As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then. Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, \"Toy Story\" is that proof. 10/10. Toy Story was like the Snow White of 1995; I remember going and seeing Toy Story when I was 5 years old at the movies. I fell completely in love with it! It had great animation, great characters and a great story! My favorite character was the Slinky Dog played by my favorite comedian the late Jim Varney (God rest his soul). I loved it towards the end when Slinky is trying to get Woody and Buzz into the moving van and the others toys in the moving van pull on him so hard that he begins to stretch out! That was hilarious! I also liked it when Slinky says Come on PotatoHead! If Woody says it's all right well darn it it's good enough for me! Woody has never stared us wrong before! With Toy Story PIXAR showed us what Computer Animation could do to tell a great story! Toy Story like Snow White it an animated classic that'll go on forever! I'm hoping one day to get a job at PIXAR and I think Walt Disney would of been proud of what they've done with Toy Story and Computer Animation. God bless you Pixar Animation Studios! Great fun for anyone; Toy Story is definitely a film that a kid should watch before they are a teen. Its adventure and great sense of humour is appealing to adult audiences as well, and the atmosphere is brilliant. This really is a Toy Story. The plot is indeed quite simple, and it would have to be for a classic family. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks)is a toy 'sheriff' doll, owned by a young boy called Andy. Woodys Toy life couldn't as Andy loves him a lot, but as Andy's birthday party arises tension fills the bedroom with each toy living in fear of being replaced. Everything goes well till the last birthday present is opened.. enter Buzz Lightyear! I would be criminal to tell you the rest of the story, but as far as humour and adventure are concerned, this film impresses in both categories. The toys different personalities really contrast and make you laugh, from the smart-chat of Mr. Potatoe head, to Slinky who is Woodys best toy friend. Its so easy to follow this film - the plot and characters are easy to watch the computer graphics are top notch. Compared to modern day CGI kids films, this stands out purely because of its innocence - a simple story, theirs no techno-babble, and its really fun. This truly is the film of the Nineties! Toy Story; This was the very first computer animated film from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation, it is just excellent. It is showing what happens when the young Andy leaves his room, his toys come to life! Woody the cowboy is Andy's favourite toy, and looks after all the other toys (and he is a very good Tom Hanks voicing). Unfortunately on Andy's early birthday party he gets a new favourite toy, Buzz Lightyear the space ranger (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody obviously gets jealous and both him and Buzz end up lost, and then in evil Sid's room. For a kid, Sid is a good villain. Woody and Buzz are now trying to find a way to get back to their owner. Also starring Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Jim Varney as Slinky, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Morris as Andy, Scream 2's Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom, Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Army Sarge and Jeff Pidgeon as Green Aliens.With recognisable toys for every generation, and the Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song \"You've Got a Friend\" and Oscar nominated music by Randy Newman, this is a great family film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and a Special Achievement Award (fior creation of a feature-length computer-animated film), it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, along with the sequel, both was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons, and it was number 40 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding! Great start to a great trilogy; The beginning of a sensational trilogy , I think this is the weakest of the trilogy , more does not mean it is bad , quite the contrary , it's great movie, who would say that dolls speakers would so sure , the history of this is great , it's funny , the double Woody and Buzz is very good at the beginning Woody has envy him to be best friends, Sid movie villain is cruel , you feel a giant hatred for him , we have other characters , the soundtrack is excellent, the voice work is amazing , the brilliant Tom Hanks who is the voice of Woody , Woody scene trying to escape from Sid's house is very good and fun (remember some prison movies) , Toy Story is a classic animation, and deserves to be seen by all. Note 8.8 Lost a vote cuz it was too short!!; I want to get the recently re-released anniversary edition because this is a must have for any collection, be it animation or just good movies! What an absolutely funny, original and mesmerizing movie! I mean, come on, what kid in the history of the world doesn't, at some time, think their toys are alive. That's why girls talk to Barbie or have tea parties with all the toys, and guys chat with GI Joe and make believe the hot wheels can talk! Let's not even bring up our puppets! Pixar and Disney not only knock our socks off with the most amazing computer generated animation, but the writers of this story hit a home-run and totally captured the whimsical innocence of what we all knew was going on when we were kids; that our toys are alive and only want to be played with and cherished. In addition, the superb voice acting by a cast of actors that obviously still remember being a kid, only gives this instant classic the status of being the \"Gold Standard\" to which all others in this category will have to be judged. My only complaint and why I only give 9 out of 10, is that it is far, far too short, running 1 hour and 20 minutes! I know I'm selfish, but I want MORE!! I could and would have watched 2 or 3 hours of this! But that's why there's a Toy Story 2!! Wonderful animated feature...; TOY STORY is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. It goes along with TOY STORY 2, TARZAN, A BUG'S LIFE, THE LION KING and CHICKEN RUN as some of my favorite animated features. Tom Hank s voices Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll owned by a boy named Andy who is the most-played toy until a space ranger, Buzz (Tim Allen) comes along and Woody is not good friends with them. But one day later, a mean toy-hating man who owns a collection of mutant toys and tries to threaten Buzz, and it is up to Woody to save Buzz with the help of the mutants before it's too late to escape to Andy's new house. The sequel is better than the original, but TOY STORY is a good movie. **** An Instant Classic!; After a few short films and no major recognition-in 1991, Pixar set out to start the ball rolling for computer-animated entertainment and in 1995 unleashed not just a mere film but a work of art. An instant classic when first released...Toy Story went on to earn nearly $400 million worldwide and capture the hearts of children and adults alike with its unforgettable characters, magical musical score, hilarious script and the classic quote \"To infinity and beyond\". Woody (Tom Hanks) is an old-fashioned pull - string cowboy doll living a life of luxury as the favourite toy of a young boy named Andy. Surrounded by a colourful cast of characters - such as the cynical Mr. Potato Head, the wisecracking Piggy bank Hamm and Woody's brown-nosing second-in-command Slinky Dog - Woody seems something of a king. However, when a new toy arrives on the scene-a high tech spaceman action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Woody suddenly loses his popularity. But this toy comes with a surreal extra feature - he thinks he's the real Buzz Lightyear!! In the effort of removing Buzz as Andy's favourite toy-both toys are swept out of their home, and into the outside world where they unite reluctantly in friendship for an adventure home. Toy Story; This movie came out around the time I was born. And I especially remember watching this and Toy Story 2 (the sequel) like every day. And I remember getting sucked in to a world I'd like to live in. A world were my toys came to life. In my mind, this movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250 list. This is a movie everyone can enjoy. This is definitely Disney Pixar's best movie. Although Monster's Inc., The Incredibles, Cars, Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, and Meet the Robinsons are great. It does not come close to the magic Toy Story brings. If you have not yet seen Toy Story, where the hell have you been? It's a fantastic movie, and my favorite. So if you haven't seen it yet...Then what are you waiting for....GO!! yup; The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy). The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing. I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had. Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made  something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.' Not only for children under 10 !; I saw this really cool animated movie and I really liked it. Buzz LIGHTYEAR and WOODY didn´t get along much in that movie, but together they mastered their way out of danger. I am really looking forward seeing part two of this film. Really good animation, with almost real looking sequences, the scene with the rocket and the remote-control buggy, when BUZZ and WOODY chasing the van is really fast´n furious. Check it out, it´s worth watching it. I thought it was George CLOONEY, as the voice of BUZZ, it sounded similar, but it was Tim ALLEN. Solid entertainment for the kids...; Great animation, great voice cast. A wonderful film for children, but as an adult, I thought there was a total lack of any good jokes. All the songs seemed unnecessary and the story was pretty weak for a film so hailed by adult critics. But the 3D animation is really groundbreaking, my jaw hit the ground several times, and that's what this film is all about. ****(out of five) A Triumph For Disney!; \"Toy Story\" has been said to be the first great fully computer animated feature ever.  And I must agree.  Computer animation has been used before, in movies like \"Tron.\"  But only in \"Toy Story\" has it been used with such great effect.  Seeing animation like this is impressive.  Truly cinematic history was made with this movie!  The technology may be improving past the level it had achieved when \"Toy Story\" was made.  But you just can't forget this milestone! It's okay but over hyped; I saw Toy Story in theaters when it first came out and it was alright but I wasn't impressed. Over the years I've come to dislike it rather than feeling neutral toward it. The concept of the movie wasn't new to me because I had already seen the Jim Henson film The Christmas Toy which was basically the same but instead of Woody the cowboy being the main character it was a tiger plush toy named Rigby and I prefer puppetry over CG anyway. Given that this movie was made in the early days of CG the people look really weird and fake, almost creepy, even the good characters. It seems to mainly focus on the petty squabbles between the jealous cowboy and the delusional spaceman. While the film has a few jokes the kids might not get, my over all impression is that the whole story lacks depth. You could maybe read between the lines and infer things but the movie glosses over most of the more serious stuff to keep the mood light. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable either. Toy Story; Total Classic Disney movie, One of the best ever made in my opinion! Long loved by adults and children alike! Its a great animation about....(well if the title didn't give it away) Toys, And their adventures while in the care of Andy, a young boy who's favourite toy used to be sheriff Woddy (voiced by Tom Hanks)a cowboy doll, until one day on his birthday he receives a space doll, Buzz lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) Woody isn't too happy when he finds he has been replaced by a space toy and immediately holds a grudge over Buzz. Woody is surprised to find out that this 'Space Toy' doesn't even know he is a toy, And wouldn't believe it if you told him. Fed up over being replaced Woody tries to dispose of Buzz, the plan fails of course...but it starts Buzz and Woody on an adventure of a lifetime...or 'toytime'...which eventually brings them close together! Must see for all Disney Fans! Infinity and beyond from Disney and Pixar!; Disney and Pixar studios team up and brought us an imaginative adventure story about a little boy named Andy who loves playing with his toys, with his best friend being a cowboy doll named Woody. However, when Andy and not body else is looking, the toys come to life. Woody is the leader of the toys in Andy's room, which include a Mr. Potato Head, Slinky the Dog, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Pig and Bo-Peep the girl doll. However, when Andy's get new toy space ranger Buzz Lightyear for his birthday, Buzz takes the place of Woody of being leader of the toys and Andy's new best friend. Brewing with jealously, Woody attempts to get rid of Buzz, but both ended up lost outside of Andy's house. As a result, they must find their way back to Andy's house before they move - first trying to get through Andy's weird neighbor and toy torturer Sid. This is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation - very detailed and realistic. The story is full of surprises and adventure, from Woody and Buzz getting lost in a pizza shop to them trying to break loose out of Sid's house to get back to Andy's. The movie is also filled with comedy; you will have to watch the movie to appreciate and understand the humor only live toys could make. And, there are toe-tapping songs you would learn to love including Randy Newman's opening song \"You've Got a Friend in Me.\" While this movie's plot is full of non-stop fun and adventure, making every moment exciting and entertaining, the film also concentrates on friendship and teamwork and overcoming all odds. While I mostly enjoyed this movie, I wished that Woody was not made out to be hated on so much by the other toys after Woody's jealous behavior towards Buzz. I thought this takes away at Woody's hero status too much especially for his first movie. But overall, this is one of Disney's best work, which will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination. Also, hands down to a great voice cast: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts and Jim Varney. Grade B+ One of the great movies of all time; I enjoy watching this movie over and over. It is structured so carefully, I can pick up from any point and be immersed. I love reading about how it was made just as much as watching it, and collect books about Pixar and the making of these films. But as much as I enjoy the craft and history of Toy Story, I also think it deserves credit for its influence. It's just too bad that all the filmmakers that think they're working from the Toy Story template are missing the main ingredient: story. Pixar worked and reworked this script for years and refused to quit until they got it right. Woody and Buzz, Pizza Planet, Andy's Bedroom, Sid--I only wish I had appreciated it for what it was upon its release. But I get it now. And I will be there for whatever this company does next. A great start for good old Pixar; The story is quite predictable, but at least it makes up with the heart and execution. The animation, while dated now, was great for its time. The characters are memorable and lovable So overall, nice job Pixar. The Best Animated Movie; This is probably the best animated movie I've ever seen. The story-line and the pace of the movie keeps you pretty engaged. Tom Hanks as Woody is simply the best character introduced in an animated movie. I think should do more voice-overs. And the 2 sequels are also very good. IT'll surely bring back your childhood memories. It's a pure entertainer. Hands Down My Favorite Disney FIlm.; I just recently saw the Toy Story, Toy Story 2 double feature and it was amazing seeing this movie on the big screen after all this time. In my opinion this is the best movie Pixar has made so far, and it will be hard to top it. The animation is flawless and all of the characters are so lovable, you actually forgot that they are toys and not real people. The plot is actually really inventive and the idea of toys being jealous of one another is really fun. I think this movie is perfect for people of any age because the humor can be enjoyed by anyone. Obviously it's the perfect movie for kids, but it's great for adults too. Tim Allen and Tom Hanks lend their voices as the main characters in this film, and they are perfect in it. Overall, this movie is genuine animated classic! \"You've Got A Friend in Me...\"; I literally can't stop singing every time I hear Randy Newman play one of the greatest songs of all time. Anyway, Toy Story is one of the my all-time, no-holds barred, #1 movies of i've ever seen . Toy Story begins when Andy gets a new toy called Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen) and a bitter rivalry between Woody(Tom Hanks)and Buzz ensues. After a trick to get Buzz Lightyear stuck between a drawer goes terribly wrong, Woody knows that he can't show his face back in Andy's room without Buzz Lightyear. After an unhappy reunion at the Gas Station and a misadventure at Pizza Planet, Woody and Buzz are soon kidnapped by a sinister kid named Sid Phillips. Now, Woody and Buzz must reconcile and together, they will either think up a plan to get out of the Sid's house or be doomed under the filthy hands of the crazy kid himself. Also starring Jim Varney(From \"Hey Vern, It's Ernest!\" and all the Ernest movies) as Slinky and Don Rickles(From \"Dennis the Menace Strikes Again\" and \"Beach Blanket Bingo\") as Mr. Potato Head, Toy Story will not only have you rolling on the floor laughing, it will warm your heart. This movie is so passionate, so comical, and so heart-warming, that it spawned off two great sequels beloved for generations to come. I definitely recommend this movie to Toy Story lovers everywhere! Awesome Animated Movie!; Toy Story 3 may not be the best animated movie ever, but this is still one of them, beats the crap out of that crappy Wall-E! Anyway, it follows Woody and the toys, Woody gets jealous of Buzz Lightyear, their owners new favorite toy which of replaced Woody. Woody knocks Buzz out the window, and the other do the same to Woody because of what he did to Buzz. They both fall, then they go over to Andy's moms van, and they hitch a ride. They end up at the gas station, fight, and take the Pizza Planet car. They get there, get stuck in a toy machine with some rubber aliens, and the mean kid, Sid, gets them. And he takes them to his house, where he tortures them. And now we have our movie, did I mention the people don't know the toys are alive? No, well they don't. And this movie as amazing animation, it's perfect. Highly recommend this amazing animated movie. Ground Breaking Animation!; Toy Story is hands down the best animated film of all times. It's also a groundbreaking film with computer animation and it allowed more movie producers to explore the art. Fortunately that did happen because nowadays animated movies are staples in movie making. This is about a toy cowboy named Woody who is the favorite toy of his owner, Andy. He gets jealous when Andy gets a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. It only gets worse when both of them are missing and get stuck in evil Sid's room. The voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are probably the best well-known voices in animated films. The music by Randy Newman is fantastic. The songs and score alike are fantastic and memorable. Overall, this is the best animated film of all times and it spawned two very good sequels. I rate this film 10/10. Perfect! A badge to be worn proudly by Pixar.; Of course my opinion, but truly,honestly perfect! It is an amazing standalone, kid, and Pixar film with all the great motifs of all. It teaches children good values about who are in the world, and mortality. It also appeals to all ages and has incredible animation for 1995, and also was great enough to be unforgotten all the way until now 2015, 20 years later. Buzz's realization that he is just another product to be sold in the world, is in my opinion, one of the greatest moments of movie and entertainment history. The movie gives you a lot of things to speculate on like is Woody a bad toy? Or can a movie have virtually no villain but the hero or at all? The choice is 100% yours and that is what I love most about the movie. It is absolutely timeless and unforgettable and I highly suggest watching it.  This movie was one of the best 3d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an 8.5.(I gave it an 8) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of 3d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! The first full length CGI movie; Toy Story has become at the time of that recording 21 years old. Twenty One!! This the most influential animated movie since Snowwhite and the Seven Dwarfs, which is the every first full length movie and it came out in 1937!! OK to pull myself together ,I am pretty sure that the majority of you, who read this is under 18 and can not think of a time before all animated movies used CGI. And the amazing part is almost everyone though that Toy Story would be flop and their luck of faith, although disturbing, was way off. Also the characters like Woody, Buzz, Rex and the rest of the gang have rooted in pop culture and its sequels are awesome in their own right. In all honesty I cannot choose which of the three is better I love them all equally. To summaries Toy Story is one of the best family flick ever made and you should show it to your kids and maybe re-watch, yourself dear writer, all the trilogy with the Toy Story 4 coming out in 2017!  \n",
       "1  Wonderful adventure; My opinion: Do not underrate this movie that much. I didn't particularly like it - in fact I almost forgot about it for many years - but the story is simply very, very smart. The idea behind the plot is utter genius. Okay, the actual transformation did not work perfectly, but I insist that it was still a straight accomplishment that had 1. a nice cast, 2. sustainable visual effects and achievements, 3. a great story, 4. both funny and entertaining sequences, that even made you pause and think sometimes, which I regard as a major attainment of any movie. So - I'll give it a solid 7, which it deserves at least. Considering it has Robin Williams in it, it is okay.; I am not really a huge fan of Robin Williams, his type of humor does not usually work for me. In fact, I always thought Mork and Mindy was where he did his best comedy. This movie is about a boy who disappeared while playing a board game. His sister who was playing at the time saw him disappear into said game and is basically a bit crazy later in her life thanks to this incident. Two children find and play this game one day and to their surprise the boy who disappeared has reappeared thanks to a roll of the dice. They now have to continue to play the game as things begin to pelt them, animals run amok, and a determined continually hunts the foursome down. The effects are okay for the time, but they are the type of effects that are in to many movies these days. The type that looks like they are there, but at the same time they do not. The comedy is okay, Robin Williams does not get as worked up in this one as he usually does in his films and you also get to see a young Kristen Dunst. This one coming out after her appearance in Interview with a Vampire. David Alan Grier also stars as a cop who gets caught up in the game as near the end the game really begins to cause quite a lot of chaos. Still, it is an effects driven family film so the story is a bit shallow. So worth a chuckle and it does have a lot to look at, but at times it seems almost like you are watching a video game rather than watching four people play a board game. Not board; Watched this on TV where it was aired as a tribute to the late Robin Williams. It's an enjoyable family-entertainment fantasy adventure with Williams playing a grown man who as a boy was sucked into a mysterious, dark board game called Jumanji, freed years later by a couple of young children who happen upon the game when they move into Williams's character by this time run-down house. Along with Williams also fully-grown girl friend of the time Kirsten Dunst, the four of them brave everything the game throws at them to finish it and free Williams to return to his old life. And does the game throw everything at them! Crazy monkeys, a roaring lion, a jungle which comes to life, hordes of stampeding elephants zebras and rhinos and one very persistent big game hunter. A veritable special effects fest, while the plot amounts to no more than awaiting the outcome of the next roll of the dice on the board, it all makes for good clean exciting fun and who amongst us as never enjoyed playing a board game as a child. The back stories about Williams being bullied as a child, having a fractious relationship with his dad and his adult wooing of Dunst are lightly drawn but all of course resolved happily ever after by the end. Williams is fine after he makes his delayed first appearance, portraying yet again a child trapped in a man's body just as he did in a line going back through Peter Pan in \"Hook\", \"Popeye\" all the way to his breakout part in \"Mork and Mindy\". Dunst offers good support and the kids aren't too gauche and sentimental either. Nice to see \"Cheers\" Bebe Neuwirth get a decent part too. I wouldn't call it Robin Williams defining role but as an update on the old children's matinée features, this was an entertaining feature made the better by Williams engaging performance. R.I.P. to him. Underrated, I think; This film is a lot better than others have ranked it. It deserves more than a 6 average. I gave it a 7 and believe it's underrated. The basic story is that years ago, while a child, Robin Williams was transported into the game he was playing at the time and trapped there. Later, two other children find the game board and play it, releasing a now grown up Williams, along with all sorts of dangerous animals and vines and stuff. These things threaten mankind and it's up to Williams, along with Bonnie Hunt, to find a way to stop these things from killing off man. There's a good bit of suspense and with every move the heroic folks make, something counteracts it and things nearly always end up being worse than before. They finally determine that the only way to end the horror is to finish the game that Williams started all those years ago. Now, if they could only find the game board. This is a well written adaptation of a popular book, and I found it quite entertaining. a game not like the other ones; \"Jumanji\" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game \"jumanji\" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy. Watchable Effects-laden family entertainer, though a bit predictable; This is a watchable family entertainer with some genuine scares. The plot appears complicated but is actually fairly simple. Hordes of wild animals appear and people flee. This happens again and again like clockwork throughout the film making it predictable after a while. On the plus side, Robin Williams is in manic form, and the Special Effects are agreeable though dated. Kirsten Dunst is very appealing in one of her earlier films. This is generally a pleasant watch, but on the whole, I prefer the newer film Zathura, which is also based on a board game. Overall 6/10 18 years of being a \"favourite\"; I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and \"Jumanji\" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie & it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life. Has more depth than the book, but lacks much of its lustre; When I was in fifth Grade, I read a book called Jumanji. It was a 1982 book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera. A year later (February or March 1996), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In 1869, two young chaps bury in a chest \"Jumanji\", a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy. 100 years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in 1969, but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight\"; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic 1995, where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost... Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm. The other three characters, but the movie is so focused on the four players that everyone else looks like a decoration set. The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining . But the screenplay touches on the drama scenes so lightly that they do not create much justice to the film. The anarchic present looks like a throwback of Back to the Future II's Alternate 1985. But all ends well at the conclusion, and people will find it likable, including those who read the book. By the way, this was the first time I heard about Kirsten Dunst... **1/2 out of **** HORRIBLE!; This was on TV again recently, and naturally the kids stopped to watch it. Why I will never know. We own a copy and they rarely if ever put it in the VCR. Whose idea was this movie? Joe Johnston, the guy responsible for some of the worst movies of the 1990s and whose only really decent film was HONEY, which was way back when? I have said previously this is really a horror movie in disguise and obviously not a particularly good one. What in hell is with the special effects? Is there a worse-looking set of animals in film history? I wonder all these years later if maybe the distorted, cartoonish look of the monkeys and lion were intentional, since they sprang from a children's board game. But then why do the elephants, rhinos, pelican and even the oversized mosquito, look relatively normal? Robin Williams is about as bad as he ever got, except for the nightmarishly bad JACK (although I never saw his ripoff of Benigni, which I can just imagine to what depths he plummets, and I forgive him WHAT DREAMS MAY COME since he obviously did not write or direct that fiasco). View JUMANJI at your own mental peril! One of my favourite films ever; This film is great, it is definitely a family film (little kids might get scared when there are *SPOILER* guns shooting or when the giant spiders have surrounded the actors,or when a crocodile attacks the man but apart from that it isn't too scary), but it is one of those films everyone has got to see. I first watched this film when it first came onto TV (they now repeat it every year), and I have been captivated by the imaginative story every single time I've seen it. The basic storyline is that two kids find an old board game, but when they start playing, the madness begins- stampeding animals and more! This is a story about friendship, love, sticking together and much, much more. If you haven't seen this film already WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!! Action and adventure for the kids, and Robin Williams for the adults; Find a comfortable chair, lay out the board, grab the dice, and get ready to play.  But remember:  once you start this game, you can't stop.  If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must. \"Jumanji\" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  The basic premise stays the same:  a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure.  When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things.  Only finishing the game will make it all go away. In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added.  Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself.  He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing.  The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams!  Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter. Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles.  He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt.  The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the \"This is MY baby\" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike. Not for 13+ age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for 1980 not for 1995. Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. I love this movie so much; If you do not love this movie you are crazy. Its filled with action and excitement. I love Sarah Whittle played by the famous Bonnie Hunt. I also like Carl Bentley, a clueless police officer played by the comedian David Alan Grier. This movie is so creative. My sister and I watch the movie every weekend, we do not get tired of it. This movie did not get the awesome rating it deserved. People sometimes do not understand a quality move when they see one. I would strongly, strongly, strongly recommend the movie. Trust me you will love it to death. If you do not... then you are odd. Please watch the movie, try it you'll love it...duh!!! A great movie; JUMANJI I loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today! The movie is about a boy who finds a board game called Jumanji. When he takes it home and starts to play it with a friend, he soon realises that this is no ordinary game. He gets sucked into the game and is not released again until 26 years later 2 more kids find the game and release him. Now he is grown up and has to find a way to end this game before everything it releases destroys the town. Due to the sad passing of the genius that was Robin Williams, the TV channels have decided to show all of his movies. Jumanji was the first one I saw. The story to this film is like not her that I had seen before. It was an original idea (unless there is another film I don't know about) that was just so imaginative. It works really well and has a great adventure element about it. The effects are average. This was made in the mid 90s so that probably has something to do with it. The animals were obviously not real. You could see the lion was so mechanical it made me laugh. And the other animals were so obviously computer generated. But it was comical and that just added to the fun of the film. The acting was great. The main character was played by Robin Williams. He was as energetic and full of character in this role, just like he brought to every role he took. Other cast members were Jonathan Hyde, a young Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bonnie Hunt. Bonnie Hunt was brilliant. Her reaction and facial expressions made me laugh a few times in this. Another stand out performance was by David Alan Grier. David was so funny as the cop. His comedy timing was excellent and deserves a mention. This film really does keep you entertained throughout and is just a lot of fun to watch... Even now nearly 20 years later. I will give this 7 out of 10. Normally I end my reviews with a quote from the movie, but this time I just want to say how gutted I am about the news of Robins death. I am a fan of his work. I watched Mork and Mindy when I was a kid and grew up watching Jumanji, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam, Jack etc... There were so many great films that he made. I always saw Robin as so full of energy and full of life. He had one of the greatest smiles in Hollywood and when i saw an interview with him, he seemed so chirpy and happy. It just shows that in front of the camera, you never know what is going on in people's heads. I was sad to hear he had been suffering from depression. Depression is such a deadly illness. I know this sounds stupid, but I am gutted that I was not there to talk to him, help him. I hate to think that he felt so alone, especially as he had millions of fans all over the world that knew him on screen. He made the world laugh out loud so many times. Even through bad times in my life, watching his movies has put a smile on my face. Robin deserved much more happiness than he got. He gave so much to me and the rest of the world and it doesn't seem right that he should end his life this way. I will miss seeing new movies from him, but will always continue to go back to enjoy his old ones. Robin will live on in my house and he will always continue to make me smile. R.I.P. Robin Williams. Jumanji  a timeless adventure story; There are few children's movies that I particularly enjoyed  I can recount The Borrowers, Labyrinth and The Neverending Story. Jumanji, however takes a new place among children's films  in fact, it may seem that initially, Jumanji is about simplistic story about kids playing a board game. Based on a gorgeous picture book story of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg, this movie takes a beautiful magical adventure and makes it into a thrill ride that defies all natural laws. Time travel, physical transformations, perceptual distortions and multiple universes are just a few of the things that Jumanji toys with. The most evident phenomena is that the characters run in two different and parallel universes, one where Jumanji exists, and the other where it is just a dream. The life of Judy and Peter as orphans exists in a different world from the one where Jumanji doesn't exist  in other words, Jumanji is a catalyst of fate, an evil entity that does not bring about awe as it did in Allsberg's book, but fear. The world that Allen Parrish is doomed to be incarcerated in the jungles of Jumanji is another one, but that period of time is nonexistent in the world he will eventually live in. This is the beauty of the movie; that these characters can only allow their trauma and epiphanies to cross worlds. With each roll of the dice, the characters grow and change. The ending with 'Jumanji' is mark of the end of that universe  everything that the jungle world had yielded, from the colonist-hunter Van Pelt to the roaring stampede and the monkeys had to return, to be sealed into the game and the universe. The game controls life; but it is merciful when played to the end without cheating. The mental agony and pain must have been tremendous for the Parrishes. Presumably, Alan spent his twenty six years in the jungle, but returned to his old self only to again relive his life as if it never happened. The temporal distortion must have presumably had an effect on his parents, although only Sarah seems to notice. (She was playing the game  and only those playing are directly affected, but in the game universe of Judy and Peter we see a problem in the movie's understanding of temporal change) The power of fate in deciding the endgame was critical in the film. It seems that the game was in itself a game of a game; it was all planned out and ready to go. In fact, it also seems that no matter how crazy or perilous the situation is, the characters cannot be killed. Even Van Pelt says at the Sir Sav A Lot that \"I am hunting only Alan. I won't kill you, since you didn't roll\" He too is bound to the rules of the game, no matter how much of a colonialist he is. The game instills a high level of fear without death, in order for the game to continue, all the characters must be present. So in one way, no one need be scared of anything in the game. Instead, the game builds resilience in the characters. It was natural that in the end the end was initiated by the future; or more appropriately the past. At the end, both Sarah and Alan make up for the trouble they have caused and have a life bond from the experience. The jumping between 1994 and 1964 is a critical aspect where we see that the horrors of the game have allowed Judy and Peter's parents to not die in the ski accident. They are oddly willing to put an end to their vacation when they hardly know the Parrishes \"In the jungle, you must wait, until you roll a five or eight\"  Jumanji \"Roll a two, roll a four, but never ask for more\"  Gautam RATING: 10/10 (amazing) Great fun; Robin Williams is in his element as an adult/child and with wonderful support from Kirsten Dunst, Ian Richardson playing the Englishman hunter and sending himself up nicely, the excellent children and others make this escapist adventure at it's best. A Dazzling Film!; I liked Jumanji. It is way better than I thought it would be. The story starts out with the burying of a game in 1869. It is then uncovered by a boy named Alan, 100 years later. As he is playing it, he gets sucked into the game until someone rolls a 5 or an 8. That happened 26 years later. Now along with two kids and a woman who was playing the game with Alan in 1969, Alan has to finish the game despite all the creatures appearing out of the game. The special effects are amazing. They were effective and used well. The acting is decent. Robin Williams did a good job as he usually does. I did think that Hunter Van Pelt could've been more realistic. The music is pretty good. I always liked James Horner's music. There are only minor flaws here or there. I rate this movie 9/10. Better than the sequel!; I really enjoyed this movie. I saw the sequel first, and then the \"original\" and I must say I am impressed and surprised by the way the movie worked. And I enjoyed it a lot. It's a board game that, when you roll dice, the numbers state where your piece should go, and then a message appears. The message could be something like, \"run away before the lion gets you\" and sure enough, a lion will suddenly appear in your house, ready to get you! I rate this 8/10 because of the fact that there was mild swearing, and I thought it was pushing it with the kiss at the end. But overall I enjoyed the movie! Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Welcome to the jungle, we've got fun and games; Oh yes, another childhood favourite starring the late-great Robin Williams, a true master of his craft. Jumanji simply put is a bundle of fun, why analyse a film like this? Truth is you shouldn't, just sit back and let the wacky action take you away..., it has wild animals, a dangerous board game and a throwback from the 19th century, intent on murdering Alan (poor Robin Williams!) So as a child Alan discovers a board game called Jumanji, but this is no ordinary game, he enlists his good friend Sarah to play it with him, unfortunately for the poor lad, he rolls the wrong number and gets sucked into the game, for many years. Years later, two kids Judy and Peter rediscover the game that had been hidden and decide to play, quickly releasing Alan from his jungle prison, from here on in the action is frantic and joyous, with a race around town, an adult Sarah joining the game and many-many mishaps as the quartet anxiously try to complete the game and get to the end. Who on earth thought a film about a board game could be so good? Masterful, cute and camp comedy by the legend of the genre helps to lift the film up to lofty heights, a very young Kirsten Dunst and an always reliable Bonnie Hunt put in professional performances as well..., a proper Sunday afternoon film that's a surefire way to boost moral. For 1995 when Jumanji was released, the special effects and computer generated imagery were spectacular, to make the variety of animals appear so lifelike was amazing..., the carnage that spreads across town was well shot and the cinematographer and art department team had a real good eye for detail. There's a new Jumanji film soon to be released, kind of a sequel to this film starring The Rock, but the new film will have to go some way to living up to the original, I doubt it will be anywhere near the quality and enjoyment that this film possesses, The Rock instead of Robin Williams, and that's going to work how? Sit down, relax and enjoy, with Jumanji it's as simple as that. Brilliant family entertainment!; While I try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, I do think the rating for this film is too low. The film is absolutely fantastic in all departments. I will admit, there are some bits that are quite scary due to some scenes that are amazingly dark. The film does start off slowly, but when the film fast forwards to twenty six years later, the film turns into fast-paced family entertainment. Other than one or two scary scenes and the slow beginning, I could find very little wrong with Jumanji. The story is great, very intriguing and filled with humour, scares and poignancy. The cinematography and scenery are constantly breathtaking, and the special effects are extraordinary. The film is aided by a hilarious and poignant script, spirited direction, atmspheric music and the fact that it goes at a very fast pace. Even the acting was great, with Robin Williams in one of his best performances as Alan Parrish. While he is subtle in places, the director allows him to be funny, which is what he does best. Bonnie Hunt is good too and she and Williams have great chemistry, and Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst are cute and lively. Plus the ending is nice and satisfying. All in all, I love this movie, even with its very minor problems, it is non-stop fast paced family entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Exciting Family Adventure; In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called \"Jumanji\", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished. Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human. The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like \"Dead Poet's Society\" or \"Good Morning, Vietnam\"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality. This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor. Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the \"Narnia\" stories). Fortunately, any moralising in \"Jumanji\" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of \"alternative timelines\". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10 Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is 1969, and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats. 26 years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good! wild CGI destruction gets repetitive; In 1869, two boys bury a mysterious dangerous wooden chest. In 1969 Brantford, New Hampshire, young Alan Parrish gets picked on by bullies. He finds the box in a local construction site. He opens the chest to find a board game Jumanji. His father is sending him to boarding school. He is about to run away when his best friend Sarah Whittle comes by. They play the game and Alan is pulled into the board game. Twenty six years later, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) buys the rundown mansion planning to open a bed-and-breakfast. She brings her niece Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter (Bradley Pierce) who lost their parents in a car accident. The kids find the board game in the attic and start playing it. Alan (Robin Williams) is released. They track down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) to finish the game and bring all the released apparitions to an end. Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) was a friend who worked at Alan's shoe factory and is now a cop. The game brings out big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) who looks like Alan's father Sam. The basic idea of a board game that comes alive is one with great possibilities. I wish that it is more than just a series of crazy CGI destruction. I wish that the players needed to use their brain power to solve clues. The constant escaping from one thing to the next gets a little bit repetitive. They start piling on top of one another. Williams is not quite as lovable as expected. Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier are kind of fun. There is an uncontrolled quality to this children's movie. i miss my childhood; 6.6,,,,,,,,,,,,, i don't believe this. 10 people 10,,, anyone who have watched this as a kid will give this a 10... common for heavens sake,,, this is the best fantasy movie that some one could wish for as a kid.......... for heavens sake this movie was not made keeping logic in mind please,, its just fun,,, thats all it is,,,this movie is one of the best memories A KID OF 90S HAVE AS A KID,,,people who hate this movie can go to hell,,,, any parents out there please let your kids watch this,,, they will love you a lot..these are the kind of movies which make me miss my childhood ,,, Jumanji Lays Down The Smack!; This is a great Hollywood thrill ride of a movie.  I loved the idea for this flick, a mystical board game coming to life.  What's great about this film is that for once Robin Williams isn't doing his usual \"Robin Williams\" stand-up schtick.  He's playing an original character and it's about time too, daddy-o. This movie is a great blend of thrills, special effects and laughs.  I like how it uses a lot of the old jungle movie icons like the Great White British Hunter, giant crocs, lions, mischievous monkeys and rhinos.  And even the actual Jumanji game board itself looked cool!  I wanted to own one.  I write screenplays myself on occasion and this film made me wanna write my own special effects extravaganza! But go checkety check out Jumanji and have a great time at the movies. Dig?  Dangerous Boarding Game; In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called \"Jumanji\" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan's father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. \"Jumanji\" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90's. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Jumanji\" Watts meets New England; Disaster visits a New England town: When all hell breaks loose, when beasts from nowhere trample the streets and earthquakes rip the blocks and giant mosquitoes and God-knows-what-next befall the descendants of pilgrims and fishermen, of Minutemen and revolutionaries and of immigrants yearning to breath free, those same hard-scrabble, salt-of-the-earth, no-nonsense patriots all join hands, pull together, and-- . . . loot their neighbors' downtown storefronts! Unbelievable.  Tinseltown belts out a fairly well-done and imaginative fantasy (which truly `Jumanji' is), and then--wouldn't you know it?--foul it with one of the many flies stuck in the ointment that is Hollywood, a scene so diagnostic of the intellectual sickness that has infested the industry since Hellman sang her praises to Stalin.  Then again, maybe it is believable. `Jumanji's' only other flaws: a part too small for the underrated Bebe Neuwirth (a joy to watch always and here no less so), kids full of bravery that's a little too scripted and moments of suspense that really aren't. If we can ignore all that, even the brief bit of class-warfare propaganda, then \"Jumanji' becomes eminently watchable, even memorable. But promise us you won't loot any stores next time you see monkeys charging down the street. If I could go back...; I love this movie. I don't know why. Maybe because I wonder what it would be like to start my life over again when I was 10 or 12, knowing what I know now at...well, much older. My favorite part is at the end, when Alan and Sarah come face to face in 1995 with the 2 kids who played the game with them the PREVIOUS 1995. Visually very interesting and not a rip off of any other film, that's for sure! When your life hangs on a simple roll of dice...; NOTE: this comment is provided by Christopher Dorian and Peter Rhydon. When young Alan Parish and his friend Sarah Wittle sat in Alan's living room and began playing to that strange game named \"Jumanji\", neither them, nor the audience, could have expected what was coming after. Because \"Jumanji\" is not your parents' \"Payday\". The game instructions are simple: roll the dice and the player who reaches the end first is the winner. It's just in-between that things go a little bit different... What was just a little game meeting transforms into a special effects extravaganza, filled with all sorts of creatures and eye-catching action scenes and stunts that seem to be borrowed from the best moments of the Indiana Jones adventures. The computerized special FX are the main aspects of the movie and they mostly succeed to their task. While they may look archaic today, remember that these visual tricks were created in 1995, and that computer-driven movies were a new sensation. Looking at the lion's faces isn't completely interesting, but it's worth the effort. Action scenes are well conceived, well acted, and well pictured. Particularly memorable is the crocodile fight in the flooded house, with the characters trying to defend themselves like the Orca crew in \"Jaws\". Those two points are tightly linked with one man: director Joe Johnston, who previously made \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\" and \"The Pagemaster\". He clearly shows that his former employers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had a huge effect on him and that he gets inspiration from those two phenomenons. And when we see the final result, we could feel that Johnston could become a phenomenon too. But it isn't the case. And why? Because \"Jumanji\" relies on a quicksand storyline and poor lines, because characters are occasionally believable and because action scenes are not epic in the Star Wars or Indiana Jones style. The concept is excellent, but the developed elements are not on the same level. Characters are often performing in cliché and predictable scenes, instead of innovative situations. If we talk about the actors, one should prevail from the others: Robin Williams. Even if his grinning smile looks stuck on his face like The Joker, he is a convincing jungle raider and his performance is fantastic, whatever it is for dramatic, terrifying or comic moments. What is also good about the film is that it can be enjoyed by people from all ages. Children will be delighted and excited by the animals depicted here and adults will enjoy the magnitude of the special effects employed during the film. The dialog is generally well suited for a general audience and there is no real troubling or disturbing moment. It's good to see that the '90s still deals with that kind of stuff. Technological developments imply more and more sophisticated video games of all kinds, but it's heart-warming to see that classic board games can provide excitement like this. After seeing that movie, playing \"Monopoly\" would seem to be like a tea party or some other kind of silly joke. Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... Epitome of Moronic Hollywood Film-Making; A previous reviewer wrote: \"A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie.\" I agree in part and disagree in part with that comment. The problem is impossible to pinpoint, because there are PLENTY of \"big problems\" with this movie! \"Random hazard generator\" is the PERFECT description of the ancient board game! Random hazard after random hazard until the game ends is what is supposed to pass for \"plot\" in this movie. Did anybody count how many times the game board fell out of and back into the players' hands? That, too is supposed to pass for tension. Ultimately, the film fails because there isn't any development of the back story. What was the origin of the game? Now, that would have been an interesting question to explore! And how does the game work? All we ever see is the game's projection of \"random hazards\" OUTWARD into the reality of the players, but somehow Alan (Robin Williams) apparently was sucked INTO the game. How did that happen, and why doesn't it happen to any of the current players of the game? Actually, the guy in the pith helmet is, more or less, the human villain in this movie, but he is never more than an inexplicable, evil cartoon. Was he, too sucked into the game like Alan, or is he the sole human \"random hazard\" generated by the game? Why is he so determined, not to hunt animals, but to MURDER Alan? The film just glosses over the fact that this sub-plot is actually one of premeditated murder! The hunter guns for Alan simply because the plot demands it. But the movie makes no attempt whatever to explain the character. Never once did I sense any genuine emotional chemistry among the characters. Just a bunch of actors acting - not INTERACTING. The love story sub-plot felt obligatory, never genuine. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt never generated enough chemistry to make me care whether Alan and Sarah got together in the predictable end. All in all, this film has the germ of an interesting idea that is really wasted by focusing on mindless, non-stop \"random hazards,\" poor CGI effects, \"lots of screaming and running around\" and insufficient character development. Except for the precise nature of each \"random hazard,\" the whole film was disappointingly predictable, including the cliché of the almost-kiss in the midst of peril routine. How many zillion times has that been used? The dialog is a similarly endless stream of clichés. The issue was never HOW the game would end - but WHEN. The more interesting issues were never even glanced at. This kind of movie can only appeal to people raised on video games. It was generated by that kind of adventure-for-the-sake-of-adventure mentality, and it has that same kind of feel. This Ain't No Game!; CONTAINS SPOILERS In 1869, two boys bury something unknown but whatever it is, it's very dangerous. It stays for 100 years. In 1969, young Alan Parrish rides his bike one lovely day, unfortunately he's soon chased by Billy Jessup and his gang. Alan goes to his father, Samuel's shoe factory. Alan tells his father what's up, but his father merely tells him that he must stand and face something you're afraid of, so Alan did and got the crap kicked out of him. Suddenly, he heard drums beating. It was in a construction site. He dug up a wooden board game called Jumanji. At home, Alan's parents have announced that they shall send him to Cliffside School for Boys. Alan refuses to go. Samuel get's mad and storms out of the house with his wife. Alan's friend, Sarah Widdle, comes over that night and the two decide to play the game Alan found. It resulted in Alan being sucked into the game until someone would roll a 5 or 8. 26 years later-1995. A woman named Nora, her niece Judy and nephew Peter buy the old Parrish house. One aternoon, while Aunt Nora left for the office and the kids were about to leave for school when they hear drums beating. The game was calling. They dig it out of the attic and decide to play it. Out of the game comes monkeys, mosquitos and a lion! Also, Alan comes out. He's very grateful, then goes to the old shoe factory to find his parents. He learns of their passing; by finishing the game, they can put an end to the wild animal attacks, so the three go off to find Sarah Widdle, because according to the game, it was her turn. At first she was reluctant to play, but she did. They encounter a huge pod plant and a hunter, Van Pelt who wants to kill Alan for some reason. Well, after braving a stampede, a huge rain fall, giant spiders and an earthquake, the game was over and all went back to 1969 where Alan patched things up with his father, he and Sarah get rid of the game and live happily ever after in the bright and cheerful 1995, rather than the dark one Jumanji had created. Pretty good movie! Nice special effects. Robin Williams was good, as always. Bonnie Hunt was good. The kids were too. Kirsten Dunst grew up to play Spiderman's love interest. Also, the same actor that plaus Samuel Parrish (Jonathan Hyde of Richie Rich) also plays Van Pelt. I hear there's going to be a sequel: Jumanji 2. But it doesn't have Robin Williams. For the life of me, I can't figure out what it will be like. But for now, you gotta see the first one! -- Jumanji! From Book to Film; As a child in 1995, this was one of the greatest adventure films for a kid in my generation. The book from where it came, was good, but the filmmakers made the adaptation pretty darn amazing. The fact that Robin Williams starred made the film better, as Robin was a huge draw to family films of that era. Who ever knew that Jumanji would have a cult following or that it would spawn an actual board game (nothing comes to life), and eventually a sequel in 2017. Too bad Robin isn't here to enjoy or be a part of the sequel. Bonnie Hunt also starred alongside Robin in this film as Sarah, but she's not quite as memorable. Sorry! David Alan Grier also co-starred as Carl the police officer, his acting was somewhat more memorable. One of the most memorable acting performances of the film was Jonathan Hyde as Sam Parrish (Alan's dad) and his dual role as Van Pelt (the hunter from Jumanji). In the end, it was a great film, probably felt more now by some since the passing of Robin Williams. But those of us who've loved the film since the beginning know he made the film what it was. Ignore the critics on this one--it's a great romp that gets better with time!; **Warning--Spoilers** We've owned Jumanji on video since it was released in 1996 and pull it out a couple of times each year for kicks.  It's as fun today as the first time we saw it with plenty of twists and plot turns to keep you hooked through the closing credits.  I've read the reviews by several of the critics on IMDB, and it is obvious they just don't get it. Criticism #1:  \"Jumanji is too scary for kids\":  Our children (ages 2 to 11) have all seen this at an early age and none was ever the slightest bit frightened.  Jumanji doesn't scare kids because 1) the dangers are never prolonged; 2) there is a ton of humor interwoven in the dialogue; and 3) everyone knows it's just a game.  After all, the pranks in Jumanji are no more harmful than what you see in Looney Tunes or Roadrunner & Coyote and kids instinctively get that. Criticism #2: \"Jumanji has no story\": wrong again.  Every time we watch it, something new comes out, particularly in the relationships between the main characters.  There are particularly poignant moments between the father and son characters allowing them to reconcile and overcome the aloofness that can keep men from coming to grips with their feelings toward each other. And, the Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt relationship has a great payoff with romance and their triumph over forces of nature (real and implied). There are also numerous humorous details and themes that run through the film from stampeding rhinos to run-a-muck monkeys that keeping you laughing throughout the entire film. Criticism #3: \"The special effects overwhelm the story\":  The film is based on an animated children's book and the special effects intentionally mirror the artwork from the book.  My kids oohed and ahhed at each and every FX enhanced adventure from the stampeding animals to the wood floor turning to quicksand and in each case the result was to stimulate a great deal of discussion about the ideas in the story.  The monkeys are particularly funny evoking squeals of laughter as they embark on their high jinx. So, don't let bad reviews deter you from seeing this flick.  You and your family will have a great time during the movie and your kids will want to talk about every aspect of Jumanji after it's over, even if it's just an excuse not to go to bed on time! The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for 25(?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\"  So you'll help us?; Robin Williams is incredible as Alan in this outstanding adventure movie. The supporting cast is phenomenal. The costumes are conservative. One of the good films in the genre, Jumanji will dare the viewer to play the game. 7 out of 10. When two kids from the 60's stumble upon a game, one of them is sucked into its jungle.  Now it's up to two present day kids to finish it.; ********/10 This movie deserves more than it received because it is not only a very different plot but has excellent character development, which is key to a great movie. The special effects are so-so (due to the time period in which it was made), but it is overall exciting while humorous. There isn't a movie quite like this one, and is one of my favorites. Robbin Williams is tremendous and while watching it you forget his true identity. Kerstien Dunst is young, but is impressive for her age, commonly not found in some movies. I guess if I'd have to sum this movie up in one word it'd be \"unique\". Not many films have monsoons indoors or mansions turned into jungles. Entertaining...but one major problem; Jumanji is an entertaining movie. I'm surprised its IMDB \"User Rating\" is only 5.9. I would give it a 7. However, I don't understand why the kids (and Robin Williams) keep playing the game. With every roll of the dice, they put their lives in more jeopardy...along with the lives of everyone in the city. They could have stopped anytime after the bats or the mosquitoes or the monkeys or the lion. But they kept going (under the guise of \"finishing the game is the only way to make everything return to normal\"). I kept yelling at the screen, \"Stop playing Jumanji and you'll be okay.\" Of course, if they had stopped playing the game, then there's no movie. not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late 1960s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ A little adventurous... and childish.; Jumanji is a great idea.  The movie has great potential and could have turned out excellent and a true action classic. However, some aspects of the movie prevent that.  For example, the monkeys in the kitchen and abroad hardly look like monkeys.  They look like warped, evil, demonic beings with fur and tails that were only made to cause mischief.  Well, sure, you might say that's what the game meant to do, but come on... I think they should have used real monkeys here. Certain parts of the dialogue are a little corny and make one feel as though we're watching \"Spy Kids\", which can sometimes really ruin the feel that they're in a life-or-death situation. The acting was great (some parts it was not), and as usual, Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst put on an above-average performance. The action and crashes and other sequences are a contradiction, in a way.  Here we have fake-looking monkeys, but superbly crafted action. The music, composed by James Horner, is quite dull and does not help get you into the spirit of the movie.  A lower-than-average job on his part. Overall, this movie is really good.  I would suggest watching it if you can get past some annoying areas of the movie. Almost 20 years on and it's still entertaining kids of all ages; Jumanji was on TV today, and my 8 year old son had liked him in \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and I remembered it being fun, so with sweets and crisps we sat down to watch it. Orphans Judy (A young Kristen Dunst, who had started in \"An Interview With A Vampire\" the previous year, but still a few years away from Spiderman fame) and Peter move in to a mansion with their Aunt (Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers) where the find a board game called Jumanji. When they start playing, they free Alan Parish (Robin Williams) who was trapped in the game when he was a child. Robin Williams is always fun to watch and he was very popular at the time, due to movies like \"Aladdin\" and \"Mrs Doubtfire\" and Kristen Dunst was a real talent as a young actress, none of the annoying traits of usual child actors. Of the supporting cast David Alan Grier is fun as a hapless Police Officer, as is Jonathan Hyde in duel roles as a hunter and young Alan's Dad. Defo worth checking out if you have kids, and more than enjoyable even if you don't. Some of the special effects have dated badly, but are still OK, most of the humour is spot on too. My son got a big kick out if it and really enjoyed it. And I thought for a 19 year old special effects laden kids movie it had held up pretty well. An enjoyable board game, so an enjoyable movie!; This is one of the movies that I really enjoy, even if I do not like comedy and fantasy that much, by the way I don't like Robin Williams either, he thinks he's a funny person, but he isn't, some of his movies like `Jack', `Good Will Hunting', and some others are quite bad. Most of his movies leave too much to be desired. He's just annoying, because it seems to me that he thinks that everybody who sees him will laugh at the ridiculous things he does, he enjoys making fun of the human body, women, men, etc. I dislike it enormously; however I must say that I really enjoyed this movie even though he was starring and the visual effects were obviously computerized. I was impressed by the originality of Jumanji. It's such an innovative, interesting and enjoyable movie. I liked it because the plot is extremely original, creative and gripping. Who on earth would be able to think of a game like Jumanji? An imaginative game in which journeys, action, fantasy, and perhaps a little bit of terror surpass all things. I like this movie because it teaches us to enjoy everyday to its fullest, we see that Alan Parker was a frustrated kid at the beginning of the movie, but after staying in the jungle until the dice read 5 or 8, he realized how worthy his life was. Also it teaches us to respect others, for instance we see the little boy who began to turn into a wolf after cheating on the game was crying and Alan who was a grown-up person then yelled at him, and made him feel bad, but after that he was sorry since he remembered the way his father yelled at him, so this is a valuable lesson, since it shows that parents must be patient and loving to their family, but sometimes love can be hazardous to them. `Jumanji' is a nice movie for all ages; it's a very risky, but enjoyable game, in which your life is at stake. The board game (Jumanji) was good looking, it was really mysterious and interesting, whoever saw it would love to play it. Overall the movie was a very good one, I enjoyed every minute and especially Kristin Dunst's performance who also played in \"Spiderman\", I also enjoyed Mr. Williams's performance, I'm glad he at last did something worth it. Anyway it was an enjoyable movie, but I'd have loved this if it had been more dramatic, terrifying, sad, etc. 8/10 Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. Game You Could Only Dream About; Alan Parrish is the son of wealthy shoe maker Samuel Parrish. But the life of a rich man's son changes when young Alan comes upon a new board game, he is transported into it while playing it. Twenty or so years later two orphaned children, Judy (Kristen Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) come upon the game and play it. Next thing they now, Alan pops out of the game twenty years older along with a lion and some monkeys. It is a race to win the game with Alan (Robin Williams), Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt), Judy, and Peter while trying to outrun stampedes and Van Pelt, the man hunter. The movie has what a movie should have. The interaction of some of then animals is sometimes scary, sometimes funny, and sometimes just strange. Robin Williams is good like always and supported by Dunst, Hunt, and Jonathan Hyde (Van Pelt). It's what some mite call a child thriller. What to classify it as is though but it was good. Jumanji. Starring: Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kristen Dunst, Bradley Pierce, and Jonathan Hyde. 3 out of 5 Stars. Probably not perfect, but very fun; Jumanji is a highly imaginative and very fun movie. The visuals are good, and the story is creative and exciting. The storyline consists of a man being sucked into a board game. 26 years later, two kids find the board game and set him free. However, the game board has already released a few dangers, and those dangers must be stopped. The only way to do that is to finish the board game, and the animals (or whatever else was released from the game) will be put back into the game. There is action and minor thrills, and the movie emerges as being a fun experience. It's kind of creative, and it's an excellent adventure film. Sure, it is a bit cliché'd and the monkeys look pretty corny, but don't let them distract you from the overall enjoyment of the movie. 6.5/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment. A breathless unforgettable adventure!; I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind... This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure. Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story. Great! 10 out of 10 from me! My favorite movie as a child; I first saw this movie when I was 8 or something and I loved it immediately. The idea that you could actually play a game that could have the consequences Jumanji had was awe-inspiring for a kid like me. When I saw it again on TV 2 or 3 years later I taped it and watched it over and over again. At one moment I would lay in my bed and play the movie second by second and word by word in my head. That's how obsessed I was with this film. The action made me want to study biology and major in zoology actually. But I didn't study biology, I am a film student now. And from a film student point of view this movie is, of course, nothing special. The effects aren't perfect, it's no quality film and certainly not Oscar worthy or anything. But from a personal point of view, it still amazes me. When I watch it again it takes me back to my childhood and the amazing visions I had back then of it actually happening in my school and such. For that sense of nostalgia and the memories I have for this movie, I give this a straight 10 out of 10. After all, it was my favorite movie as a child. Brings back a lot of memories. Still a good ride.; My Take: A terrific special effects-laden adventure. JUMANJI is among those films I strongly remember from my childhood. Along with JURASSIC PARK and its sequel, JUMANJI is among those films I enjoy watching multiple times just to see creatures wreck havoc on a crowded street, monsters crawl in from the dark and other bits of special effects extravaganza. I strongly remember the elephants and rhinos stampeding around the crowded streets, a giant man-eating flower with vine-like tentacles, those messy (and weakly done CGI) monkeys with antics borrowed from GREMLINS, the crocodile and the shot of the house breaking apart. What I didn't remember was how faulty the dramatic interludes were. Which is exactly the point. JUMANJI is a wildly entertaining special effects extravaganza that works much better that way. Director Joe Johnston, who revived old-fashioned pulp adventures with THE ROCKETEER and later made JURASSIC PARK III so much better than it might have been, is such an accomplished action director. JUMANJI is a terrific and highly entertaining, if sometimes perilous, family adventure, though it does make several rest stops for back-stories and a bit of drama which sacrifices the pacing. The movie opens with two kids in 1969 with two kids curiously playing the titular game board which eventually unleashes African bats in the fireplace and sucking in little Alan Parrish (then played by Adam Hann-Byrd) inside the game. Forward 26 years later, someone else has bought the old Parrish mansion and the two new kids (Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce) dig up the old board game in the dusty old attic and give the dice a little role, and all hell breaks loose in town. With a little help from an older Alan Parrish (now played by Robin Williams) and his now older best friend Sarah (delightfully played by Bonnie Hunt), they try to finish what they started, unleashing more special effects behemoth after another. That's just about the \"plot\" of JUMANJI, yet I can go on forever with its visual treats. While the CGI doesn't live up to today standards (not to mention the totally unconvincing CGI monkeys!), but some of them in particular (including the terrific sequences where elephants and rhinos rampage around town and inside the mansion living room) still are eye candy. And, courtesy of director Johnston, there are still well-orchestrated moments of excitement. Stars Hunt and co-star David Alan Grier as a cop having a bad day provide the laughs. Despite some dull moments, which have a very major thing to do with its weak writing department, JUMANJI is still an amiable piece of entertainment. Still worth a look, but you might have the options of fast-forwarding to the really good parts. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5. 5 + 5 : « addictive and fun as a real game » (tv); I saw a little bit long ago and it seemed dull then. This time, i start another play right from the start and i found it still dull : the young boy appears a bit dumb, his wealthy family not better \n",
       " And then, first comes teen Dunst and i'm really surprised how good she acted (as she never convinced me as Peter's girlfriend). Next, Robin gets in the movie getting out the game and the magic operates : i really like the way past, present and future merge, how the game expands to the big mansion into town. If the special effects looks very tired, the story is original, full of surprises and proves that a humble cast can do as fine as a multiple billion dollars one ! Robin proved one more time he was a never grown-up kid with a beautiful soul with kids and the key to childish fun ! So i had a great time with this small movie as it gives me all i ask to cinema : to find a way to leave (cautiously) my world behind !! Decent adventure; Well where do I begin. The Casting: I guess the casting was OK. Robin Williams does a decent job, same goes for Kirsten Dunst. I really love the Sara Whittle character, but I am unsure if its because of her written dialog, which I indeed love, or the acting of Bonnie Hunt. I don't know what role the policeman is supposed to play however. I mean he doesn't do anything really important and it seems like he is there just to tie up the loose ends. It is OK though, I would rather have this cop around than just having them loose the game some more, which I think would have been the other alternative. His supposed to be funny moments however is something the movie could've done without. The Story: I really enjoy the story! Its simple, not to serious and perfect for adventure. My problem with it is how the story about the characters end which is a bit counter dramatic. The moral of the story, whatever you perceive it to be, feels meaningless. Since everything just ends up a-okay for everyone. Some people have been complaining that you never get to know the origin of Jumanji or how it looks inside the game. I don't have that problem simply because it would take away all the mystery. The parts of the story I grow tired off is how they loose the game to often. I figure its to add suspense which works at times, but the movie overdoes it. Another thing that I don't really like is how Van Pelt, the hunter, has to buy a new modern rifle. I kind of liked the retro feeling to him, but that disappears when he has an enormous automatic black rifle with night-vision aim rather than his own old rifle. The effects: To be honest, what comes first in my book is acting and story. If you take the old batman movie the effects aren't at all impressive. But that don't stop them from being awesome. Same goes for this, sure the computer effects haven't aged well and the monkeys just look stupid. But it isn't that big a part of the movie. Maybe of the marketing but I've learned you have to take that part of the entertainment business with mountains of salt. I figure I got to much to say about the movie, there is a lot of stuff I haven't talked about, so I'll just stop here and sum my thoughts up. Its imaginative and adventurous with good acting and decent effects. The only part which stops me from giving it a 10 is the \"comic relief\" which is just stupid and unnecessary. A bit more adult sprinkled on this movie and it would be a lot better in my eyes. Still, a good movie! The end is near!; 'The end is near' was my best thought after an hour of Jumanji. The end of the movie that is. Despite a lot of good reviews of people I hardly know, this film is a first-class let-down. It is the somanieth movie in which Robin Williams comic qualities are abused. The story is about a game, Jumanji, that has come to life. After every move something terrible happens; a stampede or a giant spider attack. The game has to be finished to stop all terrible things happening. Of course Williams' comic talent and the special effects try to safe the movie but everything is overdone. By memory, I recall that the makers promised great special effects; they had used the same effects as Jurassic Park! Yes, they did, but they obviously only got the demo version of the package. Also, poor Kirsten Dunst, having the role of a nice young girl, is transformed is such a prig that all her good intentions fall into nothing. All in all, if you have to choose between watching this movie and cleaning up the house, please clean up your house starting with trashing the video of this movie. Good for children; beautiful film. As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is \"better\" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. A dark, mysterious, and entertaining childhood favorite of mine; Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good. review for jumanji.; This 1995 film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game 26 years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are 8+ as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than 8 and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark The jungle; This is an excellent movie for all ages. Congratulations to the cast, production, stunts and all the people. And now I want know what's happen in the jungle when Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) was there for 26 years. This should be a good adventure. Wish they had more Jumanji history; My only real complaint with Jumanji is where did this game come from? Who created it? I really wish they could have discovered more about the game's past, it's history. Then it would have made a little more sense. But I'm not saying I didn't like it. On the contrary, I do enjoy it very much, I think it's a cool buried treasure. The characters, the story, the effects all perfect. The cast does a great job in this movie and the concept of a strange magical board game works. I wish there was more monster animals. But the man eating plant and the giant spiders is enough to put it on my page. Robin Williams does great in this first monster movie, wish he do more. But that's just me. Anyway, in conclusion ladies and jelly spoons. This is an assume movie and you can do much worse then Jumanji. 8 STARS. An awesome movie...; This movie is great. The story is so interesting and unique. The cast do a great job of portraying their characters and the visual effects aren't bad for the mid-ninties. Some people say they don't like this movie, for whatever reason, but I think it's an enjoyable adventure that anyone would enjoy. This movie is about a board game. A very special board game. When two children play the game, everything that the their players do, happens to them. So when Alan's piece gets a card saying he has to wait in the jungle, he disappears, which nearly drives the young girl he was playing with mad. Twenty-six years later, two new kids play the game, and release Alan. Alan and the kids must get the other play to continue to game, otherwise they won't be free until it's completed. Best part of the movie: When Alan comes out of the game. Worst part of the movie: The spiders. Recommended for: Everyone. Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Amazing. Decent family entertainment; On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children. Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it. Fun little movie hidden in the back drawer; Movie plays. In comes zoo. Who's that laughing? Why it's you! Jumanji never made a big splash (though the PR engine tried its best) but it's a clever little fantasy about a magical board game that changes reality. The special effects are laughable and enjoyable at the same time, particularly the stampede, and altogether it's a fun jaunt. Surprisingly, considering that the rest of cast is mostly up-and-comers, Robin Williams doesn't dominate the film, but adds the right touch of insanity to the whole affair. But, like many Williams vehicles, there's a heavy \"let children be children\" component, as well as a domineering father figure who somehow just can't show his love for his child. Ignore all that, and just enjoy the game. 7 of 10 from me. The Disney movie that could have been; Hunt and Williams play the parts of shellshocked-delayed stress syndrome surviviors quite well. The story is entertaining and engrossing, with both elements of light and darkness. The effects-well, they DO look a bit unreal-and perhaps that is for the best-it adds a sense of unreality to the story -after all, these things come from a board-game universe! Even Van Pelt looks a bit CGI...and Bebe Nuewerth is a sweetie. An entertaining adventure movie; The thing that grabs people about this movie is the computer effects. They are supposed to be of a very high quality and very realistic. I must digress at this point because when I saw this movie recently I discovered that the effects were not as great as they are made out to be. In fact, the lion looked quite out of proportion and the monkeys looked quite fake. I think that they pushed themselves to a point where they could not do any better. Even though some of the effects were quite irritating, I did enjoy Jumanji. It is an adventure movie with everything, a stampede, deadly insects, lions, floods, earthquakes, and even a psychotic hunter with a very big gun. What makes this adventure movie different is that it is not set in the middle of Africa but rather in a quiet New England town, that is quiet until all of these things are unleashed upon it. The film begins in 1969 where little Alan Parrish is running away from bullies. He goes to his father's factory and notices a chest in one of the construction sites. Opening the chest he finds the game Jumanji. He takes it back home and plays it with his friend at which he promptly disappears. Fifteen years later, another two children find the game and decide to play it and release poor Alan Parrish. Having done that they realise that they must finished the game and revert everything back to normal. The interesting thing that I see in this movie is the difference in the time between 1969 and 1995. In 1969 everything is nice and everybody is friendly, with the exception of the bullies. Business is booming and the town is lovely and clean. This changes in 1995 for when Alan walks through the town we see a very different place. The once clean town park is now a squat for beggars, most of the shops have closed down and the Parish Shoe company has been abandoned. Alan Parrish spends 16 years in a jungle to emerge in a world that has completely changed. As is typical of Hollywood, everything reverts back to its original form at the end, which deludes us with the idea that we can return the world to the good old days. This is something that we cannot do. The pleasant memories of our past will always remain there, and as is seen in Jumaji, not everything about the past is all that pleasant. We can look forward to a time when everything is restored, but this restoration goes back to the time of the Garden of Eden. The perfect world of Eden will be restored, rather than our pleasant childhood memories. I still like this movie though. Robin Williams is not one of my most favourite actors, but he does not turn me off as actors such as Van Damme do. Rather, he is reasonable. It is not him that attracts me to the movie, but rather the story. The story is an adventure and it is what you get. Jumaji basically delivers what it promises. Very enjoyable fantasy adventure.; Jumanji starts in 1969 in New Hampshire in New England where a young boy named Alan Parish (Adam Hann-Byrdd) & his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) starts playing a strange board game called Jumaji that Alan found buried in the ground earlier, Jumanji turns out to be magical & Alan is sucked into the board game while Sarah runs off. Twenty six years later & it's 1995 & Alan's old house has been empty for years until now, until young brother & sister Judy (Kirsten Dunst) & Peter (Bradley Pierce) move in with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), the two youngsters find the Jumanji game & start playing it themselves as all manner of creatures & climate events begin to appear as does Alan (Robin Williams) who has spent the last twenty six years trapped inside Jumanji & is now an adult. The only way to reverse the effects of Jumanji is to finish the game so with a now adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) the four players must battle whatever Jumanji throw's at them including Lions, Monsoon's, giant Spider's & a stampede... Girected by former special effects man Joe Johnston this oddball fantasy adventure is actually pretty good but there are one or two things that ultimately drag it down to merely a very good film rather than a great film in my opinion. Based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsberg the film is apparently quite different & the two main character's here Alan & Sarah don't even appear in the book, Jumanji is a hard film to categorise as it mixes various ideas & themes like a bad childhood, finding redemption, standing up to your fears, fantasy, sci-fi, horror & comedy. At 100 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace, once it gets going the situation just keeps getting worse & worse as all the chaos & mayhem escalates beyond anyone's control with all sorts of animals running around & the theme of facing your fears is an ever present one. I am not sure there is another film quite like Jumanji & to find something so original & different in a mainstream film is unusual but the CGI effects scenes, the lack of character depth, the refusal to do anything with the plot other than destroy a house & an ultra happy ending which goes on forever that gives every character in the film the best most happy ending is pure Hollywood that was not needed & a slightly darker ending in keeping with the slightly darker tone of the film overall would have been much better. To be honest apart from great set-pieces & the basic concept there's really not that much to Jumanji at all, it's rather shallow & it's attempts at depth are pure heavy handed Hollywood cliché but it's fun & very entertaining while it lasts, just a shame about the last ten minutes really. Jumanji was made just as the CGI computer graphic revolution was taking off back in the mid 90's but the effects do hold up rather well actually, from huge plants to an impressive stampede of Rhino's & Elephant's through a house to a huge Lion with the mischievous Monkey's probably the only real weak effect. As a fairly light hearted fantasy adventure with some darker overtones there's a few amusing moments including a bemused policeman who's car is slowly & systematically trashed & as a whole the film delights in needless destruction & mayhem which is no bad thing. There are some laughs & a few scares as well & I could definitely see Jumanji appealing to both older & younger audiences. With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 this had a very healthy amount spent on it with most going towards the effects I would have thought. Filmed in New Hampshire & British Columbia in Canada. Despite being known as a manic performer Robin Williams is pretty restrained here & his brand of psychical comedy isn't used much, Kirsten Dunst is one of the few child stars to go on & have a successful adult career while the acting generally is pretty good. Jumanji is a unique fantasy adventure that I think would appeal to both children & adults, my only real problem is the sweeter than sweet happier than happy ending which is pure sentimental Hollywood at it's worst. With an ending more in keeping with the rest of the film Jumanji might have got a seven from but as it is it gets a six, good but not great. Followed by Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005) which was shot under the title Jumanji 2. Jumanji; I think that kids would like this movie better then grownups. I loved this movie but my mom thinks the plot is to low. The movie is based on the book Jumanji and is a lot more deeper then the book. My bother thought that the movie was corny and the special effects were so bad they were funny but what does he know? OK maybe the effects were bad but whatever. I mean the movie was made along time ago so give them a break. I thought the movie was really good and the acting was great. Its the kind of movie that if you like it you watch it again and again and again. When I was sick I saw it 4 times and I still thought it was good. All and all I would give this movie a 9. I think that kids would like to see it. One word - fun! **mild spoilers**; B   \"Jumanji\" is, simply put, a fun, family-oriented action/adventure film.  From the killer plants to the CGI stampede and monkeys, to character actor Jonathan Hyde's (\"The Mummy\", \"Titanic\", \"Anaconda\") dual role as Alan Parrish's (Adam Hann-Bird/Robin Williams) father, and the ruthless man hunter Van Pelt, this is a gung-ho \"Indiana Jones\"-type film for kids. The plot is basically two sets of kids who discover a board game that makes the events that occur in them (killer mosquitoes, monkeys, etc.) come true.  Robin Williams plays Alan Parrish, a boy who got trapped in the game as a kid, with Bonnie Hunt as the girl who was with him and later, his love interest.  Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce play the two kids from 1995. I'll take my previous statement back - the film is more slapstick than \"Indiana Jones\".  A lot of the humor is physical or sight gags - eg. the monkeys riding a motorcycle with a pistol, which IS pretty damn funny, and the rows of supplies knocking over paint cans that bury Van Pelt. The film is suspenseful, well-produced, and has good special effects.  No, I'll take it back.  The monkeys and the lion look really fake (the stampede works since it would be hard to film a real one), but otherwise, they're okay. Aside from the fake-looking animals and the way-too-drawn-out ending, \"Jumanji\" is superb. Seven stars. Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a 10/10. Jumanji is fun!; What a great movie and a clever concept! A board game that sucks you into it, and must be finished by the originals who played the game. I remember seeing Jumanji in the movie theatre when it first came out, and this past weekend had the opportunity to rewatch it (thank you resale DVDs!) Starring Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, the action is fast paced and easy to follow. No swearing in this movie makes it appropriate for all ages, though little ones might be frightened by the rampaging animals. There is nothing Disneylike in their qualities. Still, the story of sticking together and teamwork prevail throughout the entire film. Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Greier are great in their supporting roles. Bonnie Hunt gets some of the best lines in the film with regards to cheating and a downtown sale. An early Kirstin Dunst is also great. If you have never seen Jumanji, I encourage you check it out. It's fun and you always wonder what the game is going to come up with next. LOVE THIS MOVIE!; Last night, May 2,2003  this movie was on again........no matter what other show we might be browsing at the time, we invariably start watching Jumanji,,,,,,we enjoy the hilarity and antics of all the characters,  it's done for shear  fun and entertainment, and we don't care if the special effects may be outdated,  we still consider it one of the best! So there! :-) Two  Happy Fishes  from oHIo Early CGI Makes the Monkeys Look Fake! Otherwise It's Amazing!; An enchanted board game breaks into the real world and the only way out of it is to finish the game! The monkeys look \"washed-out\" and so do some of the wild zoo animals; which is why most of the rest of the EFX are mechanical or use backdrops and mattes. Otherwise a very strong 10 would be my vote, as the casting works and the plot shows lots of imagination and flair. With a \"sly wink\" to \"Peter Pan\", Alan's father plays both his dad and Van Pelt the Hunter. My two favorite scenes are when the house gets folded in half and eaten by the monstrous plant, and when everything swirls backwards into the gameboard. I also love it when the house goes \"wild\" and turns into a swamp complete with nasty alligators. I do not like the scene where the little boy turns into a monkey with a tail. Young children may find it disturbing like the donkey transformation in \"Pinocchio\". \"Jumanji\" is suspenseful and scary but no one actually dies in the film. Therefore, it's much more enjoyable when viewed again. The only one who seemed to hate it was Roger Ebert, but it's only too scary for pre-schoolers. Most \"users\" love it! What \"scares\" me the most in this film: the bats, insects, spiders, alligators, and The Hunter. The sequel will not have the charisma of the late and great Robin Williams. I still miss him. He was a comic genius. If there was a market for it, I would like it to be re-imagined with better graphics like the old \"Star Trek TOS\" reissue. Entertaining family/adventure/fantasy; Released in 1995, \"Jumanji\" is fun movie about a mystical board game from the 1800s, which is found in 1969 leading to the mysterious disappearance of a rich boy. The game is discovered again in 1995 by two orphans (Jonathan Hyde and Kirsten Dunst) who play the game and bring back the lost boy now an adult (Robin Williams). The only way they can stop the havoc the game causes is to finish it. Bonnie Hunt, David Alan Grier and Bebe Neuwirth are also on hand. Patricia Clarkson has a small role. \"Jumanji\" is a great example of the way youth adventures should be done. It's entertaining from beginning to end for children, teens and adults. If you've lost sight of your inner-kid give \"Jumanji\" a try. What makes it worthwhile for adults, besides simply being fun, is that it contains compelling themes and everything ties-up for a moving climax. Plus Bebe Neuwrith looks great (she played Frasier's psychologist babe on Cheers). The movie runs 104 minutes and was shot in Maine, New Hampshire and the Vancouver, British Columbia, area. GRADE: B+ Imaginative (spoiler); This is probably one of the most imaginative movies I have seen in a while. I mean, it has an entire back story, as we can see in the beginning, when those two kids are trying to get rid of the game. Then it goes to 1969, when Alan finds the game, he and Sarah start playing, and he gets sucked into Jumanji. Then, throughout the rest of the movie, Alan comes out of the jungle and he, Sarah, Judy, and Peter continue playing the game and unleashing all these dangerous animals (and Van Pelt) and the monsoon and killer plants into the city. And at the end, those kids in Japan find the game. Very well thought out. Certainly worth a look. Fun!; I give this movie a ten on ten. I may be biased as I watched this movie when I was ten and whenever I watch it, it brings back fond memories of lazing around and watching movies during my summer vacations. But I am surprised that the overall rating for this movie is 6.5 (when I write this review), I expected it to be at least 7. This really is a fun movie to watch with some hilarious scenes. The monkey bike riding scene stands out it particular. The special effects looked good when I was young but now the fake animals are not very impressive. Jurassic Park was made before this movie and had much better special effects. Robin Williams does seem too old to play a 35 year old Alan Parish but he is a brilliant actor and you do not mind accepting him as Alan. Bonnie Hunt does a good job too as the paranoid Sarah Whittle. The kids do a great job too, especially Bradley Pierce; look out for the scene where he is searching for an axe. And David Grier is brilliant as the bumbling sheriff Carl Bentley. I suggest you watch this movie with your family on a weekend. Its worth it! My first crush on  Kirstin Dunst...; When this movie came out during the holiday season in 1995, I enjoyed it very much seeing it in SDDS and 35mm at the Sony in Wayne with my family and loved the effects. I even had the VHS for awhile. This is a good movie to test your surround sound system to the limits. The book was good, and the movie is better, but the TV show sucked. With the upcoming reboot replacing the board game with a video game coming out later this year, it's time to revisit this legendary Robin Williams family classic for the first time. An entertaining family film.; This film talks about a board game set in the inhospitable jungles of Indonesia that recreates magically the dangers in the board, for horror of the players involved. Directed by Joe Johnston, the film has a script by a team led by Jonathan Hensleigh. The main protagonist is Robin Williams, assisted by the young Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Yes, the theme of the movie would make a great horror film but, in this case, we have a comedy. And Robin Williams was definitely the \"Mr. comedy\". Any comic role fit him like a glove and this film was no exception. Although his character have some psychological depth, because of the trauma of being alone in the jungle for decades, it only serves to accentuate the humorous slant of what he says and does. The script is interesting, simple and very imaginative. The story works, entertains and holds the audience. The film scares a bit in certain scenes, but never in an excessive dose for children. The scenarios are good and the special, visual and sound effects are excellent. Some creatures in the film are clearly false and have a funny look. The soundtrack is regular, not bringing surprises, but doing their part without blemish. This film was made to entertain the audience, in particular the families, and does it very well.  \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      OLDER, HORNIER AND STILL FRUSTRATED IN MINNESOTA;  `Grumpier Old Men' is a film that is a sequel to `Grumpy Old Men.' Reprising their original roles are Jack Lemmon as John Gustafson, Walter Matthau as Max Goldman, Ann Margaret as Ariel, Burgess Meredith as John's father, Kevin Pollock and Darryl Hannah as the children of Max and John. They are still next-door neighbors, only now the feud has subsided. Their children are living across the street in Ariel's house.  The marriage of their children is on the horizon. The setting for this film is summer and fall in Minnesota.  Fishing is still the main sport where `Catfish Hunter' is still the elusive prize.  The bait shop on the lake has been closed since Chuck passed away.  It is now under new management.  John and Max are anxiously waiting the reopening.  To their surprise, it is not being reopened as a bait shop, but a ristorante (restaurant).  Here enters Sophia Loren as the new proprietress Maria Sophia Calotti Ragetti.  Ann Guilbert who plays her mother joins her.  When Max and John find out the new plans for their favorite bait shop, they set out to undermine her plans for a grand opening.  A series of misunderstandings set off a domino effect that touches everyone's lives.  New loves are found and an old feud is rekindled. All of the same emotions that were in the previous film are in this film. There is laughter, sadness, anger and happiness.  Catfish Hunter makes his film debut, which, in essence, puts a `face' with a name.  His film appearance pays credence to the fact that he is a `real' fish and not just a myth.   The acting in this film is superb both by human and non-human.  Cute sequel that works; Fun story of two older men who never quite outgrew boyhood, and the ladies they love. What a treat to see two master actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, working with silly material and enjoying every minute of it. The lady loves, Ann Margret and the ever-sexy and dazzling Sophia Loren, do equally well with a lightweight, sometimes over-the-top script. The principals are aided by a uniformly fine supporting cast, including Burgess Meredith as the Lemmon character's outrageously lecherous dad, and Ann Morgan Guilbert as Sophia's feisty mama. The older players' interaction is a delight. My only quibble with this film is the fact that Meredith's character dies without getting married like everyone else. Why? I wondered whether Meredith had perhaps expired during filming, but, according to Wikipedia, the actor lived a whole two years following this movie's release! The original film, \"Grumpy Old Men,\" takes place during a picturesque Minnesota winter, with snow used to charming effect. The follow-up capitalizes on a Midwestern summer. Like apples and oranges, both productions satisfy. More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in 1995, 2 years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie 8 out of 10. A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances...; A sequel to the thoroughly enjoyable Grumpy Old Men, 'Grumpier Old Men' is A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances. The sequel has the spirit of its prequel & the amazing cast, led by the impeccable talents of the Late/Great Jack Lemmon & the Late/Great Walter Matthau, are in full form! 'Grumpier Old Men' Synopsis: John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. 'Grumpier Old Men' works well as a romantic-comedy, as it has moments of humour & subtle romance. I loved the prequel & I must say, the sequel doesn't fail to deliver. The film has sustained its energy & wit, that one would expect from it. Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is entertaining, although initially the pace is slightly slow. Howard Deutch's Direction is top-class. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is good. Editing also is ably done. Performance-Wise: Lemmon & Matthau shine all through. Its their sheer on-screen chemistry, that alone is worth watching the entire film. Sophia Loren is top-notch. Ann-Margret is impressive. Kevin Pollak & Daryl Hannah leave a mark. Late/Great Burgess Meredith is memorable in his part. On the whole, 'Grumpier Old Men' is a smooth, relaxing watch. Oh, How The Mighty Have Fallen...; GRUMPY OLD MEN (3 outta 5 stars) GRUMPIER OLD MEN (2 outta 5 stars) I dunno why I even bothered to watch the second one. Oh, I guess because it was on cable TV shown as a double bill with the original \"Grumpy Old Men\". I liked the original when I first saw it. It was not the best work by the Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau team... but it had its moments... these two actors could probably read pages from the phone book to each other and still make it funny. Unfortunately, the sequel has even FEWER of those moments. Still, I maintain that no movie with either Lemmon OR Matthau in it can be *totally* worthless. This is probably as close as they ever got, though. (Bear in mind that I have not yet seen their last movie together, \"The Odd Couple II\".) Practically the same plot as the first movie... Lemmon and Matthau play lifelong acquaintances and next door neighbors who are constantly bickering about fish and/or women. Burgess Meredith plays Lemmon's FATHER... and if you find old people talking dirty hilarious then you'll probably love his scenes (especially in the closing credits outtakes). Ann Margaret and Sophia Loren play the women in the grumpy guys' lives... hard to imagine that women as attractive as they still are would want anything to do with these two old dorks but, hey... I guess pickings are slim after 65. very funny.; This film has some of the funniest lines and it's a great comedy. One would probably think, even I, thought that this would probably happen between two older men who fight about the obvious: women, fish and each other. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are a perfect pair. Even though it's a comedy, the romance in it is on the clean side. Nothing too distasteful and the comic relief is still included into the romance, which gives it a continuous comic flow. Even though there is a serious part of the film where John's father passes away, after that scene the film is back to the comic feel, which is nice because there's no dwelling on the sad/serious scene. Nonetheless, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh hard. Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Snoozing sequel with the leads in need of some No-Doz; Woeful, disappointing sequel to 1993's hit \"Grumpy Old Men\" is more retread than follow-up. The two crotchety neighbors--Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--bicker over their children (who will soon be making the sparring oldsters in-laws!) and, of course, who has the better fishing skills. They stop trading insults long enough for Matthau to begin irritating a new woman in town, a fiery Italian who has just opened her own restaurant. Sitcom humor with a sometimes-raunchy twist that is no longer fresh. Almost worth-seeing for Sophia Loren's funny, lively performance, but everyone else looks a little sleepy. Ann-Margret (who married Lemmon's character at the end of the original) must've dropped in for a day and a half to complete her work. As the youthful couple, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah are also under-used. ** from **** The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Back For More!; CONTAINS SPOILERS John Gustafson and Max Goldman are back in their first adventure since their last. It's six months later and they're still fishing. All the snow has melted and the neighborhood looks very different. The boys are out to catch a giant legendary fish they've heard tell about.          These men would soon discover big changes happening. Like, their friend Chuck, who died in the last adventure, had operated the bait shop. Ever since his demise, it's been empty, but some people have come with plans to turn it into a ristorante (restaurant). They are: Mama Regetti and daughter Maria. John and Max don't want that to happen so they pull numerous pranks on the Regettis but they still won't leave.         Jacob Goldman and Melanie Gustafson contemplate matrimony. But have their doubts when their fathers insist on planning the event. But when the kids decide the wedding is off, John and Max are back at it. Pulling all sorts of foolish pranks on one another. Max steals John's outboard motor, John wrecks Max's fish net and has his cat scratch up Max's car seats, but Max sends a big dog through John's house. Ariel decides to leave for a while. John was in a real pickle. He tried asking his father for advice, but he had passed away; Max goes on a date with Maria and they decide they like one another.        Pretty soon, it's a wedding day. En route to the church, Max and John decide to fish for the giant musket they're so fond of. They catch it, but John says they must leave it in the lake out of respect for his father, so they do and rush to church. It looks like the wedding of Jacob and Melanie, but it isn't. They eloped. It's the wedding of Max and Maria. John planted Max's dog in the limo as they drive off.        Was this as good as the first? Sure. I'm sorry to say that the three main stars, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Burgess Meredith are no longer with us. Meredith died in 1998, Matthau in 2000 and Lemmon in 2001, which is real sad. So it's guarenteed there will never be an Even Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple III. They were really funny men. Why do the good ones always gotta die? But anyway, if you're a fan of these men and you enjoyed the first one, then I recommend Grumpier Old Men! - Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. 7/10 stars. 1/10; this movie sucked! I hate it! It's so boring! The acting is so bad! Why does Sophia Loren's italian character talk english to her italian mother when they're alone? The script is so bad! It's so corny! Max and John fighting with the fishing things is so silly! This movie was never funny! It was painful to watch, i'm telling you! Avoid it! Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT 7 out of 10 Delightful acting and script but silly scenes...; Always delighting in Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, warmed by their aging and childish pranks, I enjoyed this film which is filled with delightful acting and fun script.It suffers, however,  from more than a few silly scenes. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10 A sequel that's equal to the original comedy; The first go round was such a hit, that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau got together for this sequel to the 1993 smash hit, \"Grumpy Old Men.\" And \"Grumpier Old Men\" is every bit as good as the first film. It has some new characters and the scene changes from winter to summer, then winter and spring. Most reviewers don't talk about the surprise of the wedding in the first film. And I won't do that for that film or this one. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) team up for a time in the movie to plan the wedding of their daughter and son, Melanie and Jacob (played by Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak). And, later, to try to thwart the conversion of their bait shop into an Italian restaurant. Sophia Loren is the added ingredient for much humor as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti. She's a cousin of \"Spaghetti\" Ragetti, whom John and Max know. Her mother is in the picture, Mama Ragetti, played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. And, grandpa Gustafson is back, with Burgess Meredith now a couple years older. He tells son, John, as they sit by the lake drinking beer, that he sometimes thinks God has forgotten about him. The hijinks and capers in this film include some hilarious pranks the two friendly enemies pull on the Ragettis. As with the original film, this one supposedly takes place in Wabasha, Minnesota. While it is a real town on the Mississippi River border with Wisconsin, the filming for this and the earlier movie was done in a number of places around that area of southeastern Minnesota. So, anyone going to Wabasha won't find the fishing lake, the town overlook or some other scenes shown in these films. With the 10 films they made together  especially the nine comedies, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have delighted audiences for decades. May they outlive Catfish Hunter and continue amuse people for decades to come. Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5. Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Loren is still hot; Grumpy old men was an OK comedy with a nice performance by Ann-Margret, but otherwise forgettable. This film, on the other hand, has some real comic touches that actually also have something to say about the aging process - and life really doesn't end until it ends. But first the bad news: Daryl Hannah. I've liked her in other films, but she is so flat in this, she's a distraction. She doesn't have the feel for these characters, not even her own, and so doesn't quite fit. She's not even credible as the mother of the young girl who is so important in her relationship to great=grand-dad Burgess Meredith. There must have been some plot device they could have come up with to leave her out of the picture altogether; oh, well. Now the really good news: Sophia Loren. I admit I have always had a crush on her since I saw Houseboat as a kid; and when I saw the shower scene in Arabesque, i couldn't sleep for a week. Her performance here is splendid (romantic comedy is one of her strengths, after all), but the really really good news is that she was past sixty when she made this film, and she looks hot enough to burn a young man's fingers! Really - if I'd been Walter Matthau in that bar scene, I'd have gone out with a heart-attack right there - and smiling. With an adequate script, and such superb actors, Deutsch wisely lets the formula roll on without interference. Consequently, whatever the short-comings there's plenty to remember fondly from this film. Oh, and don't miss the blooper-reel that runs under the final credits - Matthau and Meredith are having a grand old time. Oh, and Sophia Loren is still hot. A vibrant sequel that's still underwhelming; I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They seem to work perfectly together, and with a better script, this movie could be gold. We are taken back to Minnesota to re-visit the old grumps who now have to plan a wedding for their very plain and very boring children. There's a reason Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah have never had substantial film careers- they're very uninteresting actors. But I digress. If \"Grumpy Old Men\" built up it's laughs, \"Grumpier Old Men\" topples them down. The best moments of both films are when Lemmon and Matthau trade vicious insults at one another, and also play pranks on each other. But when this is taken away, we're suffering every old cliché in the book, including Walter's tiresome 'Wholey Moley' line which is used so much, it could be taken into context for a Shot Party (take a shot every time Matthau 'Wholey Moley''s himself). The other problem with this series is the fact that gorgeous women fall for these two farts. Roger Ebert made a very valid point in his review for this film- first Ann-Margaret moves into the neighborhood and marries Jack Lemmon. Now the even more gorgeous Sophia Loren has set her sights on the incredibly unattractive Matthau. And why? For concepts in the plot. There's no reason a woman as beautiful and intelligent as Loren would fall for the dull and disgusting figure Matthau is. I know this is a comedy, but come on now! All in all this sequel is peppier and a little more fun then the original, but both movies suffer from overblown dramatic passages that are not needed. We want to see the old guys go at it, not Kevin Pollack and Darryl Hannah. I laughed a lot at this movie- mostly at the incredibly underrated Bergis Meredith as the foul-mouthed Grandpa. Since all three main actors have passed, we'll never see them again. At least Margaret and Loren are still alive and kicking. I'd love to see their movie: \"Grumpy Old Widows\". Still having a good ol' time!; I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men back to back, so I could see both instead of my normal rent one sequel at a time ordeal. I just finished Grumpier Old Men this morning and was expecting a modest sequel, but it turned into a great sequel, pretty much to the point where I enjoyed Grumpier Old Men to Grumpy Old Men. Despite the fact that they use some old jokes, this was a fun plot and I thought the guys have gotten even funnier, including John's father, he's a little dirty, but so much fun to laugh at. John and Max are now best friends again and couldn't be happier with each other, their son and daughter are about to get hitched, and they are overwhelming with the wedding plans. Max is starting to get lonely though, since Chuck has passed on, the bait shop is given to two older Italian women, one lady, Maria, starts a little feud with Max wanting to turn the bait shop into a restaurant. But their anger turns into a hidden passion and they end up falling head over heals for each other, but Maria has some hidden skeletons in her closet. Grumpier Old Men is proof that you are never too old to fall in love or have your heart broken again. It was so sweet seeing Max fall in love with Maria, I loved their passion for each other, it was so fun to watch. John's father and Maria's mother were just so awesome and funny, they had such great chemistry! I would highly recommend Grumpier Old Men, it's a great comedy that once again touches your heart and tickles your funny bone. 8/10 It has it's moments; Howard Deutch decided he wanted to cash in on the success of Grumpy Old Men and it worked. The only problem to the sequel is that some of the cast seem to be a bit bored by the proceedings. The one liners are enough to make you drop your popcorn. Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon are a joy to watch as they continue to find ways to drive each other over the edge into insanity. And yet Deutch calms that insanity by giving us a quick glimpse into just how much these two men mean to each other when Jack's dad played by Burgess Meredith dies. Lemmon and Mathau are still at the top of their game in this film. In this film the Ann Margaret character is suppose to be the rock, the sound of reason, the calm in the midst of the storm. You believe she is until she has the insanity thrust upon her and is forced to react. For the most part Ann Margaret as well as Daryl Hannah seem bored throughout the entire film. Kevin Pollack is just as good in this sequel as in the original. Burgess Meredith is the scene stealer, he manages with dead pan accuracy to deliver some of the best one liners in the film. Ann Morgan Guilbert manages to match Burgess with her ability to respond to his one liners with shock and outrage befitting her character. And then you come to Sophia. Sophia is in her comfort zone here. Sophia is comfortable with the slapstick comedy and relishes it, she's in the movie, she's not walking through it. She's absolutely stunning to watch but at the same time she adds to the moment. She's as glamorous as ever but it doesn't get in the way. All in all a good follow up to the original. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. charming and funny light romantic comedy; It may be just me but I found Grumpier Old Men way way better than Grumpy Old Men. I laughed more and got involved in the plot much more. That it is totally 100% predictable every step of the way is only one of its charms... its how you get there where the fun is. And these actors turn in surprisingly memorable performances for such a slight film. I thought Sophia Loren turned in one of her most charming and funny performances, as did everyone else. The story was just more interesting and three dimensional than the first film and flowed more organically. The story line is simple ancient classic romantic comedy that these veterans had done so many times, it seemed for them like doing a well-known dance. The fun is not in surprises but in going through the old steps with joy. The actors move through their paces with simplicity and enthusiasm and the film actually captures very well the effects of love. The whole film hangs together and works in a way that, for me, the first one didn't. It gets airborne. It deserves a higher ranking than my seven except the story is a little too well-worn. It also allows the two protagonists to get a little more real with each other. Even the three charismatic animal actors get caught up in the spirit of fun. One thing about the film that gave me trouble was that all four women being courted in the film are talented, accomplished, strong and magnificent while all four of the men are hamstrung. I found it mysterious that these women, dropped by some miracle into this tiny town, would be so strongly attracted. funny funny; I, too, found the film very funny and until reading about it here couldn't remember who played the other woman with Burgess Meredith at the end of the film, the scene that made the whole film complete.  Without giving away what happened at the end of the film, the other woman was that gorgeous elder lady of many great films - Sophia Loren.  What a delicious surprise!  Good also for any old grumpy man! the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... not much fun; Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still combative while maintaining their truce. John is married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) now and his father (Burgess Meredith) is still spry. Everybody is chasing after the big fish Catfish Hunter. Meanwhile, their children Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are planning to get married. Newcomer Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in Wabasha to buy the bait shop and turn it into an Italian restaurant. It's a continuation that's missing much of the fun. It is contrived. It's great to see these great actors working together but that's all I got out of it. I found very few laughs. after you have seen the first there is no point seeing this one; After the fun of watching Lemmon and Matthau act like kids for less than 2 hours (i.e. from the first movie) I was satisfied, but then due to the success of the first movie the producers decided to give it another twirl, this time the story had the two starting off as friends thanks to the incidents that happened in the ending of the first film, but then some really really idiotic stupid reason, they were at it again. The movie was not funny as it was like a replay of the first, same pranks, similar plot and screenplay made this movie a waste of time. After getting a mate for John, they (the producers) decided to get a mate for Max, with nothing to write home about but a lame script that just showed no finesse or true plan, just the producers hoping to bank on the success of the previous movie. The main disappointment in the movie for me was Sophia Loren; her acting was just too weak for me to understand that she is a star. Everybody else in the movie even Burgess Meredith (who had Alzheimer's disease and this was his last motion picture appearance) was impressive, at least that I can give them. The movie is directed this time by Howard Deutch, who later worked with the duo in 1998 for Odd Couple II, Deutch other movies also have not been well received like Getting Even with Dad (1994) and The Whole Ten Yards (2004), which are basically the reason why I will not bother seeing My Best Friend's Girl. The movie plot carries on 6 months after the incidents of the first, where both John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) were getting prepared for the wedding of their children. Then a new arrival in town a beautiful lady by the name of Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) came in to change things by turning the towns bait shop to a restaurant. John and Max join forces to try and run the new lady out of town, but the issues between John and Max's children marriage plan caused both to reignite their feud as both refused to believe that their child was at fault. Only the ladies are alive till today (February 2013), as both Lemmon and Matthau died like half a decade after this movie release. Grumpier Old Men was a box office success in its own part, but a huge critical disappointment, as the movie cost 10 million dollars less than its predecessor and made like a million more in the box office. After you have seen the first there is basically no point why you should bother seeing this one, because it will stand in my mind as one movie I credit as a waste of time and talent. www.lagsreviews.com Funnier than the first!; This movie is downright hilarious with tons of good one-liners. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (may they both rest in peace) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max & John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says \"Holy moly\" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor! As Good As The Original; Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\". I don't agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love \"Buddy Buddy\" and \"The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile. Pretty Dang Funny; John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention. We often expect sequels to be weaker than the original. But sometimes we may be pleasantly surprised. In this sequel, the \"grumpy old men\" are still up to their old tricks, going after each other and teaming up to close down a restaurant. Some of it may be a bit far-fetched (in real life, a store owner would get the cops involved) but it's good fun. Sadly, the film has the distinction of being Burgess Meredith's final film. On the plus side, he really goes out with a bang. His acting and delivery of witty lines is top notch, and the film does a great job of hiding his Alzheimer's. You can really feel the talent in his character. Grumpy, but not funny; What, I wonder, does the legendary Billy Wilder think of this film starring Lemmon and Matthau, the great team he so memorably paired in 1966's \"The Fortune Cookie\"?  Wilder's film is a dark, cynical satire, and was the first of what is now seven films starring the pair.  Seven films, but only two of them--\"The Fortune Cookie\" and \"The Odd Couple\"--are genuinely funny efforts showcasing these actors' combined talents.  \"Grumpy Old Men\" was mildly amusing due less to the script than to the welcome return of Lemmon and Matthau who hadn't been on screen together in 12 years.  The unexpected box-office bonanza naturally inspired a sequel, but all this equally lucrative outing has in its favor is a brief monologue by Burgess Meredith who, as Lemmon's 95-year-old father, boasts of eating bacon and smoking Camels while the \"experts\" who warned against such vices are taking a \"dirt nap.\"  Not even Lemmon and Matthau can enliven the script by Mark Steven Johnson this time around.  The curmudgeonly Matthau admitted he didn't lke the script for the first film but did it to work with Lemmon, and that the only reason he did the sequel is because the first film was a hit.  No doubt, \"Grumpiest Old Men,\" the inevitable sequel, will be just as dreary. If these pictures make big bucks, why tamper with the formula?  Why hire Billy Wilder to punch up the quality when the public seems content merely to see Lemmon and Matthau rather than see them at their best? Is it better than original?; Is this movie better than the original? Perhaps. It's probably funnier than the original. Walter Matthau's pick-up line is one of the funniest things of the movie. But is it better than the original? The original had more of the emotions of Lemmon and Matthau as they fought. This one has less feuding (but still has some of the old pranks) and more focus on the family / dating relationships of the old men. This movie is funny and definitely worth watching. You'll have to decide on your own if it's better than the original. Mini Ha Has In Minnesota; It's just possible that the intention was to shoot four Grumpy Old Men titles featuring the four seasons because after the Winter setting of the first one we are now in Summer though theoretically such a cycle should have begun with Spring and ended with Winter so maybe the cyclical thing was an afterthought. Whatever we have virtually the same cast doing virtually the same thing with one absentee and two replacements one of which, Anna Guilbert is actually a native of Minneapolis adding a touch of authenticity. If it was unrealistic that Ann Margaret - who, after all, was teaching English at university and would by definition have access to dozens of eligible males - would marry Jack Lemmon in the first film it is equally unrealistic that Sophia Loren would wed Walter Mattheau here other than for feelgood reasons. On the other hand it's probably churlish to nitpick in this way when the film is only intended to entertain. Which it does. As equally funny as the original, but with an Italian flair!!!!; This sequel to Grumpy Old Men is as funny as the original. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and the rest of the cast from the original movie reprise their roles. John and Max are still feuding, but the tension between them has softened. There are, however, some changes: Ariel and John are married and there's a new girl in town named Maria Ragetti. She's moved to Wabasha to open up an Italian restaurant at the former Chuck's Bait place. When the boys discover what Maria's intentions are, they hatch a scheme to ruin the grand opening of the restaurant and try to keep Chuck's business going, even though the inventory of the former business has been cleared out and the interior remodeled to look like an Italian restaurant. Max and Sophia meet, but there's a disagreement about what the place should be. Maria goes to the neighborhood bar to try and reason with Max, but to no avail. It seems as though Max and John have trouble saying goodbye to what is no longer there. The humor between Lemmon and Matthau's characters is still spiced up and is still able to put viewers in stitches. Then, Max and Maria get married, and the restaurant starts selling bait, as well. Great movie, great cast, great fun!! Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. 2/5 stars - John Ulmer \"Good Lemmon & Matthau Comedy Sequel!\"; Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Kevin Pollack, Daryl Hannah and Burgess Meredith star in this 1995 comedy sequel. This takes place about 6 months later where John (Lemmon) is now married to Ariel (Margret) and he and Max (Matthau) are sort of getting along. This time, Max finds romance when he meets Maria Ragetti (Loren), an Italian widow who moves into town and opens a restaurant. Jacob (Pollack) and Melanie (Hannah) are also engaged and things start to get a bit difficult for them which makes their dads feud with each other, but only temporarily. The late, Meredith (Rocky) also returns as John's father and this was his final film. This is a good sequel and like the first film, it provides laughs and a bit of heartfelt moments as well. I recommend this. The good, the bad, and the just plain miserable...again; It's not uncommon for a movie sequel to do little to the formula that made its predecessor so financially (and hopefully critically) successful. The old \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" method of filmmaking has been used in the Hangover, Home Alone, and Taken franchise to only modest success in terms of quality. However, in Grumpier Old Men, the sequel to the fine comedy Grumpy Old Men, handles the rehashed formula better than many film sequels do. While I'm getting to sound repetitive and out of descriptive words, this is largely because of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's chemistry together on-screen. From the moment they appear, it's almost impossible to believe the men's friendship in real life wasn't lifelong and consisted largely of playful torment, vulgarity, and several boys nights out. Had the film been a sequel with few returning cast members (say Lemmon and Matthau were substituted by two other actors), this sequel would've likely been a somber affair to view. In a way, I'm thankful the town of Wabasha Minnesota hasn't really changed much since our last outing, with the exception of John Gustafson (Jack Lemon) marrying Ariel (Ann-Margret) from the original film. In the meantime, John's dad still lives off a diet of beer, cigarettes, and bacon and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), John's cantankerous neighbor, still finds himself engaging in petty neighborhood battles with John about outwitting the other man. However, the big ordeal this time is not competing for a new neighbor's love but trying to save a local bait shop from becoming a \"restaurante\" for Italian cuisine. The restaurant is managed by Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren), a gorgeous but uncompromisingly strict woman who catches the eye of Max even as him and Jack plan to foil the restaurant's forthcoming prosperity. Other events (aka subplots) occurring in Wabasha are the wedding between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah), a plot which would later be used by the same director Howard Deutch in The Odd Couple II, also starring Lemmon and Matthau, along with John trying to get his father (Burgess Meredith in his final role, which was burdened by spouts with Alzheimer's and difficultly remembering lines, some female company as he gets older. One of Grumpier Old Men's immediate issues is that there is simply too much going on between plot-strands that involve marriage/romance troubles (I counted four including John's brief trouble with Ariel later in the movie) ad others that involve trying to sabotage the bait-shop-turned-restaurant. Grumpier Old Men may have too many new ideas for cutesy subplots, but it keeps the tone and feel of its predecessor alive and well. It still feels like Wabasha is the location of a sitcom with its oddball situations that seem to consistently bear hefty consequences for its residents, but its characters still feel like real people we've come to known and care about. Unsurprisingly, Lemmon and Matthau share unbelievable conversational beauty in the way they engage in simple discussions that seem to constantly end in uproariously funny bickering. Once you minimize your focus on that aspect in the film, you have just an average comedy that, while charming and pleasantly safe (a good and bad quality for this particular kind of picture), is just grateful to be buoyed by two very talented leading men. Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Sophia Loren, and Burgess Meredith. Directed by: Howard Deutch. Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life & Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau & Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman & John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a 7.4 out of 10 Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. Grumpier Old Men (1995) **1/2; More of the same for those who enjoyed the first film, nothing great but a decent time killer. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return in their twilight years as the ever-battling duo, but this time with the added attraction of Sophia Loren who still looks gorgeous at age 60. She winds up posing a threat to their favorite bait and tackle shop when she decides to take it over and turn it into an Italian restaurant. Since Lemmon's already got sexy Ann-Margret as his hot girlfriend, Sophia hits it off with old man Matthau (ah, the magic of movies), who does not look as good for his age (75). Burgess Meredith is better used in this one in his role as Lemmon's naughty old pop. **1/2 out of **** Who would have ever guessed that it's the same place?; For the most part, \"Grumpier Old Men\" is pretty silly. Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still at each other's throats when Italian immigrant Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in town and throws everything into flux. What actually struck me most about the movie was how different the town looked in this one from the original. Obviously, it was a different time of year, but maybe the different look was meant to show how everything might be changing in the town. Other than that, Ann-Margret returns as Ariel, and she's still as free-spirited and vivacious as she was in the original. Burgess Meredith - in his final role - is still the grandfather who can exercise absolute authority over the youngsters, although he now has the hots for Maria's mother (Ann Morgan Guilbert, aka Millie on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\"). Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah also reprise their roles from the original...ah, and there's that fish. All in all, a fairly interesting movie. Not any kind of masterpiece, but it showed that Lemmon and Matthau still had it. Grumpier Old Men Too Sedate *; While Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were an excellent team, they bombed in this film but good. What's so grumpy about Lemmon in this film? The prequel was much better. Ann Guilbert, as Sophia Loren's mother, is given little to do. Remember her as the grandmother to \"The Nanny?\" Sophia Loren, other than marrying Matthau, is also give nothing to do. Ditto for Ann-Margret, Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak, all of whom were so good in the original but are reduced to practically nothing here. I also resent Matthau, who shows off his part-Jewish heritage marrying in a church at the end. I found this to be offensive. Sorry, but that's the way I am-old fashioned. To all those criticize me for the last statement, how would you have felt if the Matthau-Loren nuptials had taken place in a synagogue? While I realize that this was a comedy, this still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. A non-religious setting would have been the only solution to this. great; This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa This is an all time great for all the family,, Walter John Matthau died in of a heart attack October 1, 1920  July 1, 2000 age 79 and Jack Lemmon died June 28 2001 god is with you ..one of the best film you will see r.i.p Melissa Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) Sweet and Sad; In this bright sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\" we find John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) at it again. The rivalry never stops. This time, they are bickering over their children's nuptials, almost causing a wedding not to occur. Sophia Loren co-stars as Maria in this foray into the land of 10,000 lakes as the new girl in town that Max has an eye for. At first, they both hate one another because she is turning his beloved tackle shop into a restaurant. Comedy ensues as Max and John both try to get the restaurant shut down and condemned. Eventually, as in the first film, love finds a way. However, sadness veils over as well when Burgess Meredith's character dies. Other than that, the film is very enjoyable. Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from 1995. The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe 8yrs old, and must have seen it over 100 x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it 15 minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. Great!; This is a rare sequel. Wait a minute, sequels aren't rare. Well, that's true, but a *good* sequel is rare. Most of the time, sequels aren't even in the same league as the originals. However, due to excellent writing, a superb cast and great direction, this film is every bit as enjoyable as Grumpy Old Men. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made several films together and they worked together extremely well. The gorgeous Ann Margaret reprises her role from the first film and is now Lemmon's wife. A new lady hits town and Matthau is very interested. This lovely creature is played by Sophia Loren, who is still stunningly beautiful. Burgess Meredith is great as Grandpa. The stellar cast ensures great acting. However, this film is also written such that there is literally a laugh nearly every minute. I found the film to be highly enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh. Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the 1st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. One of the best movies of 1995!; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter & Jack's previous films together. It was this film & the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max & John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down. forget the fussing; As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Good Laughs; Grumpier Old Men (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to Grumpy Old Men have Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau returning with more fights and foul language. This time out Lemmon is still happily married but Matthau is on the move and takes a special interest in an Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved to town. I think the most remarkable thing about this film is how well Loren looked. Even at 61 she's still a head turner and her comic timing isn't too bad either. I'm sure this film was only made because the first one made money but it doesn't really matter as no one should take this too serious as it's just a silly comedy meant to make you laugh. There are plenty of nice laughs here but I don't think it's as good as the original. This certainly isn't in the league as The Odd Couple but we do get a pretty good throwback to that film here as there's a scene where Lemmon has to spend the night with Matthau but can't put up with his dirty house. Ann-Margret returns but is pretty much wasted as is Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak. The perverted Burgess Meredith is back and steals the scene every time he's in it. Both Matthau and Lemmon are naturally very good and they easily slip back into their roles. It's priceless watching the two men work together even when the material isn't as strong as one would hope. Lemmon gets a special notice here due to a very touching scene with Meredith. Another problem is the direction, which has one of those \"made for TV\" feels to it. In the end this film could have and should have been a lot better but the cast make it worth watching. Sophia, twenty years later at 80, is still spectacular.; I saw a picture of Sophia on her eightieth birthday, demurely covering herself with a sheet and a heart-melting smile. All I could think of was the scene where she hitched up her bra and marched through the bar, and every man looked, and I do mean every man. I read later that she had \"improved\" the script for that. A reviewer in the SF Chronicle wrote later that she said she had had no \"touch- ups\", and if so then \"her genes need investigating.\" I remember her many films where her beauty was so natural that it was a wonder any man could concentrate on his lines. She never traded on it, but on her talent as an actress. Carlo Ponti was a lucky man: beauty without guile, talent without pretense. Italian pizza were like street food. When she heard we had so many pizza parlors, she thought we must be a poor country. Then she visited, and dined on American pizza. She reconsidered, gracefully and graciously.  \n",

really tickle my funny bone. I love to see miserable people hate a movie just because...well, they have nothing to better to do. Not saying this was the best movie I've ever seen. But I agree with others who say that Bassett and Levine are the ones to save this film from drowning with all the other horrible movies. I love Angela Bassett, I'm a huge fan of hers. The scene which depicts the morning after her husband leaves her for his secretary, which would've otherwise been too cliché for my taste had it not been for the way Bernie (Bassett) burned up that BMW! I mean that was classic. Sorry if any of you testosterone-fueled men out there will accuse me of man hating, but I love that scene and will watch it over and over again. Three cheers for Angie. And Devine's character, Gloria seems sort of weak and unable to stand up to even her teenage son, but I love how she bends a little and confesses how she feels to the late Gregory Hines' character. You'll notice Devine's Gloria and Bassett's Bernie are slightly juxtaposed but their chemistry is excellent. If you haven't seen it, check it out, if not for anything but the performance of these two gifted actors. Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" This film does Terry McMillan's writing no justice; This movie had great potential had it landed in the right directors hands (as seen with How Stella got Her Groove Back).  Many rough cuts, sloppy editing, and terrible lighting at times to name a few.  Casting was excellent with the exception of Whitney Houston who has the tendency to over-chew her scenes.  Though much of the book was not adapted to the film the strength and love amongst four friends was apparent.  It was the one thing that was not lost or left on the cutting room floor.  Good movie, better book. Waiting to Exhale (the movie) ***** (5 stars) Waiting to Exhale (the novel) ********** (ten stars) A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . Feel Good Movie; The acting in this film is phenomenal, especially on the part of Angela Bassett who always does an amazing job (see What's Love Got To Do With It). The inter-cuts work well where they are placed, much like all of the other shots, and keep the films pace and the viewer interested. I've read other user comments and I find their opinions to be completely biased and unwarranted. If you're watching this film looking for profound insight to life you will be disappointed. This film is an adaptation of Terry McMillan's critically acclaimed novel FOR BLACK FEMALES. Waiting to Exhale explores the lives of four female friends. Each woman makes mistakes and has to deal with those consequences. But it is through being there for one another that they overcome these problems and others. For me, most of the negative user comments are from people who the film was not made for, that are only analyzing the film from the story. There is more to a film than it's narrative and when base your full opinion on that alone you are missing out. Plus, for me, it's just flat-out annoying when people who are completely not the target audience bash a film. Note: this is not to say that art cannot breach color, age or sex barriers. But be let's be realistic for a moment. If say, a heterosexual, black, 21 year old female studying Art was asking you for a good movie suggestion for a Friday night...Would you suggest The Dukes Of Hazard? I think not. Not unless you were joking. Sticky; There was nothing in the movie that made me excited. The message did not come through,  if there was one. Perhaps it is to convey the idea that men are useless,  or that relations are complicated because women make it complicated. If a comedy,  I did not laugh.  If a drama,  I did not find it dramatic. It was like drinking a cup of coffee presented to you with way too much sugar. Whitney ruined the great potential; Angela Basset was good as expected, but Whitney has no Range as an actress. The screenplay also neglected to portray, on film, the greatness of this novel.  Instead of promoting sisterhood, they emphasized the canine-qualities of men.  Read the book; rent Soul Food instead! Excellent for the broken heart...; Perhaps the reason they call this movie a chick flick, is because that's exactly who it's aimed at. Women. I don't see this as a man bashing movie, but more as a \"how do you deal?\" type of movie. It covers every situation: The unworthy co-worker, The drug-addict boyfriend, the gay husband, the cheating husband, the married man, the New Years fling, the sweet attractive neighbor, the teenage son....but most importantly, it show how women react and deal with the lies, the cheating, and the friendships between both men AND women...and how to survive from that. Any woman who has ever gone through a relationship can relate to this movie, regardless of race, situation, or age. You will want to scream, cry and laugh throughout the whole movie, and I can guarantee that every woman has got a little Angela Bassett in her, especially when she rips through her ex-husbands belongings. Two thumbs up...A definite must-see for any woman with a wounded heart. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about 15 or 16 and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. A real disaster!; This movie is awful! The caracters are shallow and almost ridiculous, especially Lela Rochon. It's a very, very, very bad soap opera. I was watching this movie with my wife and we were laughing almost all the time. It is much too long, with no rhythm with absolutely no emotions. It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one cliché after another. Skip it, it's a waste of time! Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this 1995 film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Pathetic; This film is simply about a bunch of women who pick men who's behaviors they claim to hate & then spend the rest of their time complaining about them. It seems that this view is held by many women & possibly accounts in some measure to the number of women who consider their relationships with men to be unsatisfying. My favorite movie ever !; I'm so surprised by the comments i read here. Since i saw that movie maybe 10 years ago now, it's one of my favorite movie ever along with boomerang.Maybe it's because i was fairly young when i watched those movies.. but i find them extremely good. I watched the movie before i read the book and it may be the reason why i loved the movie so much. Sure Whitney's acting could have been better but she managed to do a pretty decent job overall. As for the soundtrack it's a pure bliss for RnB lovers and i would say a classic now. The image of Black men in the movie is very negative but in a sens it pushed to be the exact opposite so it kinda shaped my vision and my life, and \"deepend\" my love of black women. Some parts of the movie are just so classic like the break up between Robin and troy on the balcony and the soundtrack at that moment was some kind of a symphony.. anyways great great movie .. enjoy Extra in Movie; I was actually an extra in this movie and had a quite a fun time hanging out w/the cast/crew. I had an opportunity to be at several of the locations for days of filming and it was a lot of work. You don't realize what a day of filming entitles until you actually do it and I was just an extra. I was more interested in the process of the film making than being on camera so it was a great opportunity. I even got \"spoiled\" and met a lot of the cast and drove around in the SUV's that are for the main cast...fun stuff! I think over all the movie was to enjoy for fun. I think the basis of the friendships were the most important aspect of the film. That through all the craziness of men in their lives they were still there for one another. hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Hilarious in Parts; 1995 was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in 1995, the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker. 6 of 10 stars. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. in response to your response; I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :) I wanna move to Arizona; I thought It was a great movie, although it is a lot of sleeping with other women husband that are taken, we all have to be honest, this goes on a lot in reality. it's not right, but it happens.... Overall I really enjoy the movie because it took me way back to 1995, the movie was great. great times, although I was just 11 when it came out, I remember all the hype over this movie from my mom n my aunts.... One factor that I've never notice before was the setting... It makes me wanna pack up my family an move to peaceful Arizona.. Great Movie. r.i.p. Whitney Houston I cannot believe it took me all this time to see this movie all the way through... WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. I give this one 2 out of 10. FAbuLOuS; Simply fabulous. I thought it was a great movie. I was completely empowered! It made me want to start my exes car on fire. Embrace your independence  watch this movie. (is great to watch with the scorned over glasses of wine and bon bons) It'll make you laugh, cry, get mad, and then plot getting even. I can waste a lot of your time telling you to see it, defending it from what others say about it, or just generally talking it up. But haven't you always wanted to see Angela Basset throw a fit? How bout cut her hair off? And who wouldn't want to watch Whitney act with humility. This is by far my favorite movie with Whitney - second, The Bodyguard - third, The Preachers Wife. Frustrating...; That's the word I'd use to describe the film, an adaptation of Terry McMillan's 1992 best-seller. It's not great, it's not bad, but it's frustrating to watch, and the fact that I'm of the male persuasion undoubtedly had something to do with it. Now, let me be the first to say that I did enjoy seeing a group of strong black women portrayed onscreen. To say that Hollywood has been exceedingly lax in this regard is an understatement. But it would've been nice if their collective talents hadn't been squandered on this disgustingly anti-male tirade. Especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine, who otherwise shine in everything their names are attached to. Good, solid movies about sisterhood are probably needed now more than ever, but not at the cost of shortchanging the good, upright, decent brothers out there, whom this movie largely forgets about (with some notable exceptions -- Gregory Hines, for example.) And the frustration doesn't end there. Both Savannah and Robin manage to find themselves involved with the most shady characters (a married man and a dope fiend, respectively), yet they complain about the lack of good men out there. I suppose it would be silly to question just where they've been looking, even though it might hold the answer. The sad thing is that there are fellas out there who have little to no regard for women (\"the scum of the f__king earth\", to quote Savannah), and women who fall for fellas like that for the most silly, shallow reasons. If it wasn't for Bassett, Devine, and Babyface's score, this movie would barely be watchable. As it is, it's a moderately entertaining diversion, albeit a frustrating one. Don't Exhale Just Yet; I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It's not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others, it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However, the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria -- even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger, Holly Hunter, Alfre Woodard and others. Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight, insecure no-nonsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight, but she was the only one who found it (and deserved it). She was the only one who didn't sleep around, wasn't a man basher, set a good example for her son, and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face -- look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things, her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent, good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie. Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package --- beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life - she could now start her catering business, she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end. Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book, you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men. Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same -- Whitney Houston being well groomed, pretending to be well spoken and classy, and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise (although she might have been too young). The character had to tell us she was smart -- in a phone conversation with her mother she said \"I'm smart, I'm a good person and I work hard.\" Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills, doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end. This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn't \"tell this story\" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were. Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue? Sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE HARD TRUTH) looked VERY beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts REALLY made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Good movie, Better book; This wasn't a bad movie. The acting was great (although Whitney Houston still seems mediocre). Some of the scenes were powerful and funny. However, unlike the book which also deals with the sisterhood of Black women, the movie becomes a long \"Men are pigs\" tirade that gets weary after a while. Plus it's sometimes hard to root for the characters. For instance, considering all the one-night stands Savannah has, it's hard to see why she's questioning her ability to find a good man. Overall, Waiting to Exhale, is basically a sorely-needed bonding movie for African-American women that, while a little biased, is good escapist fun. Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops & horrible movies. A One-Sided Celebration of African American Feminism; Directed by Forest Whitaker and adapted from a smash best selling novel by Terry McMillan, WAITING TO EXHALE is a glossy, but one-sided look at the relationship between four strong black women and the various men in their lives. The film is one-sided because the screenplay presents most of the male characters as sexist, manipulative pigs without a redeeming characteristic in sight, but the sensitive direction and outstanding performances keep the rather lopsided story watchable. Whitney Houston made an impressive film debut as Savannah, an ambitious television executive caught in a dead-end affair with a married man (Dennis Haysbert). Angela Basset does Oscar-worthy work as Bernadine, a woman who has spent her life being the best wife and mother she knows how to be, who has her world rocked when her wealthy husband (Michael Beach) calmly announces one night before a formal dinner party that he's in love with someone else and wants a divorce. The scene where Bernadine gathers all her husband's stuff and makes a bonfire out of it in her driveway is one of the film's highlights. Lela Rochon plays Robin, a not-too-bright doormat who finds herself pregnant by a man she wants nothing to do with. Loretta Devine is fun as Gloria, a hairdresser who is divorced from her husband, who it turns out was gay, and is struggling to raise her son (Donald Faison) and tries to begin a relationship with a new neighbor (Gregory Hines). If you can accept the fact that in the world of these four women, all men are pigs, then this film can be very entertaining but the top-notch performances by the cast cannot be overlooked. A bit too soapy but deserves respect for being a positive film for black women; Vannah is travelling to see her friend Bernie while leaving behind all her old live to start anew.  Bernie has just been left by her husband of 13 years for a white woman.  Robin wants to be loved and happy but always makes the wrong choices.  Glo has an estranged husband and the only man in her life is her teenage son.  The four get together through their struggles in love and live as they try to put it all together again. This is very much a woman's film and, as a man, it's easy for me to criticise it for being a weepy or for being a bit of a woman love in, so I won't.  The plot is pure soap opera, the lives and loves of our 4 women, however it is still involving as the four stories all have strengths as well as weaknesses.  The mix of comedy and sentiment is a bit too much 20:80 and at times the sentiment gets too much, but the sassy characters keep the interest. The soapy sentiment isn't helped by a poor soundtrack and poor use there of. In itself I like some of the love ballad r'n'b stuff  but here it felt like it was all over every scene.  This really bogs it down. Also a down side is the whole man hating thing  only a few come off looking good.  I thought the director being a man would help redress the balance but it seemed to have no effect. Why  can someone tell me  was Houston chosen to lead this talented black cast?  Was it because she could do a cut price soundtrack?  She's a poor actress and he spoiled her scenes  she needs to stay in TVM's.  Bassett however is powerful as ever and really steals every single scene she's in.  Devine adds comedy and sauce while Rochon is perfect as the vulnerable beauty going about love the wrong way.  The male cast is great too  there are so many well known faces in this with only two criticisms of them  1  everytime I see Haysbert now all I can think of is his 24 character.  And 2  Wesley Snipes' character just don't convince me at all. Overall to criticise this for being girly or sentimental is to miss the point.  It is actually good to see a film with so many good roles for black actresses.  It's a bit too soapy for my taste but it is funny and involving with a commanding Bassett.  Only Huston, a soppy soundtrack and constant man caricatures spoil it. Double Standard; So I finally got around to watching \"Waiting to Exhale\" on Encore the other night and I don't understand why this became a hit. (Note: spoilers ahead) As far as I can tell, the basic premise of this film is that all men are insensitive, callous and unfeeling; especially towards women. Okay, well and good. That is the storyline? Fine. Men suck, got it. But there is a huge double standard here; two of the women are dating married men and clearly, we are meant to be sympathetic about their plight as they whine and cry about not having \"their\" man with them at night in bed. How about this? STOP DATING MARRIED MEN! Maybe that's your problem in the first place. Now, on the flip side, Angela Basset's character is abandoned by her husband for another woman. Yet, if you pay attention, even this character is not completely innocent. When her husband informs her he is leaving, the things she says makes it clear she's known about his lover(s) for years but ignored his infidelities. Why? Obviously, because he's so wealthy. She liked all the \"stuff\" a little too much to have confronted him about it. Again, she's made her bed here, not as completely as the two who are actively cheating, but still. She spends the rest of the movie being so angry that he left her you never really grow to like her. Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer; he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar. With their clothes on, which apparently means it's oh-so-platonic and sweet. Then he writes her a letter months later, thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off, he'll contact her again. Did anyone else think this was more than a little sleazy? I would hope if I were dying of breast cancer that my husband wasn't out sleeping around (and I do mean just sleeping) with other women. Sweet, platonic, whatever; I think it's pretty horrible. Bottom line; the characters you're supposed to connect to are unlikable and the ones you're supposed to hate are just pathetic. Not very enjoyable. However, I did give it three stars for the music, which didn't suck too badly and the clothes and style. It's a nice little snapshot of how things looked in '95. And the print wasn't very faded. That's about it, though. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Hot Soundtrack, Terrible Character Development; Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end.  It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales.  However, much of this is wasted on poor character development.  Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover.  What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies.  While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the \"nice\" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all.  For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script.  Clearly the answer is that it isn't.  Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with.  Why the director didn't see this, I don't know. Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface. 4/10 Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. A 3 is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. not bad; this movie and its story are quite good on the whole..........Ms Bassett is the leading and the best actress,for sure.I get her character.she's beautiful and I guess she's blown people away with her beauty and the EASE WITH WHICH SHE FASCINATES.Ms HOUSTON IS NOT TO NEGLECT NEITHER.She looks natural in this one.And despite her little experience as far as her actress career is concerned,she is good even though her story is a bit common .Loretta is divine!Anyways,this motion picture is merely good.There's nothing amazing.And it don't stand out from all the other movies.the only thing that makes me stick to the screen is the complicity and the crude humor on men of the four ladies! Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life. Please. great touching story; While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life's mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation. WAITING TO EXHALE : Waiting To Go Somewhere, But Sadly It Never Does...; WAITING TO EXHALE Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. \"Waiting To Exhale\", Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book, had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it's star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene. \"Waiting To Exhale\" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone. It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn't know the word \"feelings\" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change. For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they've experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don't seem to learn squat. It's like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. \"Waiting To Exhale\" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose. ... D ... Great female flick of the '90s!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track 6: This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              A (Rare) Good Sequel; The first \"Father of the Bride\" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin's great comedic \"Dad\" character with the emotions of marrying off his \"only\" (to that point!) daughter. However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor. Thankfully, \"Father of the Bride II\" does not fall into this trap. With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather. Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton). Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women! Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments. Whereas the first film captured George's equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George's identity crisis. With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family. Overall, this film is just as good as the original. The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare. Let's just say that if a \"Grandfather of the Bride\" were in the works, I would be first in line. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in 1995. It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. 2.5 out of 5 stars. Deja Vu; I found this sequel to be both charming and entertaining. What I learned tonight is that this movie is actually a remake of the 1951 movie \"Father's Little Dividend\", which in turn was the sequel to the original \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and with the same great cast: Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Bennett, et al.  They both share the same broad comedy and story line (only one pregnancy in the earlier version though), and in their own ways are equally entertaining.  Old or new incarnations, however, be sure to see parts one and two in sequence. Better than the original; This one is definitely better than the original, funnier, smoother pace, and in some places, better acting! Plus Martin Short has more screen time. Great! This is a great movie for anyone who like good clean comedy. Awesome! Five out of Five Moose Stars! Father of the Bride II; Likable, but not as impressive a follow up to the 1991 hit with Martin now dealing with his daughter being pregnant...And, oh yeah...his wife is pregnant again too. Entertaining, but the premise has been worn thin -- it's sweet, but unnecessary.; The original \"Father of the Bride\" with Spencer Tracey is a really good comedy, the remake starring Steve Martin is a good sweet-natured, amiable enough comedy - and I don't really think a sequel was necessary at all. I mean the whole premise is basically the same - before George Banks (Martin) had to grasp the reality of his daughter being married, and now he has to come to grips with the fact that she's having a baby. A nice twist on this is that his wife (played by Diane Keaton) is ALSO pregnant, but nevertheless it's still (basically) the same as the first film in one form or another. Thankfully it doesn't seem like a total cash-in (like so many sequels of this sort do) because it has a certain charm (as did the first film) and is still remarkably entertaining, all considered. But you can tell it was made solely because of the success of the first film - even Martin Short is back with another extended cameo as Franz the wedding manager. Of course you may be wondering why he's involved with a pregnancy, since his business is weddings. Here's a hint: more $$$ for the studio. Martin is basically doing the same thing he did in the first film - the weary upper-class guy who feels overwhelmed by the state of things. Diane Keaton is still very sweet and likable as his wife. The rest of the cast (including Macaulay's little brother Kieran Culkin) range from OK to good. Martin Short, however, is yet again a stand-out and is very funny - he wasn't necessary for the plot but he is funny and a good addition to the movie regardless. Overall I'd say this is one of those sequels that didn't need to be made, but could have been a lot worse. It's sweet, it's got some good lite-comedy moments, and in general it's just an enjoyable family movie that isn't trying to be anything other than simple entertainment -- which it is. Touching even in its weak state.; Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, and kimberly Williams Paisley return in Father of the Bride Part 2. The film as a sequel was slightly disappointing, but on the whole, likeable. George and Nina Banks are in for the surprise of their lives when they find themselves middleaged and expecting their third child.  The timing is impeccable as Annie Banks-MAckenzie also realizes that she is expecting. Thus Steve MArtin embarks on a nine month journey that will consist of him building a new room for the baby, watching his daughter become a woman and overdosing on sleeping pills.  Honestly, the film made me laugh hysterically and i shed a few tears at the bittersweet ending. 3 and 1/2 stars out of five. Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video Funny Sequel; Geogre Banks is getting used to life without his precious daughter Anne. Now he is thinking about all the free time he will have when his son is out of the house.That`s when Anne announces that she is going to have a baby.Geogre is shocked but he becomes even more shocked when he finds out his wife is going to have baby as well.Now he has to deal Franck helping out with the two pregnant women.Can Geogre ever get a break? This is my second favorite movie.My first is Father of the bride part I.This is a good movie.See it it is a great sequel.It is almost as good as the first one. Steve Martin steals the screen. AWESOME!; This movie is great!  I think it's one of the best movies ever made!  I love both Father of the Bride I and II!  I think that it is cute how they have the mother and daughter pregnant at the same time!  I hope that they come out with a Father of the Bride Part III, that would be awesome! :-) This is my favorite movie; ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is my favorite movie.  I think it is funny, sweet, and truly touches the heart.  In the sequel to the previous, Father of the Bride, George Banks (Steve Martin) is finally getting over the fact that his beloved daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams)has gotten married.  But then she shocks him with the news that she is pregnant.  Everyone else is thrilled, but George is not.  He believes that he is too young to be a grandfather.  He tries to become young, but doesn't succeed.  Then, both he and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton) are shocked to find out that Nina is also pregnant.  George now thinks he is too old to be a father.  They have one other child other then Annie, Matty (Kieren Culkin.)  Through the chaotic turns of pregnancy, George learns to except the fact that his daughter has grown up and moved on, even though it is hard.  They also have to deal with Fronk (Martin Short,) the goofy wedding coordinator from the first movie, who is now designing the new baby's room.  They then discover that Annie has been given the opportunity to design a museaum in Boston, far away from their own, San Marino, California.  George now realizes that he will miss his daughter more then ever, but he learns to get along.  In the end, he enjoys being a grandfather to baby George, and a father again, to Megan, named after the doctor who delievered her.  In this funny and heartwarming sequel, everyone puts out fantastic performences once again.  Even though I very much enjoy Father of the Bride, I enjoy this much more. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. The Best Movie of All Time; let me tell you.. anyone who does not like the movie is just a little close minded.. i read comments that thought the movie was too unrealistic but thats what makes it so great! i mean look at other movies such as lord of the rings or star wars neither or them contain true reality.. this is why its a movie. Anyway, i loved Steve martin in this movie. he does a magnificent job of playing the character for an over protective dramatic father. he was the best actor. who could have played the part of Nina as well as Diane Keaton. she makes the part of the mom annoyingly overwhelming mother, which is exactly what the point of us as the audience to think of her. martin short is the best of all \"fra'nk's\". the way he seeks George banks's approval is perfect. and lastly Kimberly Williams is the gorgeous daughter we are all expecting her to be.. i watch this movie every night before bed and i can recite every word to this movie. because of father of the bride II i have dreamed to meet Steve martin.. \"hes my hero!!\" hopefully you fall in love with it too. and dream to be pregnant with your mother as did Annie banks. A Well-Done Sequel!; A sequel to immensely likable Father of the Bride, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is A Well-Done Sequel! Its enjoyable as well as emotional! 'Father of the Bride Part II' Synopsis: George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. 'Father of the Bride Part II' is worthy sequel of a wonderful prequel. The characters still appeal, the humor works & the emotional moments are heartfelt as well. Nancy Meyers & Charles Shyer's Screenplay is genuinely well-done. Charles Shyer's Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography & Editing are fair. Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains. On the whole, 'Father of the Bride Part II' is a satisfying sequel. A so so sequel; 'Father of the bride' was a good film and probably didn't need a sequel. But this is Hollywood, everything needs a sequel. While it is clear that a lot of effort has gone into making this sequel work, the central idea stretches credibility and every idea the writer had seems to have been thrown at the wall in a desperate attempt to get laughs. There are moments that remind you of the heart and humour that the preceding film had, but it's a load of nothing really. I went into this film dubious about how good it could be, and I didn't finish watching it any more convinced that the original needed a sequel. daughter gets married; In the sequel to Father of the Bride we have the daughter getting married and moving away from home, this presents a big dilemma to the father played of course by Steve Martin. Maybe not quite as funny as the first one,, or as good,, but definitely above average,, it's always a pleasure watching Steve Martin work at his craft. The movie is basically about how the family,, especially the parents deal with their young daughter growing up,, getting married, and eventually moving away from the nest.. the cameo from Eugene Levy is just wonderful,, as a real estate agent who is trying to sell the very home where our main character lives.. all in all a very family friendly movie,, that I would recommend. Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. Better than the first one!; I love Steve Martin, but I was disappointed by the first movie, so I wasn't expecting as much from this one.  But to my surprise, this one was even better! It's constantly funny, just like one should expect from Steve Martin; it's not preoccupied with corny emotion, like the first movie was. It's Steve Martin in his best performance since \"My Blue Heaven.\" Sometimes sequels can be surprisingly good.  This one is better.  It has all the comedic elements that were stagnant in the first movie.  It's everything the first movie should have been, and more! Father of the Bride Part II; The first film was the remake of the original version starring Spencer Tracy and Dame Elizabeth Taylor, and it became very popular, so naturally they felt like a sequel was needed to continue the story. Basically George Banks (Golden Globe nominated Steve Martin) is getting used to the fact that his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) has become the bride now wife and got married to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), and more surprisingly a mother when she reveals she is pregnant. With this revelation comes out George has a small midlife crisis, and he tries to recapture his youth, including dying his hair, but he does eventually settle somewhat and get used to the idea that he will be a grandfather. But then he is shocked to find out he will be a father again as well when his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) reveals that she is also pregnant, and it may appear that both her and Annie's baby will be born on the same day. With these things happening, and the house having leaks and termites there is the opportunity to change things by selling the house to Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy), but he changes his mind later. When George manages to get the house back, despite a higher price, he gets the help of camp wedding planner/coordinator, now interior designer, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) to make the baby rooms and get things ready for the arrival of children. There are a couple of false alarms from Annie where she thinks the baby is coming, but eventually it comes to the real thing, and they rush to hospital, and of course Nina goes in to labour as well. In the end George is very happy to be holding both his new baby son and his new baby granddaughter is his arms, before his daughter and her husband move away to their own new home. Also starring Kieran Culkin as Matty Banks, B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein, Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie and Jane Adams as Dr. Megan Eisenberg. I can see what the critics mean by giving it two out of five stars in certain places, it certainly isn't as funny as the original film, it concentrates more on the sentimental material, but that's not a bad thing for this comedy drama. Okay! Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. 5/10 \"Father 2\" : Born again.; Okay,now the sequel \"Father Of The Bride 2\",which was surprisingly better than expected. Like anyone who sees a sequel,you expect almost a carbon copy of the first. It does start similar to the first movie,with George sitting in a chair addressing us,the audience. It also does an unfortunate repeat of the fight between Annie & Bryan,again like the first movie,I saw it coming. The baby shower party is not played big,like the first after wedding party but I laughed when actual storks carrying little bundles showed up. I was kind of \"iffy\" on the sub-plot of George selling the house,having to leave in ten days and then blowing a bundle to get it back again. I'm not questioning the probability (we know in reality that'd be impossible),I just found it kind of unnecessary. I did however like his dyed hair and new look,that was hilarious and he should have kept it until the end of the movie. Some may say the idea of a mother & daughter being pregnant at the same time,is impossible. Yet,somehow it works here. It's not just the obvious next step for Annie but for George and his wife too,who thought having babies was way behind them. I love Steve Martin's warped expression when Bryan calls him a \"Grandfather\"! I liked that a woman having a baby in her 40's was taken very seriously,since it's a fact that women who have babies later in life have a more difficult time. It makes for a good piece of drama in a film that's otherwise a family comedy. The comedy is helped once again by the presence of Martin Short and I like that he becomes more involved with the family. Especially helping George out the front door on his back. This after giving him sleeping pills for rest. Once the babies are born and Bryan & Annie head to Boston for a new life,the film gets a very touching ending with George and his new baby girl. 8 out of 10 for the expected repeat of ideas,otherwise a very well made sequel. (END) not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the 1951 movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the 1950 classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the 4 year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com Not bad...but could have been better; The first time I saw Father of the Bride 2 I really liked it.  I still enjoy watching some parts of it but I thought some realistic parts in the movie were not necessary.  First of all, the mother and daughter pregnant together.  This could happen but probably when the mother is not older than 40.  Nina had to be at least 47.  Is it likely that the mother would be pregnant at that age? I don't think so.  Secondly, I could not understand why George and Nina wanted the baby to have two last names.  Children always go by their father's last name and I thought Brian's father made a good observation when he said that George and Nina already had Matt to carry on the Banks name.  So why they thought the baby should have two last names is beyond me.  In conclusion, Father of the Bride 2 is still cute and fun to watch in some parts but I thought the first one was much better Some of Martin's best work!; First, this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2. If run back to back, they run like one beautiful story. This production is great from start to finish. Everything about it is wonderful, including the story, the acting performances and the direction. This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor. His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances. He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man. This movie is no exception. His performance is comedic, yet startlingly genuine. Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's. I love this movie. I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character; with how he feels, and what he's going through. This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum, and I love it. It's less about family, and more about life's curves; the every-day things that make us crazy, happy, sad, and ultimately stronger. It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think, consider, ponder the events which have led us to where we are now. Combined, they rate 8.6/10 from... the Fiend :. Good, so long as you don't try to think too much; It was a fun movie, but it had no particular substance. I mostly watched it because I'd seen the first one. And because it was free on my cable. Or at least, I wasn't paying only to see it. Now, I have done that before and been pleasantly surprised, but this just wasn't one of those movies. Most of what was in this movie has been done already in the first film, and then it was in a much better way. Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, I'm just glad that I got to watch it free. Sure, Steve Martin's always fun to watch, particularly when he's acting dopey for whatever reason, but that didn't make it a great film. Just mediocre. Still, it's fun for a laugh. Average comedy sequel; There's been better, and there's been worse. \"Father of the Bride Part II\" falls right in between when it comes to sequels of comedies. The plot was easily predictable and the movie didn't have as many Steve Martin funny moments as the original. There were some good moments that made me laugh though, most being scenes with Martin Short. It did seem like sort of a stretch, though that all of the sudden \"Frank\" was an interior designer as well as a wedding/baby shower coordinator. I guess they just needed a way to keep him in the movie longer. I was hoping for a lot more when I rented this. My advice: stick to the original. Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! Worthy second installment.; Mild SPOILERS are contained in the following comments. However, I believe everyone knows the story and how it turns out. The fun of the movie is seeing the actors, especially Martin. Steve Martin is back as George Banks, having just lost his daughter and basketball partner (Kimberly Williams as Annie ) to marriage, and now she is back home with her husband and a big announcement. She is pregnant. Of course everyone is happy, and the joy is doubled when Nina Banks (Diane Keaton as Annie's mom) finds out she is pregnant too. Poor George doesn't know if he can handle all this. After all, he is about to be a grandfather, he's not prepared to be a new father also. Martin Short is back as Franck Eggelhoffer, the unintelligible wedding planner. All ends well as both mom and daughter deliver their babies at the same time, in separate hospital rooms, so George has to go back and forth. The movie ends a few months later, and as Annie and her new baby are leaving, she gives dad a miniature basketball, a reminder to George that he can raise another basketball partner. Like Cliches?; ...That weren't even funny the first time? I've seen a lot of films with Steve Martin in them, and they all made me laugh.  Until this one. Part one is worth a look..it may make you laugh a couple of times (I think I laughed once).  But I recommend avoiding this one all together. not bad for a sequel; as sequels go,this is film isn't too bad.i didn't think ti was quite as good as the first one,but it's not a bad effort.i didn't find it as funny,and some of Steve Martin's histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me.really,this one doesn't quite have the same sincerity as the first.through much of this movie,i was all too aware i was watching a movie,whereas with firs tone,i was drawn in,and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting.having said that,there are some bright spots.for,one,this movie is just as touching as the first.and Eugene levy has a great cameo.and there is still some fun to be had.even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above,i still think Father of the Bride II is a 7/10 Not as good as the first, but still great fun.; In the sequel to the brilliant Father Of The Bride, Nina Banks and her daughter Annie are both pregnant and George Banks, being his usual nervous self has to learn to get used to the idea that he's going to be a father again AND a grandfather. The whole cast including, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams and Martin Short are all back here giving good performances. Even though Father Of The Bride Part II is not as good as the first Father Of The Bride, this is still a great movie which is enjoyable and fun all the way through and that's why I'm going to give this good sequel a 10/10.  Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. Good; This is well worth seeing. Everything goes perfectly. Ain't no such thing as too much Steve Martin, baby. Here Martin carries weak material, but it's a positive movie that shows the joy a new child brings. You will laugh, cry and cheer. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Some of the dialog is a bit lost on US audiences, but still some hilarious lines. The music is amazing throughout. Also the scenery is incredible. I saw the cast had a lot of great comedians, so I thought there would at least be a few laughs. Instead, I was surprised to see a very touching movie, absolutely great script. I give it 7 out of 10. What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... A really likable comedy.; I enjoyed this film. I found that it was easy to relate to Steve Martin's character George Banks as a parent. The relationship between him and his daughter Annie, played by Kimberly Williams, was an honest father daughter relationship. I recommend this one for parents in general and empty nesters in particular. The idea of a mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time is plausible and amusing. Fantastic; Both the first movie and this sequel are fantastic. I loved the first movie, so I thought I would give the second one a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised!! The acting from all the characters is amazing, from Steve Martin to Diane Keaton to Kimberly Williams-Paisley. 16 years after its release this movie is still a gem. When I'm feeling down or just need a go-to comedy for a night in, these two movies are the best. For those who say that a 40-something woman is too old to have a baby--that's just not true. Do your research. I bet more people have been in that situation than you think. Anyway, this is a feel-good movie for some great laughs and a few happy tears! I really found this film quite annoying; My basic opinion of this movie is that it is a crappy American feel good comedy. It is simply about a man who is going through another mid-life crisis as his daughter, who was married in the first movie, has a baby in this one. The catch is that his wife is also pregnant and with the irony really dripping, both of them have their babies within minutes of each other. As such the kid's auntie is exactly the same age as him (it won't happen to me, though it is possible). When I watch this movie I think to myself, this guy really doesn't have problems. There are people out there that have much more serious problems than he does. He admits to having a beautiful wife who loves him, owns his own home (or did), has a great job and great kids - and he thinks he has problems. Maybe the whole comedy is in the fact that he is worrying about absolutely nothing, but seriously, when I watch this movie, I simply shake my head and think that the guy is a loser. I really don't think it is all that funny. In fact, the guy has much more serious problems. He seems to be spending an awful lot of money, and is going to find himself in a huge amount of debt, and he doesn't seem to ever be at work. My question is not only where he gets his money, but where he gets the collateral for all of the purchases he is making. He buys back his house for an extra $100,000 on top of what he sold it for, and really, how can he seriously afford it. Okay, it wasn't all that bad. As a movie is was made well, and I did chuckle a few times. But in reality, this guy is a serious loser because he has more than anybody could possibly ask for, and he is worried about growing old. Hell, we all grow old, but he has experience more than what a lot of us have already had. Instead of worrying about growing old, the twit should look back on his life and be thankful for the blessings that God has already given him as opposed to forgetting all of that and winging about his age. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a 10, i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Very Warm and Funny.; This movie is a very warm and funny family film. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the Sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny. The only thing I didn't like was Eugene Levy's character, I found that his part was just put there to extend the movie a bit. I also didn't like how they used him in the second one when he was clearly the one who auditioned to be the wedding singer in the first one. All in all this is a great family film where many will enjoy and watch together. I loved it, but one thing bothered me...; I enjoyed this movie: Diane Keaton is my favourite actress, Steve Martin always makes me laugh and Martin Short is great, but I felt really sorry for Keaton having to pretend to be pregnant. She didn't seem to be enjoying it and when the Banks were at the hospital, she actually looked rather bored, because whenever she spoke from the moment George protested about the doctor's name, she almost made it sound like she was in a maths lesson. Apart from that, it was great! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching Martin, Keaton or Short in a movie or who likes to laugh. 9/10 because of the little problem, but it was great. I loved it. Not exactly the most innovative of films, but still great fun!; This is an excellent, funny, warming film. Although a lot of the \"same kind of thing\" was done in the first movie, it's still entertaining. Steve Martin's character was good, although at times his behaviour is quite pathetic and Martin Short is again entertaining. (Particularly his pronunciation of the word 'pregnant).' Although it's highly predictable and not the most intellectually stimulating of films it is still well worth watching and the vast majority of people would enjoy this film. And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW2, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. As I understand it, there were accusations of anti-Arab stereotyping?; \"Father of the Bride II\" may seem to some people like a lesser Steve Martin movie, with him as the patriarch from the previous movie now having to deal with his daughter's and wife's pregnancies. Unpretentiously silly. But one interesting thing is that apparently, some Arab groups claimed that the movie was making anti-Arab stereotypes, as a Middle Eastern man buys their house with plans to demolish it. I wouldn't have interpreted that as anti-Arab; I mean, it's not like they're portraying him as a terrorist. Oh well, life goes on. The movie's a nice, goofy way to pass time. I really liked the scene where they bring Steve Martin into the hospital (that would've sure been an embarrassment!). Also starring Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, B.D. Wong and Eugene Levy. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the 1951 sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of 50. This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Heartwarming & Hilarious; Steve Martin does it again in this touching and funny sequel to 1991's Father Of The Bride the rest of the cast returns in a new story dealing with the joys of parenthood. I loved Father Of The Bride II not only because it was funny, mostly it was due to the comic antics of a man dealing with two pregnancies at once. He's a great comedian as well as an on screen father, my favorite scene is when both babies arrive at the same time. A year has passed since George Banks (Martin) watched his only daughter Annie (Williams) get married and has accepted her transformation from daughter to wife. She comes home with her husband Brian (Newbern) to announce the wonderful news to her parents, brother Matty (Culkin) and in-laws that she's pregnant. Everyone is thrilled and excited except for George who thinks he's too young to be a grandpa, from then on he tries to act young by dying his hair and exercising. But things are about to get a little crazy when his loving wife Nina (Keaton)discovers she's pregnant too now George must deal with the impending arrival of both his grandchild and his own child. Thrown into the chaos is Franck Eggelhoffer (Short) the wedding coordinator who helps to design a room for the new addition to the Banks family. This movie is not only sweet but it's charming entertainment for fans of all ages. Not bad, but inferior to the first; I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the first movie. It was not without sentiment and it was hardly original, but it was still beautifully filmed, well acted, charming and funny. This sequel is not as good as the first I agree, but I still quite enjoyed it. The story is predictable, and there are some so-so parts in the script. Eugene Levy, who I do like by the way, is okay here but his character felt somewhat unnecessary and felt like he was there as an additional character and to give the film a longer length. And I also would have liked to have seen more of Kimberley Williams, she is so beautiful and quite a good actress, but I actually do agree that a little too much time is spent between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. However, it is beautifully filmed, has a nice soundtrack, decent pacing and good direction. And the acting is fine too, Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are still very likable, and while as I've said I would have liked to have seen more of her Kimberley Williams was lovely. And I loved Martin Short here too, he was one of the main merits of the first film, so to see him in his wonderfully fluffy turn again was a very nice surprise. Overall, not bad at all, could have been better, but I liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Pretty much just a rehash of the first; As this movie started, it reminded me a lot of the first. Various scenes were reenacted, only a little wackier, sort of like it was trying to be a shade more funny than the first; I guess that is the usual stuff for this type of sequels, but I think it failed at that. Apart from that, the movie pretty much succeeds in being a good sequel to the first. The story is also somewhat reminiscent of the first one. All the same actors return as well, and they are pretty much the same, just a shade more wacky. The story is also told by Steve Martins character, George Banks, like in the first. Pretty much everything in the movie is a takeoff of the first; this doesn't make it bad though, if you liked the first, liked the characters, you'll want to see this too, if nothing else, to see the characters again. It is about as funny and as sentimental as the first was, and as enjoyable. Fans of the first one, or of Steve Martin will most likely enjoy at least some part of it, as this is the typical for both the first movie and Steve Martin. 7/10 Father of the Bride Part II; The 1991 Steve Martin comedy proved out to be popular enough to earn a sequel, much like the original Father of the Bride of 1950. All of the main cast of the first film returns in a story where the eponymous father George Banks (Martin) has gotten over the stressful wedding of his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) and her fiancé Bryan (George Newbern). However, when she breaks the big news about her pregnancy to the family, the grandpa-to-be becomes anxious about getting older and starts proving his youthfulness in various ways, such as selling the family's beloved house to a greedy real estate developer Habib (Eugene Levy). Life has more in store for George and his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) though, as it soon turns out that Annie's is not the only pregnancy in the family. Again, the humour is best when it relies on Steve Martin's comical talent and charisma instead of craziness and exaggeration. Unfortunately, adhering to the rule of always making sequels bigger and louder, the writers have given more screen time to the unbelievably annoying wedding planner Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) whose noisy and flamboyant scenes are certainly the weakest parts of the whole movie. The fussy bumbling caused by the impending childbirths at the end is also rather annoying and unimaginative. I think the movie works best during the more subtle scenes, such as Martin making uncomfortable faces while hiding his nervousness or arguing about the baby's surname with the overjoyed family during a dinner. Besides the run-of-the-mill jokes, the movie also shamelessly wallows in impenetrable sentimentalism of the newborns' adorability. Especially the music is so unbelievably schmaltzy that it was really getting on my nerves while watching; can't the filmmakers just trust their material's appeal without burying it under a sweety-tweety sugar mountain? Nevertheless, despite the predictability of the plot and the not-so-hilarious jokes, George Banks is a very likable character and Steve Martin is at home in the role, so those who enjoyed the first movie will probably like this one too  the basic building blocks of the story have not been changed at all. One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. My comments are going to be very positive.; Hi! I think that Father of the Bride Part 2 was a great film and very hilarious. I think that the mother and daughter could have been pregnant at the same time!  It was a great movie and I recommend it to all people who want a warm-your-heart comedy! It's a great film! Thanks! Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. Loved it!!; I thought the sequel to the first Father of the Bride just showed what a great chemistry Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Kimberly Williams, George Newbern, and Kieran Culkin, along with all the other supporting actors have together. I would actually love to see a Father of the Bride Part III and I usually hate more and more sequels. I really do enjoy this sequel and I think it is better than the first one. I would reccommend any and everyone seeing this movie (but not without seeing the first one). like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $15k bonus to move out in 10 days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $100k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. Good, but first one was better; This film is good but you have to suspend disbelief quite a few times. All the performances are fine, with Steve Martin a scream again, and Diane Keaton glowing from start to finish (she has a lot more to do here than in FOTB1). The best scenes are: George trying to get buff in the gym, asking which famous men he's younger than, pointing to his wedding ring at the lady in the car next to him, and seeing all the misbehaving children out the window in his car while his wife sees all the happy kids and their parents out her window. And of course, when George holds his child and grandchild outside the delivery room. My favorite line: \"Now going to the movies will be economical: one child, two seniors, thanks!\" good, but a mistake; this movie rocks. but there is one thing weird. okay, so in the beginning Annie says, \"i have lived here since i was 5!\" and then later right when they are selling the house and playing basketball Annie and George(her dad) and her dad says \"i remember the first time we played out here, you were 4.\" wait...so was she 4 or 5 when they moved in??????????? other than that this movie makes me laugh, cry(because i laugh so much), and..........uh.....what was that other thing people say when they say that? i don't really remember. i just love how Steve martin always is so cheap. I am forced to say more so i will say i love that this movie is always on HBO! And i realized something, Steve martin has had white hair like forever! Not as good as the first, but good family fun; This movie is as thin as you can get. Its' emotions are easily played. There are no surprises. It is very predictable. And I say...so what? What is wrong with that? This is an American Dream movie. Everything goes perfectly and everyone is as happy as can be. Why should it be a complicated character study? It deals with the birth of babies. There's no complex feelings that need to be dealt with in this situation. A life is being created. A family is being blessed. A baby's birth is a time for love and hope. This movie has both in spades. It's a very positive movie that shows the joy a new baby brings. Every parent-to-be should watch it. A child's birth is an emotional event with no equal. This movie knows it and milks it for all its' worth. My only complaint is it should have been called Parents of the Bride. Way too much time is spent with the relationship between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. There should have been more attention paid to Kimberly Williams. Not only were the scenes between her and Martin the best scenes in this and the original, but Kimberly Williams is the most beautiful actress to come out of Hollywood in many years. Forget all the blond, silicone filled, bimbos that every teenage boy raves about. Ms. Williams is a natural beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late '40's)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now...  "

The tokenizer also filters out punctuation to avoid having random punctuation that does not convey any meaning in our word analysis."

       "      <td>a somewhat cheaper copy of Antonioni's 'Blow Up'; Although not bad, 'Col guore in gola' is clearly inspired by Michelangelo Antonioni's 'Blow Up' -- the famous film from 1966, capturing London's young &amp; fashionable mid-Sixties spirit with unparalleled quality. This Italian copy even goes as far as mentioning Antonioni. 'Col guore in gola's somewhat hazy plot clearly does not make this film's main attraction. It's the visuals that are prominent here, and they surely are great and inspiring. And very, yes very, mid-Sixties -- as well as a little too extended to our 21st century-taste. Male lead Jean Louis Trintignant does not need any introduction. His performance is as usual: most competent. Female lead Ewa Aulin, reminding me of Goldie Hawn, does well, too. Together they take you through 'Col guore in gola', making you a nice watch. Jean-Louis Trintignant falls for Ewa Aulin and hunts for a murderer; \"I Am What I Am\" is a line that Ewa Aulin delivers in this film, and it's a meaningful title in the context of the story. \"Deadly Sweet\" is another title this goes under, and that too is meaningful. Ewa Aulin is not going to change for Trintignant, and she is as deadly as she is sweet. The story intertwines a murder mystery and a love story. In a nightclub, Trintignant is attracted to Ewa Aulin whose father has been killed by an automobile. He watches her from a distance. Later he finds the club owner killed and Ewa is present but denies having killed him. The owner had something on her father. Trintignant and she flee the scene and begin a search for information and a photograph. They have a torrid affair and he's thoroughly hooked on her. Certain of her lies crop up and trouble him, but she seductively patches the matters over. A second murder occurs, which is of the man who supposedly has the photo. Again, the two of them find the body. Trintignant alone finds and pockets an ear ring near the corpse. Both avoid the cops, who play no role of any substance in the story. They are pursued, however, by hoods at times. Ewa's brother also comes into the story as a complicating factor and suspect. The hoods at one point kidnap Ewa. Trintignant and the brother have to deal with that. This film digresses at times or takes liberties with the viewers. It does this in several sequences. One shows the flirtation of Trintignant and Aulin in a park. There are several others that show the sixties kind of culture, war newsreels, nightclub dancing, etc. These sequences shift the focus of the film away from being a straight-out psychologically-influenced mystery, but they also show the milieu or psychedelic scene in which Trintignant would fall for a 17-year old girl and how he would expect her to behave as being from that generation. Trintignant's movies are typically worthwhile. I try to see every one I can. He has a remarkable capacity to underplay his roles and yet become the character he is portraying. Deadly Sweet....; Just saw this tonight uncut on the big screen here in Hollywood. Visually very nice. But not really a giallo, I don't know why people keep calling it that. There is a murder which basically occurs off-screen and has almost nothing to do with the \"story.\" Virtually no violence, some eyebrow-raising sex, obviously inspired by Antonioni, et al. Little story, lots of avant garde/graphic style, references to Pop-Art/Lichtenstein, comics, \"Blow-Up\" and other movies/the Viet Nam War/other issues of the day. Nice visuals/editing/soundtrack (which was remarkably clear in the print I just saw, supposedly soon to be out on DVD). At times notably innovative and fresh. A bit of a surprise ending. Wandering narrative, quick cuts, lots of color and gritty flair. Swinging London backdrop. In b/w and color. Not a great film, but worth seeing; This pop psychedelic giallo is an early film by the Italian \"master of eroticism\" (he's definitely \"master\" of something), Tinto Brass. Unfortunately, it's VERY derivative of Michaelangelo Antonioni's \"Blow-up\" from the previous year, and while some find that movie borderline pretentious, this movie is well over the borderline. It also compares pretty unfavorably to the OTHER pop psychedelic giallo released in 1967, \"Death Laid an Egg\", which also features French actor Jean Trintigant and Swedish nymphet Ewe Aulin. But just because it isn't as good as two excellent movies like \"Blow-up\" and \"Death Laid an Egg\" doesn't necessarily make it bad. It's well filmed, and it has good acting and good music. I actually liked it better than \"Salon Kitty\", \"Caligula\" or any of Brass' other later, more erotic, but much more tedious ventures. The story is pretty insubstantial. A man spots a a young girl at a disco and is immediately drawn to her. Later he finds the disco owner dead and the young woman standing over his body. Since the disco owner was apparently blackmailing her recently deceased father, the girl suspects that the killer might be a member of her own oddball family--her androgynous twin brother, her grasping mother, or her sinister gangster stepfather. As the couple are chased all over Swinging late 60's London by all kinds of colorful characters, including a hulking black man and a dwarf, they try to piece together the bizarro plot (while the viewers try even less successfully to do the same thing). Brass also throws in a lot of black and white footage--perhaps in an homage to American film noir--however, this style really clashes with the colorful psychedelic pop art and the principal story, which far from being downbeat and noirish, is often as light and airy as a soufflé. Trintigant was one of the most famous French actors of the period. He was kind of in the same mold as Jean-Paul Belomondo, Jean Sorel, and Alain Delon. But he didn't seem to rely as much on his good looks as some of his fellow French leading men, and he was often in more interesting, offbeat films like Robbe-Grillet's \"TransEuropean Express\", \"The Angry Sheep\", and, of course, \"Death Laid an Egg\". Ewe Aulin, who was only seventeen at the time, did this film as part of a 1967 trifecta which also included \"Death Laid an Egg\" and the big-budget celebrity-train-wreck sex comedy \"Candy\". Only one of these was really a good movie, but SHE is definitely very memorable in all three of them. If nothing else, this is certainly a prime example of a European co-production of the era--an Italian film shot in London with a French leading man and a Swedish leading lady. This is by no means a great film, but it is worth seeing. \"The Sixties - What a shrill, pointless decade\"; Tinto Brass is one of the more critically applauded Italian directors, what with the films Salon Kitty and the one called Caligula that had Malcolm McDowell as Caligula bumming some unwilling guy. That's how I felt watching this uneasy mash-up of Giallo and sixties groovy crapfest. This was truly a struggle from start to finish. French Guy gets involved with Jane, a groovy chick whom he finds in a room with a dead nightclub owner. French Guy thinks she didn't do nothing, and the two embark on a journey to find out who really killed the nightclub owner. Sadly for them and us a relentless barrage of sixties references assault them and the viewer until you don't care what happens, as long as the film ends some time soon. Jane has a brother who has gone missing and there's a load of bad guys following the two around everywhere trying to kill French Guy and kidnap Jane, including a dwarf who gives French guy a kicking. Jane gets herself kidnapped and French Guy hooks up with her brother to rescue her. Other stuff happens but you'll have killed yourself long before then. The problem with this film is that it's crap. Brass has the bones of a giallo film but for some reason feels the need to constantly refer to the 'swinging' sixties, with constant references to pop art, the Beatles, freak-outs, all that stuff. It's like a film being made these days with constant references to fidget spinners, fake news, and people voluntarily micro-chipping themselves so that they can programme their heating from their hands (what's wrong with those morons?) A lot of the time I was suffering from a very large Jess Franco vibe from this film, and by that I mean there was a lot of messing around on nothing that seriously disrupted the flow of the film and making me not care at all about anything that happened at all. Average Giallo from a T&amp;A man.; When I see Tinto Brass, I think of Cheeky and Salon Kitty. T&amp;A features, not traditional giallo. I am willing to be surprised. You are going to be reminded by a current jail occupant in Orlando, Fl, who was dancing the night away after her daughter went missing. The children. Jane (Ewa Aulin) and Jerome (Charles Kohler) Burroughs, in this film are in a nightclub right after they visit their father in the morgue. Guess death can't interfere with life. Bernard (Jean-Louis Trintignant) discovers her with his dead partner and takes her away. They go looking for the killer. It's not as bloody as most giallo, and there is no nudity to speak of, but it is worth watching. It had an almost comic book air at times, and the music was definitely upbeat. The cinematography was outstanding on this print and really made it worthwhile. Inexpensive and dated mystery.; Well, Eva Aulin is certainly delicious and Jean-Louis Trintignant is sympatico as is usually the case, but the film in its entirety suffers from a poor script and from the director's misguided whimsy. Trintignant visits his partner's office, up the stairs from a dance hall, and discovers Aulin standing over the body, holding a gun, saying she didn't do it. Trintignant takes a second look at seventeen-year-old, blond, robustly figured, ex-Swedish-beauty-contest-winner Eva Aulin and quickly decides, \"Right, she couldn't have done it.\" He runs off with her to search out the REAL killers, and we are treated to a tour of swinging London's most-visited sights. Here's Picadilly Circus. See all the skin shops? And, look -- here's a poster of The Beatles! There's also a kind of zoo. There are small shots of one of Trintignant's eyes. It gets confusing. I think they copulate on top of Nelson's Column but I'm not sure. I AM sure they copulate in Trintignant's apartment in a scene that is all apricot and rose and consists of unidentified hands caressing unidentified body parts. I guess Brass forgot to include the softly billowing crimson drapes and the lighted candles. When somebody hits someone else over the head, there are Pop inserts of the sounds, as in the old Batman TV series -- POW! and ZLONK! I've only seen three or four of Tinto Brass's movie but I'm already able to discern a kind of stylistic arc through the murk. In this film, the earliest of his that I've seen, he appears to be doing everything possible to draw attention to himself as the director. (The screen splits into three separate scenes at one point.) And the relentless use of pop imagery is symptomatic. Hey, look! Mamma mia, I'm inna movies! In a somewhat later film, I think called \"L'Uolo,\" about a handful of people in a surrealistic hotel, the narrative is thrown out completely and we get one bizarre image after another -- no longer just pop, but a kaleidoscopic non sequitur that carries no weight at all after the first few shocking minutes. Finally, Brass found his metier, in the no-man's land between soft-core and hard-core porn. The stories in this later genre aren't original. Usually a bourgeois wife is bored with her marriage and finds a lover who introduces her to, well, a different kind of love. It wasn't original with \"Emanuelle\" either, or \"Lady Chatterly's Lover,\" for that matter. I'd guess that the theme was first introduced to a public audience somewhere back in time, past Aristophanes, into the Masques, into the mists of antiquity. Of the three phases of Tinto Brass's career, I prefer the last one, the one with the preposterous, prodigious, prosthetic penises. At least there, the director seems to have found a comfortable and satisfying niche. The Italian title, \"Col Cuore in Gola,\" means \"With Heart in Throat,\" but the English title is as much a puzzle as the movie itself. \"I Am What I Am.\" Is it from Yahweh or Popeye? I've been told this is a \"cult movie.\" I wonder what a cult movie is. nice giallo;  A rather unusual agenda from tinto brass who obviously found later his niche in \"t&amp;a\" movies. Col cuore in Gola is a psychedelic, pop art giallo that can just come from the great era of the late 60´s/70´s. Starting from the nice credits and music you immediately like this film and this is just the beginning! Trintignant founds in a nightclub a corpse beside the lovely aulin who just says \"i wasnt it\" Convinced that she is innocent he wants to help her and want to find out the murderer, Aulins brother should solve this case and both are searching for him. Though not quite without problems..a dwarf in raincoat is following them in companion with some gangsters who kidnap Aulin. Jean is now searching for aulin, aulins brother and (of course) the murderer. The Story itself is not that convincing (rather unimportant) but what here is really of interest is the unconvential style of brass : splitscreen(even tripple split screens!) some scenes in black and dark yellow filter and more.., and in the \"middle\" of course the presence of two very convincing leads: cool Trintignant and hot Ewa Aulin. (somehow priceless here in white fishnet stockings) the result is a quite good giallo with (obviously) strong references to pop art. In the same year Aulin and Trintignant appeared in the avantgarde giallo masterpiece \"Death laid an egg\", Col Cuore in Gola is not great as Giulio Questis film but is definitely entertaining. AKA ... Deadly Sweet; This film is very stylized, liked a lot of the editing effects, the split images in-particular, also how it cuts to war images of Vietnam and changes to black and white in parts. The sets, costumes/wardrobe are elaborate and detailed, the lighting is very good also. Interesting to see London in the 60's, notice how the trains are still powered by steam in the scene behind the graveyard. The casting is quite strong especially Jean-Louis Trintignant who plays the lead role, he is supported by the beautiful Ewa Aulin, the cast of nefarious mob type figures is also a standout. The storyline although a little weak leaves you guessing until the end. It is quite enjoyable overall, but seems a little experimental and doesn't really mesh, but I liked the fact it had a sad ending.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Pleasing holiday comedy thanks to splendid cast...; Anyone who has watched the recent remake of 'Christmas in Connecticut' will fully appreciate just how wonderful the slim story was in the hands of Barbara Stanwyck, Dennis Morgan and Sydney Greenstreet. No masterpiece, but so much better than the weak remake. The whole film revolves around the mistaken belief by editor Greenstreet that Stanwyck (his favorite Martha Stewart-type of writer) is a homemaker with a house, husband and baby in the country. This, of course, means that the inventive woman has to enlist the aid of others to play out her scheme when Greenstreet invites himself and a ship-wrecked sailor (Dennis Morgan) for the holiday week-end. The slight comedy develops a few complications along the way--and it all looks very holidayish with the lovely country home in Connecticut--which, thanks to Warner Bros. art decoration, looks like something from a magazine cover. Stanwyck's forte is really heavy drama but here she displays a light enough touch to make her scenes with Morgan and Greenstreet delightful to watch. She gets great support from Una O'Connor, S.Z. Sakall and Reginald Gardiner under Peter Godfrey's light-hearted direction. It's as unpretentious a confection as a child's homemade Christmas card and just as charming--light and fluffy entertainment that makes no great demands on your viewing pleasure. Worth viewing, especially around the holidays. A movie of missed opportunities!; At 102 minutes, this Barbara Stanwyck/Dennis Morgan entry is allowed to run too long. After all, it is  as every customer will instantly recognize  one of those movies that give away their entire plot line in the cast credit titles. It's obvious that the beautifully photographed Barbara Stanwyck is going to fall for and marry serviceman Dennis Morgan. Anything Barbara has to say to anybody else in the cast is just wasting time  unless she says something particularly witty or humorous. She doesn't! If I was writing this screenplay, I would be sure to add plenty of humor to Barbara's dialogue. I'd make sure that she was always bitingly sarcastic, particularly in her exchanges with Sydney Greenstreet. But in fact, she doesn't assert herself at all. Why the hell not? Instead, she treats him with kid gloves and sucks up to the self-opinionated moron. Why? I'll admit the writer was aware of this problem, so he or she or they paint the Stanwyck character as a liar. And an opportunistic liar at that! One of those liars who will tell you anything either to get out of a scrape or to advance their own career! I'll admit Barbara does her damnedest to soft peddle this aspect, but it's there all the same! In fact, soft peddling is the wrong approach. You make her someone who glories in her lies, not someone who's ashamed of them. That's ridiculous! There's an excellent performance here by Greenstreet as the mogul you love to hate and whom you'd just adore to see getting his comeuppance from a fiery Barbara  but it doesn't happen! I could go on and on, but let's just agree that C. in C. is easy to sit through once, but it's a movie of hundreds of missed opportunities. That's an exaggeration. Let's say, dozens of missed opportunities. Available on an excellent Warner Brothers DVD. Not One Of My Favorites; This movie has inexplicably become a Christmastime favorite but I don't get it. Full of preposterous turns of events, poor acting likely due to direction since it involves such otherwise great actors, boring scenes, an overly long story line that never seems to end and the miscasting of Barbara Stanwyck as a romantic lead (sorry, I don't see her in that role and in fact this movie shoots her face in ways that makes her look the least attractive I've ever seen her in a movie), this movie disappoints. (Stanwyck has ugly looks on her face, in fact, in the sleigh ride scene and I wonder why these were not re- shot.) The one saving grace in this movie is S.Z. Sakall; this movie showed off his talents well. But others did not fare so well, in my humble opinion. For example - Sydney Greenstreet's final lines (delivered with an unnecessarily extreme camera close-up) were not delivered well nor was his facial expression flattering. I would have re-shot those moments or - better yet - given the film a better ending. It was kind of lame. The love story, in the final analysis, in all its twists and turns, does not ring true. Not believable. I must be wrong though - since Robert Osborne, the noted film historian, thinks this is a great film. My bad. But, personally speaking, this is one movie I could not stand to see ever again. I found it excruciatingly dull and improbable. When the Christmas tree is up watch this film with your family; A lighthearted, joyful comedy that gives the new, superbly comedic, meaning to a traditional Christmas party. Very amusing and hearty, Christmas in Connecticut presents a wonderfully cheerful love story with many slapstick elements. When a war hero Jefferson Jones comes back home and wants to spend the Holidays in a nice, homely atmosphere, fate sends him to the doorstep of a well-known food critic Elisabeth Lane. Unfortunately for her, she has lied for a long time to her readers about having a loving family and a house in the countryside.And now is the time for a perfect set-up. With the help of a few friends she arranges a drastically improvised make-believe ceremony. As one can imagine, from the beginning nothing seems to go as planned and after a few laughable moments everything goes amusingly berserk. Love takes over, and Elisabeth - despite having a still unwed, fake husband - falls in love with her handsome guest. The whole mystification goes out of control and the Christmas in ruined for the amusement of some, and for the disgust of others. With an enchanting feel and many hilarious sequences, Christmas in Connecticut is a screwball comedy that will definitely appeal to most viewers, more so during the annual family gatherings. Lightweight But Pleasant Holiday Feature; This lightweight but pleasant holiday feature makes the most out of a pretty slim premise, thanks to a solid cast and some resourceful writing. Not meant to be taken very seriously, it provides easygoing entertainment with some simple but upbeat themes. Barbara Stanwyck was an interesting choice as the lead, and she makes it work well enough. The premise of Stanwyck's writer character trying to fool everyone and maintain her image is more suited to screwball comedy than to a holiday feature, but the tone is kept light and funny while having just enough of the holiday atmosphere to be believable. The supporting cast helps out, with the likes of \"Cuddles\" Sakall and Sydney Greenstreet getting some good moments. This kind of light but worthwhile feature is not as easy as it looks - as witness the string of crass, barely watchable holiday features of recent years. While hardly anything deep or brilliant, \"Christmas in Connecticut\" holds up well enough to be among the more enjoyable movies of its kind. Excellent Christmas-flavoured screwball/romantic comedy that has two of my favourite actors!; I greatly loved this yuletide film, with excellent performances by Barbara Stanwyck and Sydney Greenstreet, and fine direction by Peter Godfrey. Had they a stronger actor in the lead than Dennis Morgan, it would be a perfect film, but it's still a wonderful Christmas perennial and favourite to watch. The Oscar-winning short Star in the Night, directed by Don Siegel and a bonus on this DVD, is even better...Very charming film is more a straight romantic comedy than a Christmas film per se, but any chance to see cinematic greats such as Barbara Stanwyck (especially at this vintage) and, one of the finest character actors ever in Sydney Greenstreet, together is definitely not a lump of coal in a cinephile's Christmas stocking, no-siree! Classic Holiday Movie!; Christmas in Connecticut (1945 - Directed by Peter Godfrey) Barbara Stanwyck stars as a well-known magazine food writer who has been lying to her millions of fans that she is married with child and lives the traditional wife/mother role in a lovely country farm house. Magazine editor Sydney Greenstreet decides that Stanwyck should host returning war veteran Dennis Morgan at her country house over the Christmas holidays! Yikes! What's Stanwyck to do? Why marry her long time suitor, architect John Sloan, (who just happens to have the perfect country house in Connecticut) in a hurry and high tail it out to Connecticut faster than you can say \"I do\" before the boss finds out and she loses her job and becomes the laughing stock of the country. This is a charming and lightly played holiday tale that allows Stanwyck to turn in one of her best comedic roles.  The movie has all the ingredients for a holiday classic: a farm in the country, lots of snow, mishaps and miscommunications to keep everyone guessing as to how the whole thing will turn out in the end. Of course, Stanwyck never does marry her architect friend and instead falls head over heels with the war hero. It's one of the lesser known holiday movies, but year by year, is getting more and more attention.  If you don't go for the heavily sweet holiday fare, this is just what the doctor ordered. Charming &amp; delightful holiday classic; This is a wonderful old fashioned Christmas favorite, which I try to catch on TV every year if I can. It revolves around a Martha Stewart like journalist named Elizabeth Lane, charmingly portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck. However, in contrast to Martha, this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever. The other cast members effectively complete the story, and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley). Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food articles, portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children. In reality, she is a single woman living in a New York City apartment and cannot boil an egg. Her recipes are borrowed from her Hungarian chef friend, Felix. Elizabeth gets away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine, Alexander Yardley, decides he wants a nice old fashioned country Christmas, and invites himself to visit her, bringing with him a returning war hero, Jefferson Jones, a sailor who had been shipwrecked. Yardley demands total honesty of his employees. To get out of her predicament and save her deception based career, Elizabeth borrows the Connecticut country home of her longtime architect suitor, John Sloan, a dull, fussy chap who has long sought marriage. She also borrows a neighbour's baby (actually, several) to pass off as her own and her 'husband' Sloan's. Of course this scenario makes for much merriment. It's a screwball comedy and a charming romance, with the added attraction of a Christmas atmosphere. Whenever I think of this movie, I picture the snowflakes falling, the tree beautifully decorated, the fire roaring in the hearth, the turkey roasting, and Christmas cookies baking. Why did Hollywood feel compelled to do a remake? I understand there is a 1992 version, directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and starring Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson, and Tony Curtis. I have not seen this modern adaptation nor do I wish to. This old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday 'must see' along with It's a Wonderful Life, White Christmas, Miracle on 34th Street, and of course all the versions of A Christmas Carol. Not so hunky dunky; Barbara Stanwyck (Mrs Lane) is a popular journalist on Sydney Greenstreet's (Yardley) magazine who specializes in homely life articles from her farm in Connecticut with her husband and baby. She also tops the charts when it comes to her recipes. War hero Dennis Morgan (Jeff) wins an opportunity to spend Christmas at her farm courtesy of Greenstreet who also invites himself along. How nice. Except Stanwyck is a fraud. She can't cook, she doesn't live on a farm, she doesn't live in Connecticut, she hasn't got a baby and she hasn't got a husband. And she doesn't want to get busted so she needs help to keep up the pretence This has a good premise for comedic situations and Stanwyck is funny in her role, especially when it comes to her baby etiquette. However, there are too many misunderstandings that need resolving and so we regretfully fall into a madcap zany, screwball comedy that gets tedious. By the end of the film you have been willing things to resolve themselves for at least 20 minutes and it has also become complicated. They didn't need so many things going wrong and opportunities for better comedic situations weren't explored as much as they could have been, for example, the arrival of a different baby. That could have been very funny. But, the film became poorly written. Characters also started to grate, especially Uncle SZ Sakall (Felix). He has that cuddly image but he is just annoying. There are funny moments, more so at the beginning as you set out with the film, but I'm afraid the film gets boring. I read one reviewer who said that this film reminded him of \"Holiday Inn\" (1942) only this was funnier. What!!?? He is obviously completely bonkers. Watch \"Holiday Inn\" every time over \"Christmas In Connecticut\". Barbara Stanwyck gets in a flap when asked to find a farm, find a family and flip flapjacks.; A classic farce set against a classically Christmas backdrop, Christmas In Connecticut may be one of those movies that ends up being too nicey nicey and inoffensive for some people (especially in the way that the moral codes of the day are rigidly adhered to while others begin to think that they're being broken) but it remains, for this viewer at least, a real delight and a wonderful light comedy perfect for winter entertainment. Barbara Stanwyck plays Elizabeth Lane, a successful magazine writer who lives on a Connecticut farm with her husband and lovely young child and is just a model housewife and mother, as well as being an amazing cook. Dennis Morgan plays Jefferson Jones, a war hero who is keen to feel just what a traditional home should feel like, and Elizabeth's boss (Alexander Yardley, played by Sydney Greenstreet) arranges for the both of them to spend Christmas with Elizabeth and her family on the farm for Christmas. One small problem - Elizabeth DOESN'T live on a Connecticut farm, she has no husband, has no child and has no talent when it comes to cooking meals (she gets all of her amazing recipes from her friend Felix, played by S. Z. Sakall). Obviously, it's going to be a big job to survive the holiday season. Directed by Peter Godfrey, and with a cracking script by Lionel Houser and Adele Comandini (based on a story by Aileen Hamilton), Christmas In Connecticut starts off by delivering a message of seasonal cheer to the audience and then backs that up with almost every moment of the film's runtime. The cast are all pretty good, with only Reginald Gardiner (as John Sloan, a rather dull architect who helps Elizabeth by letting her into his Connecticut house and arranging to marry her - he even has a baby or two available) being a bit of a damp squib. That's probably as much due to his boring character as it is to the acting but I was always eager to get back to any scenes involving Stanwyck, Morgan, Greenstreet or, especially, Sakall. Even Una O'Connor, an actress I have sometimes found more irritating than amusing, was great fun in this frothy farce. You never really worry that things aren't going to turn out as they should (signposted by a couple of gratuities) and the stress level never overshadows the constant amusement but that's why this is so endearing. It sets out to be a pleasant, entertaining, Christmas comedy and with some great scenes here and there, great characters, some fun lines and plenty of snow, well, that's exactly what it IS. Stanwyck in Top Form in a Holiday Staple After a Slow Start; After excelling as cinema's most malevolent femme fatale - bleached-blonde, anklet-wearing Phyllis Dietrichson - in Billy Wilder's classic 1944 noir, \"Double Indemnity\", Barbara Stanwyck was understandably looking for something lighter to balance out her enduring screen image at the time. Finding instant relief in this 1945 screwball farce that has since become a holiday TV staple, she plays Elizabeth Lane, a popular homemaking magazine writer who doles out Martha Stewart-type cooking advice to the unsuspecting masses who haven't a clue that she's really a lonely working girl who lives in a cold-water Manhattan flat. Things get immediately complicated when her demanding publisher Alexander Yardley, desperate for a boost in circulation, insists that she entertain a wounded soldier who fantasized about her bountiful dishes out in the Pacific. The problem is compounded by the fact that she has completely fabricated her life of domestic bliss on a Connecticut farm where she is supposed to be happily married with a baby. Yardley is not aware of her web of deception, so Elizabeth uses the luxuriant farm owned by her paramour wannabe, John Sloan, whom she agrees to marry in return even though she doesn't love him. She convinces her best friend Felix, a first-class Hungarian chef who has been plying her with his recipes, to come to the farm to give her a crash cooking course. Needless to say, bedlam ensues when the soldier, Jefferson Jones, shows up at the farm two hours early, but of course, so does romance eventually at a local dance and then on a most romantic sleigh ride. Love and truth eventually sort themselves out at the end. In a strange way, one could look at this holiday rom-com as the flip side to \"Double Indemnity\" since both revolve around the concept of a woman fooling others to get her way, but this time, she's a single gal who wants a husband instead of a married one who wants to dispose of one. Directed by Warner Bros. studio journeyman Peter Godfrey and co-written by Lionel Houser and Adele Comandini, the film lacks a certain finesse that an Ernst Lubitsch (\"The Shop Around the Corner\") would have provided in spades. What's more, the initial set-up feels tacked-on with the food-fantasizing Jones first on a life raft with a fellow soldier, then getting rescued, and gradually recovering in the hospital. It runs perilously close to a half-hour before we even get a glimpse of Stanwyck's character. That's a bit of a shame since she's terrifically likable and a game farceur in her typical no-nonsense way. A studio favorite at the time, former band singer Dennis Morgan (\"In This Our Life\") plays the smitten Jones well enough in an undemanding role. The usually menacing Sydney Greenstreet (\"The Maltese Falcon\") has a good time playing the pompous Yardley, and the unforgettable S.Z. \"Cuddles\" Sakall (\"Casablanca\") lives up to his name as Felix. Memorable as the Southern-fried, skirt-blowing chanteuse in \"The Awful Truth\", Joyce Compton plays the nurse who attempts to entrap the food-desperate Jones into marriage. The 2005 DVD includes the original theatrical trailer and an Oscar-winning short, \"Star in the Night\", a then-contemporary retelling of the Nativity story set in the Southwest desert. A True Holiday Classic; Personally, I don't like a lot of b/w movies, but there's something magical about this movie. The movie starts with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). \"Liz\" writes a magazine column about how she's the 'Martha Stewart' of Connecticut. Of course, she's lying. This becomes a problem when her publisher, Mr Yardley, asks her to play host to a NAVY sailor over Christmas. In addition, Mr Yardley, who's going to be alone for Christmas, invites himself up to the farm for the Christmas party. From there, things just go crazy. Since the movie is set on a New England farm, the movie has a warm holiday feeling. Plus, the characters are hilarious. Mr. Yardley is always shouting orders, and Liz's friend Felix is always yelling 'Catastroph!' when things go wrong. Finally, the movie ends the way a Christmas movie should end; a jolly fat man laughs and shouts \"What a Christmas!\" In short, no matter what age you are, you will love this movie. honky donkey!!!; This is my favorite Christmas movie. I love it. I have friends over to watch it. I watch it in June. I'm definitely not a fan of Hollywood propaganda wartime films but this transcends the others. The war is a background to the sweetest holiday film ever made. Stanwyck is great as the slightly unscrupulous writer, Greenstreet is great as her boss, Morgan is incredibly likable, Una O'Connor is Una O'Connor, Gardiner is OK as,I guess,the villain, but for me the star is S.Z Sakall (who refused to have makeup applied to his ears). His lines include: \"She put the watch in his mouth\". \"Kidneys!!!\" \"Now it's goulash\". This is the warmest Christmas film I have ever seen. It's one of the few films where I think, \"I wish I was there.\" The house they are staying in is the perfect Christmas cottage. The meals they prepare are perfect. The whole feeling of the film is the embodiment of Christmas. So to sum up, this film is VERY HONKY DONKEY!!! A delightful Holiday film!; I absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home. The trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a WW2 hero as guests during the Christmas Holidays. Why is she worried? Because she lives in a small New York apartment, isn't married, and doesn't have a baby - and can't cook at all! Hilarity (and romance) ensues when she tries to put on a believable act in an effort to save face/ keep from being fired by the magazine owner (played by Sydney Greenstreet). This is a delightful comedy; one that I highly recommend to classic movie lovers!!!! Fine actors, contrived story; I found this movie disappointing. Which surprised me, because I like most of the actors and they do a decent job here. So what's the problem? Well, it all just seems too contrived. Barbara Stanwyck is fine as the female lead, although I don't see this as one of her outstanding performances (and there were many). Dennis Morgan is pleasant, as he always was; I typically enjoy him in a film. Nice to see Sydney Greenstreet taking one of his lighter roles. Reginald Gardiner, not always one of my favorites, is fine here as the husband to be (?). S.Z. Sakall plays S.Z. Sakall (he was no actor...always played the same role...but was adorable). And, Una O'Connor was as delightful, as always. So, the problem is not the actors. The problem is the script. Sort of a screwball Christmas story...but not quite. Disappointing in terms of romance. It had its funny moments, but not that many moments strung together. The only thing that really comes together in the story are the contrived circumstances. I'm not saying it's a bad movie. It's okay. Pretty average. But as much as I love a good Christmas movie, this just didn't light my Christmas tree. Okay to watch...once. You'll always want to say, as did Santa Claus, Ho, Ho, Ho! after seeing this.; This is a film that truly and nostalgically shows us the America of the 1940's, even as the two great supporting actors, Sydney Greenstreet and S. Z. Sakall hailed from Europe, and the screenplay co-author's parents had gone through Ellis Island. Now for a detail or two. The address of Felix's restaurant was carefully presented as was often the norm at that time: 1. The 300 block is too far away from Fifth avenue. 2. We are not shown if this is East or West from Fifth avenue. 3. The better restaurants are usually in the 50's, not the 40's. That way, you might not be forlornly looking for it. Later on, perhaps for financial reasons, Barbara Stanwyck appeared in a TV western, whatever it was, and so younger viewers may not always know what a great actress she was during the 1940's, the golden age. After seeing this, you might even be wondering, why don't we occasionally have horses and buggies anymore? An Undeservedly Neglected Classic; Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility. The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he exercizes control over his employees -- until the Christmas spirit overtakes him. The role is a 'walk in the park' for Greenstreet who had been one of the stage's great Falstaffs when he was part of the Lunts' company. Greenstreet had only entered films five years earlier when, at age 61, he was featured in what was to become a film classic, the first and best film John Huston ever directed: 'The Maltese Falcon'. 'Cuddles' Sakall was probably never better in his traditional role as the embodiment of middle European gemutlicheit. The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem. Stanwyck the Great; Completely charming comedy not really devised to be a holiday classic and all the better for it. Barbara Stanwyck, coming fresh off of Double Indemnity, is a breezy delight. Of the great studio female stars, Davis, Crawford, Hepburn etc. she was probably the most versatile. She's surrounded by a wonderful cast all experts at what they do. Sydney Greenstreet famous of course as a villain was actually a well known comic stage actor for years before The Maltese Falcon and was always anxious for a chance to show that on screen and he is having fun here. Dennis Morgan is a good match as the romantic lead and he did have a beautiful tenor voice. The situation is a tad incredible but then it's not really meant to be anything serious to begin with. Something to watch to get the holiday spirit without being swamped by all the trimmings. Transporting And Delightful; From the perspective of the hectic, contemporary world in which we live, the so called `good old days' always seem so much more serene and innocent; an idyllic era gone by of which we have only memories and shadows that linger on the silver screen, as with `Christmas In Connecticut,' a warm and endearing film directed by Peter Godfrey.  Barbara Stanwyck stars as Elizabeth Lane, a popular `Martha Stewart' type magazine columnist who writes about life on her beloved farm in Connecticut, always with the latest recipe at the center of the story.  One of her biggest fans is Alexander Yardley, played by Sidney Greenstreet, the publisher of the magazine for which she writes.  Yardley has never visited her farm, and in response to an idea expressed to him in a letter from a nurse, Mary (Joyce Compton), he decides to spend an old fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth, her husband and child and, as a special guest, a certain Mr. Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor just recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his ship was torpedoed.  Elizabeth of course cannot refuse her boss, but there are problems; not the least of which is the fact that she has no farm and writes her column from the comfort of a high-rise in the city.  It makes for a precarious situation for her as well as her editor, Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne), as the one thing Mr. Yardley demands from his employees is total honesty.  What follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that transports the audience back to a seemingly more simple time and place, to share a Christmas Past where a warm hearth, good food and kindness prevail. Barbara Stanwyck absolutely sparkles as Elizabeth, with a smile and presence warmer than anything the grandest hearth could provide, and totally convincing as a city girl entirely out of her element on the farm.  Morgan also fares well as the somewhat naive sailor, whose trust in his fellow man is admirable.  Even with the deceptions being played out around him, he's the kind of guy you know will somehow land on his feet, and in the end it's Elizabeth you really feel for.  One of the true delights of this film, however, is Sidney Greenstreet.  His Yardley has a gruff exterior, but beneath you know without a doubt that this is a man with a heart as big as Texas.  It's a straightforward, honest portrayal, and it's a joy to watch him work; the most memorable scenes in the movie belong to him. The supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), the terrific Una O'Connor (Norah), Frank Jenks (Sinkewicz) and Dick Elliott (Judge Crothers).  A feel-good movie that plays especially well during the Christmas Season (though it would work any time of the year), `Christmas In Connecticut' is a memorable film that never takes itself too seriously, is thoroughly uplifting and will leave you with a warm spot in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be.  It's a true classic, and one you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.  Good morning; Merry Christmas. I hope I'm in time to see you flip the flapjacks.; Christmas in Connecticut (AKA Indiscreet) is out of Warner Brothers and directed by Peter Godfrey. It stars Barbara Stanwyck, Dennis Morgan, Sydney Greenstreet &amp; Reginald Gardiner. Plot sees Stanwyck as Elizabeth Lane, a successful writer of a love, marriage and food column for popular Smart Housekeeping magazine. As far as her readership is aware, Elizabeth lives in domestic bliss out in the country, tending the family home for her husband whilst raising their bonnie baby. The truth, however, is that she doesn't do any of those things, in fact she's hopeless and lives on her own in a modest Manhattan apartment. A problem now since her boss, who is none the wiser, has invited himself and a war hero fan of Elisabeth's writing, to her \"Connecticut\" farm for Christmas. Roping in some friends she hatches a plan to not get found out, but it's not going to be easy to pull off, no sir, not easy at all. Frothy and breezy slice of screwball that does a good enough job at yuletide without really breaking out of its routine chains. Stanwyck is excellent (in a role first offered to Bette Davis), managing to keep the audience on Elizabeth's side in spite of her less than stellar scruples. There's a number of enjoyable set pieces, and enough knock about energy to raise a few laughs. While the makers have nicely played around with the myth of a domestic goddess and the expectation of such from male suitors. The trouble with the film, mainly, is that the direction is not creative enough for the complexities of the story, the deceptions at its core soon become boorish due to overkill. Sure it's lively, but running thru a number of set ups at pace is not enough if the staid dialogue and predictability of it all hangs heavy. One can imagine just what Howard Hawks could have done with this set up. Still, it's a safe recommendation at Christmas time, and certainly a must see for fans of the versatile Stanwyck. But once the end credits have rolled it ultimately feels like a Christmas tree without the trimmings. 6/10 Stanwyck generates a little bit of fun; Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) is a single NYC food writer who is famous for her articles about her fictional Connecticut farm and family. She doesn't know how to cook. Her friend chef Felix Bassenak (S.Z. Sakall) gives her the recipes. The publisher Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) insists that Elizabeth host a Christmas dinner for returning war hero Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan). Her editor Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne) fears being exposed. In desperation, Elizabeth reluctantly agrees to a loveless marriage to the insistent John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner) and somehow get a baby before the dinner. The story is rather boring until Stanwyck starts faking in Connecticut. The war hero isn't very compelling. Dennis Morgan is not that special as a leading man. It takes awhile for the movie to set up the premise and there are no good jokes in that section. The loveless marriage is kinda sad. The movie finally gets to Connecticut after 30 minutes and it takes awhile for the comedy to pick up. Stanwyck has some fun as she fakes a modern-day Martha Stewart starting with changing the baby. Great Holiday Movie -- How About A DVD Release; This is such a wonderful holiday movie and is only available on VHS and during the holiday airings on TCM.  I bring it out every year and watch it several times.  It has a wonderful cast of Hollywood's best including Sydney Greenstreet, S.C. Shagal and Barbara Stanwyck.  Three holidays have passed since I bought my DVD player but yet this movie still has not been released on DVD.  If Warner Brother's still owns the release rights to it...please release it soon on DVD.  Thanks. A must-see Christmas classic!; This is my personal favorite of all the Christmas movies. It's an endearing story, but not sappy. There's plenty of humor, and the characters are smart and witty and work well together. Definitely a house favorite. All the actors show their comedic talents well (especially Barbara Stanwyck), and how can you not love Uncle Felix?! Hunky-dunky! OK, Barbara Stanwyck was quite good; Wasn't anyone else bothered by the fact everyone seems to be having so much fun, but the two mothers of infants were having to work long days, on Christmas eve and Christmas day ? Barbara Stanwyck, as always, was excellent in this type of role. Uncle Felix (SZ Sakall) was really my favorite. A supporting actor who seemed to really get into the part. (Doubt this is really a spoiler) I never did quite get how at the end, Yardley came to accept a less than honest author writing for his magazine. That seemed to be contrary to all of his principles. (This is a spoiler): How in the world did Mary Lee (the nurse) get married, with her former fiancé just gone for the weekend ??? Guess my suspension of disbelief was a little weak for this Christmas movie. Barbara lightens up.; Rating. Eight out of ten. Not a blockbuster, but rather delightful. Barbara's reputation. She is a very tough cookie in other films, and many times portrays quite an unlikeable character. She is not sentimental, in the stereotyped image I have of her. Barbara as a real woman. I remember Barbara in later life, in The Thorn Birds, portraying an elderly woman in love/lust with a young priest (horrors!). She is wealthy, and wants to rule the world of her rural fiefdom. She wants to control her whole world. She, Barbara, is jealous of a younger woman who also lusts after said priest. Elderly Barbara admits that the young priest causes her to melt into jelly, and that, if I remember, she feels she is surely soon going to hell because of her sinfulness. True lies. In this film, Barbara is a fake food columnist for a magazine. She isn't fake, but the food doesn't exist. She is a total klutz in the kitchen. Just imagine if some of today's well known chefs couldn't even boil water or fry an egg. Barbara is nicer here than in some of her other films that people remember. She is even rather naïve here, and almost sympathetic/nice. Swoon. Dennis Morgan was a real hunk. He was a lovely singer, witness his role in My Wild Irish Rose. My fave Jack Carson is missing here, but if competitive Jack had vied for Barbara's hand in this film it would have just been confusing. Dennis and Jack, that irascible pair, would have been totally hilarious playing off each other and opposite Barbara. They could have both been fighting over her. Hope and Crosby knockoffs, indeed. Do a song and dance, Jack and Dennis. The old soft shoe. The feed bag. Dennis' food in the hospital was horrible. His friend's was better. Worse food than Dennis' was the doctor-recommended diet of the Sydney Greenstreet character -- a cardboardish pile of nothingness that Greenstreet abhorred. Was Greenstreet's menu item turnip mousse or soufflé or something like that? Shades of JFK. In this film, Dennis is stuck at sea on a raft after being attacked in World War Two. I am reminded of JFK and his famous similar situation. Consider if JFK had ended up like Dennis's character: crappy food in hospital, while fantasizing about Ms. Perfect Cook from a magazine -- and the bimbos are trying to hook up with him. Sexism: women should not be judged for cooking ability or other outdated marriage qualifications. Let the man learn how to cook. Then he can blame himself for burned meat or boiled over coffee. The woman should not have to wait on the man hand and foot. Rosie doesn't roll up her sleeves. The World War Two stereotype of women is Rosie the Riveter who works in a factory. In this film however, Barbara, the lead woman, actually has a career away from the manufacturing plant. She has a salary, not an hourly wage. Maybe she is a college graduate. Meanwhile, the babies' mothers actually work in factories, from what I remember. They are certainly not the main protagonist of this film. They are in the background, and seldom appear. Two fat men. SZ Sakall was the real chef in this film. It was funny when he called Greenstreet The Fat Man, because Sakall was no Skinny Minnie. It seems Sakall was always somebody's uncle or buffoonish financial adviser. Sydney trying to be an almost lovable curmudgeon. Greenstreet was a mean guy in other films, but here he was actually sort of funny in spots while trying to stay gruff and scary in others. Dennis deft with the infants. The two babies were different than each other. One had dark hair, and one had blonde hair. Morgan had a way with the babies, while Barbara didn't know how to bathe them or do anything else with them for that matter. Eight out of ten. One of my top 5 favorite Christmas movies; While it's not \"perfect\", it's close. Love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Superman's police chief), the housekeeper, the waiter at Restaurant Felix, and the judge......I can go on and on. This movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition since I was a youngster, and my children grew up with it, too! \"The baby swallowed the watch\" was always my son's favorite line. Sexy Barbara Stanwyck in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly, funny S. Z. Sakall. Dennis Morgan has a few great songs, too. I highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake (blah). The Vidiot Reviews...; Christmas in Connecticut When cooking tofurky for Christmas remember to baste it in Nyquil to get that tryptophan feeling. Or, you can do like the journalist in this comedy and tell your cook to do it. Writing bogus copy about her husband, child and Connecticut farmhouse, food columnist Elizabeth (Barbara Stanwyck) must now materialize these lies to host a war-hero (Dennis Morgan) for Christmas dinner - at the behest of her oblivious publisher (Sydney Greenstreet). Marrying a friend (Reginald Gardiner) who owns a country house, hiring a chef (S.Z. Sakall) and borrowing a baby, she plays house with great incompetence. Struggling to maintain her façade, her infatuation with the soldier and the dinner menu, her house of cards starts to crumble. A sophisticated screwball comedy in a picturesque snowy countryside setting, Christmas in Connecticut is a neglected holiday gem. Incidentally, the biggest tell she isn't a real food writer is her sinuous frame. Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca wonderful holiday film that is just sweet; This film reminds me very much of the later Rock Hudson film MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT--about a fishing writer who has NEVER fished and is forced into entering a fishing tournament. In this case, Barbara Stanwyck is a Martha Stewart-like writer who can't cook and doesn't really have the perfect family she describes in her articles--in fact, she has no family at all. Well, like Rock, she is maneuvered into performing--in this case, creating a huge holiday dinner while vacationing in the countryside. Since there is no family, she takes home a veteran and a few friends and tried desperately NOT to \"let the cat out of the bag\" that she can't do any of the things she is known for doing. A cute little comedy and a welcome film to the annual holiday film lineup. a must-see for Christmas!; \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is an absolute gem, and a must-see for Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, a precursor to Martha Stewart, is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakers--the perfect wife, mother, and domestic goddess. Only thing is, she is none of these things--a total phony. Unfortunately for her, she is about to be found out. Her publisher, Mr. Alexander Yardley (a brilliant comic turn by Sydney Greenstreet) gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to Elizabeth's \"perfect farm\" for the Christmas holiday. Only thing, there is no farm, \"perfect\" or otherwise. The comedy involves how Elizabeth is to keep her real identity under wraps so she will not lose her job. Elizabeth's colleague, John, happens to have a farm in Connecticut, so that solves that problem. However, he wants to marry Liz, but she does not want to marry him. He offers her marriage, though he knows she doesn't feel the same way about him that he does about her. He makes the offer anyway, and assures her that he is willing to wait. And here Barbara Stanwyck, as Liz, delivers one of the most devastating put-downs I have ever heard. With perfect innocence, she replies: \"Could you wait that long?\" OUCH! In addition, the scenes between Una O'Conner and S.Z. Sakall are hilarious. They don't seem to like one another (though one suspects they really do). They are rivals in the household, and S.Z. Sakall's mangled English is equaled by Nora's strangled pronunciation of his name (\"Mr. Basternook\"). \"My name is FELIX!\" It is amazing how Christmas-y these black and white films are. Great character work by all involved. Don't miss this one! My Mother's Favorite Holiday Movie; My mother loved Barbara Stanwyck; in fact it was the only reason we watched \"The Big Valley\". But while \"The Big Valley\" was pure crap, \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is a heartwarming, fun little movie that I watched with my mother every year in the 80's and early 90's. Now it's difficult to find anywhere. I wonder why? The gorgeous Miss Stanwyck was as good as usual, and all the other players are great. It ranks right up there with \"White Christmas\" as a true holiday classic. They should bring it back where it belongs. A Yuletide Man's Favorite Sport; It finally hit me watching my VHS of Christmas in Connecticut what other film this one reminded me of. If it weren't for the fact that the other was done 20 years later, I'd say it was a remake. Just as Rock Hudson was a phony fishing expert for Abercrombie&amp;Fitch who had to get some on the job training at a fishing tournament, Barbara Stanwyck plays an forties version of Martha Stewart. Stanwyck's a cooking columnist who's built up this whole image of living on a small Connecticut farm with husband and baby cooking all these marvelous delicacies. Trouble is she's unmarried, childless, writes her column from her apartment in New York and doesn't know how to boil water. But her writing is a hit with the public. Trouble comes when she's hijacked into cooking a home Christmas dinner for a war hero sailor played by Dennis Morgan who gets to sing a couple of songs as well. Got to keep up the image at any cost. And her publisher Sidney Greenstreet likes the idea so well that he invites himself to the dinner. So with borrowed farm, baby, and Reginald Gardiner who'd like to make it real with Stanwyck she tries to brazen it through. Christmas in Connecticut's now a Yuletide classic and deservedly so. The leads are warm and human and they get great support from the assembled players. S.Z. Sakall as the Hungarian restaurant owner/friend of Stanwyck from whom she gets her cooking information and Una O'Connor as the housekeeper have a nice chemistry between them. Reginald Gardiner and Stanwyck have no chemistry at all, obvious to all but Reggie and he's funny in his stuffed shirt way. Most people remember this film as one of Sidney Greenstreet's few ventures into comedy. If he's not an outright villain, a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon, Greenstreet is few other things on screen. Christmas in Connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to burlesque his own image and he made the most of it. In a biography of Barbara Stanwyck, she mentions she enjoyed making Christmas in Connecticut as a welcome change from some villainous parts like Double Indemnity she'd been doing recently. One of the things that made doing the film so enjoyable was that between takes, director Peter Godfrey and Greenstreet would do some impromptu entertaining of cast and crew with English Music Hall numbers. Made for a relaxed and warm set and the cast responded accordingly. Now if only someone had been filming those numbers. Christmas in Connecticut; Spunky, fun Christmastime balderdash has popular magazine article writer Barbara Stanwyck stuck in the predicament of hosting a faux Christmas Eve/Day homemaking extravaganza for her boss (Sydney Greenstreet) and a war hero (Dennis Morgan) who survived (along with a fellow soldier/pal) on a raft on the ocean for several days without food",
       "the problem is she isn't the amazing cook, sensational mother, and superb farm-marm that leaps from the pages of her articles. The real cook with all the gourmet dishes isn't Stanwyck but SZ Sakall from Budapest who is fortunate enough to benefit from her fame. Sakall will accompany her to a farm supplied by architect Reginald Gardiner (he is always habitually asking Stanwyck to marry him) if Stanwyck will marry him. Reluctantly, she will but her betrothal to Gardiner keeps getting delayed by Sakall who knows she doesn't love him. The child is brought by to be babysat by a mother who works at the war factory (female one day, but the next is a different worker with a male baby!), so Stanwyck (who doesn't know a thing about being a mother) must wing it, aided (much to her delight) by Morgan (he grew up with children and knows how to bath and feed them). The problem that arises for Stanwyck is that she falls head-over-heels for Morgan and must somehow steer her affections/lust for him away and focus on successfully fooling Greenstreet into believing she is actually exactly as she claims. The whole comic angle is Stanwyck masterminding this grand charade even as her behavior and heart yearn for Morgan. Greenstreet expects what he reads in her articles to be articulated in person and Stanwyck must find ways to escape. This is designed like a screwball comedy or something you might see from Preston Sturges. There's constant activity, evasive maneuvers, close-calls, daunting tasks demanding think-on-your-feet (or just plain luck) responses, lots of wooing and romanticizing, and unexpected developments (baby is \"kidnapped\" by his actual mom much to Greenstreet's dismay; the male-female baby change; Greenstreet expecting Stanwyck to \"skillet a flapjack\" in his presence; the \"theft\" of a horse carriage that lands Morgan and Stanwyck temporarily under arrest) that complicate matters further. Stanwyck had a magnetic screen presence even in films like this that feel like holiday, feel-good fodder, perhaps considered a notch or two behind the Lady Eves and Ball of Fires, but I thought \"Christmas in Connecticut\" would be easy to go down with some eggnog and cookies. It has that holiday atmosphere (the farm is idyllic and snowy, the house is elegant, there's the decoration of the gigantic Christmas tree, the piano-played carol, and the cast are breezy and fun to watch). When you are needing something Christmassy for a night in December, this is as entertaining a film as I could recommend",
       "it has all the ingredients without schmaltz or melodramatics. All the parts fit to make this comedy romance a Christmas classic; Some classical stories (novels) have been so popular for so long, that they are remade into movies every so many years. The stories remain virtually unchanged, but the cast, script and sets change. The most obvious of these is Charles Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol.\" That literary and holiday classic lends itself very well to new productions, much like the works of Shakespeare. On the other hand, some specific movies have become favorite classics or are so part of our annual traditions that the casts have become ingrained in the stories. One can't see anyone else playing certain roles. One of the most obvious of these is Frank Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" We can't imagine anyone other than James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, and Henry Travers playing the roles they had in that film. \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is another such film. Although it hasn't reached the stature of Wonderful Life, this film has become a holiday classic as well. It is a favorite of mine. Those of us who have seen it a number of times over the years can't imagine anyone other than those in its cast playing the roles in the film. Barbara Stanwyck is Elizabeth Lane, Dennis Morgan is Jefferson Jones, Sydney Greenstreet is Alexander Yardley, S.Z. 'Chuckles' Sakall is Uncle Felix, and Reginald Gardiner is John Sloan. Even beyond the main cast, some supporting actors are so good and right for their roles, that they have become 'ingrained' in the parts. These include Una O'Connor as Norah, Dick Elliott as Judge Crothers, and Robert Shayne as Dudley Beecham. This movie came out less than a month before Japan's surrender and the end of World War II. It was nearly 1 ½ years ahead of \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" There are no war scenes in \"Christmas in Connecticut,\" but the war had a strong influence and part in the plot of the film. The war that had ended had nothing to do with the plot of \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" While both films have Christmas settings, their stories and intended audiences are quite different. \"It's a Wonderful Life\" is all family entertainment, with strong seasonal appeal to children as well as adults and strong moral and human overtones. \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is a very good romantic comedy that is adult all the way. It's approved viewing for children as well  very clean and proper. But the humorous script and sequences are written for adults. It doesn't have tremendously clever dialog with witty wisecracks and comebacks. Rather, it has clever lines that fit visual situations. The film has some hilarious sequences. Watch for Uncle Felix, Elizabeth and Sloan at the buffet table in the restaurant. Another is at Alexander Yardley's home, between him and Elizabeth  and then the butler and Elizabeth. Judge Crothers pops in and out of scenes in a funny sort of cat-and-mouse series of scenes. Then there's the Connecticut square dance. And Yardley's dialog with Sloan about the former's ability to detect lies and fraud. The farm cow plays in another humorous sequence. Elizabeth and Jones have a wonderful sequence, warm and funny, with the baby. Later, the baby switches lead to all sorts of mayhem and humor. There are more, from the opening scenes of two sailors adrift after their ship is torpedoed, to the very end. I noted some reviewers thought the plot was too contrived or silly. I think it's an excellent plot, very well contrived, with several specific twists that fit together perfectly to make it work. This is not an uproariously funny film. It's a warm, entertaining romantic comedy. Its turns with the truth, marriage, fidelity and other virtues are obvious to an adult audience. So, we don't take them as serious but as part of the humor of the plot. Nor is this a film of funny characters. Stanwyck, Greenstreet and Morgan are mostly straight characters, although Greenstreet has some very humorous dialog in a couple places. The only standout humorous role is that of Uncle Felix. To a lesser degree, Norah and Dud are comedic roles. The comedy is mostly in the lines of these three characters, and in the physical responses and scenes with the others. To that extent, Stanwyck and Greenstreet are especially good in their straight roles that lend to the comedy. Greenstreet is a riot as the prudent overseer of morals and propriety of his columnist employee, Elizabeth. This is a most enjoyable film. Its transparent plot seems very straightforward. Yet I seem to discover something new to enjoy each time I watch this movie. I heartily recommend it for anyone who hasn't yet seen it. One viewing should suffice to make it a part of your annual Christmas holidays list. Here are a few snippets of the fun and funny dialog that I enjoy. Elizabeth, \"Dud, we're going to be married.\" Dud, \"What? Hey, now, look here Elizabeth, it isn't that bad.\" John, \"Oh, really, Beecham.\" Judge Crothers, \"I suppose you'll give the bride away, Uncle Felix?\" Felix, \"Me  I don't give nobody away. Always, I keep my mouth shut.\" Butler, \"Pardon me, Mrs. Lane. \"I'm planning on having a farm in Connecticut myself one day. I'd like some good bottomland.\" Mrs. Lane, \"Bottomland?\" Butler, \"Yes. That's the best for farming, isn't it?\" Mrs. Lane, \"Oh, some people say yes, and some people say no.\" Butler, \"But what do you say?\" Mrs. Lane, \"Uh, I'm inclined to agree with them.\" Butler, \"Oh, thank you very much.\" The Best Holiday Movie; It's fun and fast paced, as one falsehood leads to another and another toward an inevitable, surprising conclusion.  The suspense separates this Holiday flick from all others.  One wonders how the pieces are going to fit, both during the movie and in the future. The character actors laid the foundation and entertained us in the process. Sinkewicz (Frank Jenks) shows us what manipulation can get...and ultimately what manipulation can cost!  Uncle Felix (S.Z. Sakall) sizes up each person for us while trying to protect \"Lishka\" (Barbara Stanwyck), and this helps us decide who we are going to root for in the end. If we could ever achieve a perfect world, imperfect people would likely have to undergo a series of events such as these. A glaring weakness is that fake baby cry after it allegedly swallowed Uncle Felix's watch.  I've heard more authentic crying from a doll in a toy store. Watch it, and you'll really feel like you've been somewhere! The Moonlight and the Snow",
       "and the Cow; The destroyer of Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan) and his partner Sinkewicz (Frank Jenks) is sunk by the Germans and they float adrift in a raft for eighteen days. When they are rescued, they are sent to a hospital and Jefferson has to follow a stringent diet imposed by the doctors. He seduces his nurse expecting to get solid food and she decides to write to Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet), who is the owner of the Smart Housekeeping magazine where the famous journalist Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) writes a column about recipes and food, asking him to allow Jefferson to spend Christmas with Elizabeth and her family in her farm in Connecticut. The prepotent Yardley sees the chance of free promotion of his magazine and forces Elizabeth to invite the hero Jones. However, Elizabeth is single, does not have a baby and lives alone in a small apartment in New York and she made-up a perfect married life for her fans. Further, she does not how to cook and the recipes belong to her Hungarian friend Felix Bassenak (S.Z. Sakall), who owns a restaurant in New York. The architect John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner), who has been wooing Elizabeth for a long, proposes to marry her in his farm in Connecticut and she brings Felix with her to help to proceed the farce. The things get complicated when Yardley also decides to spend Christmas with Elizabeth while she falls in love with Jones. \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is a delightful and witty comedy of errors about a famous food writer that makes up a fictitious life and has guests to her world. I have just bought this DVD and it was the perfect entertainment for a rainy Sunday afternoon, with hilarious situations and wonderful performances. \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is indeed a must- see for the Christmas period. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): Not Available Christmas Great; Christmas in Connecticut (1945) *** (out of 4) Delightful comedy about a female journalist (Barbara Stanwyck) who writes a column claiming to be a great wife, mother and cook. Things get out of control when her boss (Sydney Greenstreet) invites a WW2 vet (Dennis Morgan) over to her farm for Christmas. The problem is that Stanwyck is single and doesn't really know how to cook so now she must try and push the scam over. This is a highly delightful, charming and cute little film that isn't too heavy but isn't too light either. This is my favorite role I've seen from Stanwyck who manages to be tough yet charming as well. The real benefit to the film is the wonderful supporting performances by Greenstreet, Morgan, S.Z. Sakall, Robert Shayne and Una O'Connor. The romance side of the film works perfectly and the film contains many classic scenes including the babies bath as well as the cow getting loose. The only problem is the final twenty-minutes take too long to play out. Just Use the Old Magoo; \"Christmas in Connecticut\" isn't exactly the best Christmas movie (Seriously, how many Christmas movies are really *that* good?  Even \"It's a Wonderful Life\" is pretty schmaltzy and manipulative when you think about it), but it does the trick.  It's cute and gets a little bit more enjoyable every year I see it.  The Christmas angle seems kind of thrown in--almost as if someone at Warner Bros. said, \"Hey, we can get this thing released in December rather than January if we just rewrite a little of it and set it at Christmas.\" Anyway, don't pass up \"It's a Wonderful Life\" or \"A Christmas Story\" for this one, but I'd recommend it just the same. Remember:  The Magoo will get you in, and the Magoo will get you back out. Snow-White Lies; Let's hear it for serendipity: In a shop specializing in Region 1 dvds I stumbled across one of those pantechnicon boxed sets, this one featuring four Christmas-themed movies. The selling point in my case was The Shop Around The Corner, which I have seen several times on TV but never owned and the set also boasted three other titles that were either new to me (It Happened on Fifth Avenue) or titles of which I'd heard of but hadn't seen, like this one. Okay the leading man was something of an acting joke, wooden as both Punch and Judy combined, but Barbara Stanwych seldom lets you down and if she was having an off-day here (she wasn't) Sydney Greenstreet, S. Z. Zackall, Regineld Gardiner and Una O'Connor were running interference and there was no way they could all be lousy at the same time. The premise was that Stanwyck plays a character based loosely upon Gladys Taber who, for several decades wrote a column in Family Circle in which she did little more than chat in a homely way - and/or dispensed 'Butternut Wisdom' about her farm in Connecticut, lacing the text with recipes, gardening tips etc. The twist in the film is that Stanwyck writes her column from Manhattan, couldn't boil water without burning it, would require an illustrated recipe to make toast and relies on the expertise of restaurateur Zackall to provide the cooking tips/recipes. She's doing all right if anybody asks you until the owner of the magazine, Greenstreet, decides not only to spend Christmas on the fictitious Stanwyck farm but also to bring war hero Morgan to supply the human interest angle. Luckily Regineld Gardiner, who has been pursuing Stanwyck unsuccessfully for years, just happens to have a farm in Connecticut which he is prepared to 'lend' Stanwyck should she agree to marry him, and naturally there is room also for Zackall to do the cooking. Now, of course, it's just a matter of waiting to see how long Stanwyck can keep the balls in the air, or how many near-misses she can survive. There's a lot of charm at work here and it's sobering to think that in 1945 this could have easily got lost in the shuffle at a time when they were churning out stuff like this at the rate of half a dozen a year whilst today it beckons like an oasis in a desert of mediocrity. Highly recommended. Old fashioned Christmas romance with a \"modern woman\" touch; I have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites...it has all the charm, 1940's quaintness, and good old fashioned romance and it's hilarious, to boot! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking\\home life articles for a famous magazine...under the premise that she is a married homemaker. Even the president of the magazine is under this delusion. Enter a handsome GI, (played by the talented Dennis Morgan)just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy. His simple wish is to stay at the homey Inn the she writes so eloquently about and relax with her famous home-cooked meals. She now has to frantically find a way to save her job and reputation...add to this that her fiancé is in a hurry to tie the knot doesn't help. The humor is superb and the chemistry between the leading characters a lot of fun. Throw in the character-actor nicknamed \"Cuddles\" (who fits this name completely) it becomes even more adorable. This has become my must-see movie that I snuggle in with a cup of cocoa each Christmas season. A wonderful, enjoyable movie to enjoy at Christmastime or anytime! Despite the Christmas theme, the film is really about the pressures on a single woman to marry...; Nationally-read woman columnist, an ace cook and homemaker on a farm in the country, is in reality a single gal in the city who relies on her restaurateur uncle to create all her recipes. After a handsome war hero expresses interest in her dishes, a publicity meeting is devised, wherein the columnist must whip up a rural home, a husband, a baby, and a cow! Highly concocted scenario with an unlikely set-up is just about saved by Barbara Stanwyck's smart, assured performance in the lead and some funny business from the supporting players. There's far too much confusion in the third act, with incidental characters (and babies!) entering and exiting excitedly, and Sydney Greenstreet is saddled with the impossible role of Barbara's publisher, the nosiest old busybody in the cinema! Still, there's a sweet (if ready-made) romance between Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan...and when the picture settles down and allows them to talk naturally like real people, the results are wonderfully engaging. **1/2 from **** classic but dated; Nostalgia is the primary reason to view this film. The plot is too cute, the storyline too improbable and the comedy not particularly funny. I think there may have been perhaps two or three times I smiled but most of time thought a well made for TV flick is more entertaining. However, if you like Barbara Stanwyck and want to return to a more innocent, naive time devoid of faxes, computers, etc. this film is for you. Actually the cast does quite a good job with the lines they have to deliver but most of the plot points elicit groans rather than guffaws. The home in which most of the action takes place is very impressive, but like the plot, unrealistic. Most people, even today, don't live this good. The film is a fantasy, but so over the top it simply no longer works. An annual must-see; Forget Jimmy Stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead.  I suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and Stanwyck's other great Christmas story, \"Meet John Doe\" aren't revered with the same level of love as...well, you know it's name. Stanwyck plays a food writer for a McCall's-type rag who has been lying for years to her pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes.  She's an ace b.s. artist until the day Morgan's sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days afloat &amp; 6 weeks recuperation in a Navy hospital.  Released the last year of WWII, the film is dusted with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia but never sinks to sentimentality.  Stanwyck is sexy and sassy as always and meets her match in the hunky Morgan with whom it's love at first sight.  Unfortunately, she has to play married to Gardiner's prissy architect who actually has been seeking her hand for years at his farm in CT, just to fool her boss. S.Z. Sakall adds a great deal of Hungarian malaprop &amp; double-entendre humor in support as Babs' true source of culinary talent &amp; Una O'Connor is hilarious as Gardiner's obnoxious Irish housekeeper. Another Christmas Classic \"Found\" on TCM!; Like \"It Happened on 5th Avenue\", I never saw this movie until TCM showed it at Christmas time! Nobody else shows black &amp; white movies! Like 5th Ave, it revolves around an ex-serviceman and love at first sight. A \"Betty Crocker-Martha Stewart\" type magazine columnist writes about her lovely country home and down-home recipes. She is a complete fraud as she lives in a NYC apartment and gets all her cooking tips from her Hungarian restaurant owner \"Felix\", very well played by character actor S.Z. \"Cuddles\" Sakal. So, Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) gets caught in a lie and has to fabricate the whole thing, right down to the country ranch, husband and baby. All fake. She's single, childless, and lives in the city. Along comes a Navy hero who gets invited to her \"home for the holidays\". She can't even boil water, so \"Felix\" tries to teach her to cook, complete with flapjacks stuck on the ceiling! As mentioned, she falls in love with the Navy guy and the movie becomes even better. The sub-plots include her overpowering magazine boss (Sidney Greenstreet), a friend who she almost mistakenly marries, and a borrowed baby who changes sexes and hair colors! It's a \"screwball\" comedy. Great fun for all and highly recommended! The film runs a bit rough on both TCM and the DVD. Horizontal \"wobble\" and minor film damage for the first 20 minutes. It must have been hard to restore! There is also a 1992 TV remake with Dyan Cannon out there, but the original is far better. Excellent screwball comedy; This is a screwball comedy disguised as a Christmas movie. I almost prefer Barbara Stanwyck in this than in the Lady Eve. She is a bit less restrained, a bit warmer. She moves with ease in an almost all male cast. The holiday theme is almost incidental, it definitely takes a sideline to the charade in the house of her being a domestic goddess. Barbara Stanwyck carries the movie right through to the end. Her extra slim figure is pleasing in very simply tailored clothes. Your heart almost sinks for her when she is going to be married to the very droll architect. The actual farm setting is fun and makes it more believable. Not very well known, but not to be missed. The best Christmas gift one can receive!; This Christmas gift arrived courtesy of TCM. We had never seen the film, even though we have seen most of the films of Barbara Stanwyck. This comedy made us laugh so much, that at times, we had to restrain ourselves, in order to hear the dialog. This is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations, especially around Christmas. It would certainly lift one's spirits by just letting go. The movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a DVD, or a VHS tape. \"Christmas in Connecticut\" was directed with great panache by Peter Godfrey, based on a story by Aileen Hamilton. The best thing in the movie is the felicitous pairing of two of the most popular stars of that era: Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan. Barbara Stanwyck always played strong willed women, obviously, this was a change of pace for her. In this film, as well as \"Lady Eve\", Ms. Stanwyck displays a knack for comedy. She and Mr. Morgan, who played in a lot of musical comedies, make a winning combination. There are no weak performances in the film. Sydney Greenstreet, an actor notorious for playing 'heavies', is a delight to watch as the rich, and fat, Alexander Yardley, the man who owned a media empire and who knew a good thing when he saw it. Reginald Gardiner, an accomplished English actor, adds luster to the stellar cast behind the two principals. S. Z. Sakall, is another source of continuous mirth; he plays the Hungarian chef Felix,who has a hard time with his own version of the English language. Also, Una O'Connor makes a perfect Norah, the housekeeper in the Sloan perfect Connecticut farm. In reading other comments in this forum, it's sad to learn that the glorious black and white cinematography is not appreciated by some people. After all, color was not widely used in the 40s, and most of the classic movies have to be seen in its original format because, what would be accomplished in 'coloring' them? This film should be a requirement for anyone looking to spend almost two hours of uninterrupted fun at Christmas time because total merriment is assured. Watch it with an open mind and heart an maybe you'd like to see \"Christmas in Connecticut\" every year. Stanwyck &amp; Comedy Do Not A Perfect Yuletide Combo Make; If nothing else, this decidedly silly, light-weight RomCom from 1945 will certainly entice you with all of its talk (as well as its presentation) of food-glorious-food. Your mouth will water at the sight of some of the delectable meals that are placed before your famished eyes. But, with that said, I found this somewhat screwy Chick Flick wasn't exactly the sort of cold-climate story that's guaranteed to warm your heart, nor put you into the Christmas spirit, or anything like that, at all. But, still, this film does have its entertaining moments, even though its plot was just a wafer-thin \"Girl-Gets-Boy-To-The-Altar\" story with a predictable, token \"happy ending\" conveniently tacked on for good measure. This piece of airy fluff has Barbara Stanwyck playing character Elizabeth Lane, a chic, NYC writer for Smart Housekeeping magazine, who's got her naive readers believing her to be the most ideally perfect homemaker on the face of the planet (but, in reality, she's far from being that). This standard studio corn has Miss Lane cornered into entertaining both a dashing, young war veteran and her overbearing boss in a cozy, but posh, Connecticut home for the holidays. Filmed in b&amp;w, this offering from Warner Bros. has a running time of 100 minutes. To Spend Christmas in Connecticut; I've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise. A Christmas Classic,it's also one of the fine comedies of the 40s. The story line is simple : Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine. At Christmas time, her boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the Connecticut farm she write about. The only problem is : She hasn't got any farm and she can't cook. To get out of the jam, Elisabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend (Reginald Gardiner,who has a farm) and flies for Connecticut with her wonderful cook Uncle Felix. There's a fine direction by Peter Godfrey and the cast is really wonderful : Stanwyck has never been better as this witty and yet romantic woman. Greenstreet, Gardiner and Sakall make hilarious and human supporting characters. The only weak point is the leading man, Dennis Morgan. He starts well but as the movie goes on, becomes really a bore. One almost feels sorry for Elisabeht Lane to ends up with him rather than with Gary Cooper or David Niven who both would have been more suitable for the part. Anyway, this is a joyful Christmas time movie with a refreshing score and I advice it to everyone who likes to spend funny and sweet Holidays...in Connecticut. Holiday Screwball; A magazine columnist who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a NY apartment must come up with a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, it turns into an entertaining little screwball comedy, thanks to a fine cast. In a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in \"Double Indemnity,\" Stanwyck displays a nice comedic flair. Morgan is smooth as the affable war hero while Greenstreet is well cast as the publisher. However, Sakall steals the film as a chef trying to master the English language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible European accent. A film full of holiday fun!; Make sure you make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season! If you admire Dennis Morgan or Barbara Stanwyck, this film is a fun one to watch. They really work well together as you would see in this movie. The whole cast was very entertaining. Since I'm a Dennis Morgan fan, this film was a real treat! But...everyone can enjoy it! Recommended! Great Romantic Christmas Movie!!!; I came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday films. As you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed on for it. Stanwyck is great as bride to be that is having second thoughts. Dennis Morgan's acting is strong also. He goes unnoticed in most films but was a very capable actor, check out KITTY FOYLE. In this film he plays the visiting sailor that woos Stanwyck away from her husband to be. This is a Christmas classic. The settings and the story make for a great Christmas romance Stanwyck and Morgan team up with a great cast; Every time, I see Barbara Stanwyck I am more impressed with her acting, whether in a dramatic or comedy role. Her talent combined with her beauty make any of her movies hard to pass up. In this holiday film, Christmas in Connecticut, she is delightfully paired with Dennis Morgan and the incomparable Sydney Greenstreet and a wonderful supporting cast that includes Una O'Connor and S.Z. Sakall. The story is about a New York columnist who pretends to live in a Connecticut country home as the perfect wife and mother. Her publisher, Sydney Greenstreet, unaware of the truth, is a man who likes the image that she uses because it appeals to his readership and sells newspapers; however, he too is seduced by the image and invites himself to spend a Christmas in Connecticut to enjoy the pleasures of a New England country Christmas. He is joined by Dennis Morgan, home from the war, where he was just rescued at sea. This is where the plot becomes complicated for Stanwyck and her male friend, Reginald Gardiner, who poses as her husband. They are forced to construct a front of domestic bliss in Connecticut with servants, livestock and children brought in as props to complete the image for the publisher's Christmas holiday. Dennis Morgan is superb as the war vet and when paired with Stanwyck, there is a real chemistry between them that leads to further complications. We find some amusing situations, as the facade unravels with babies, boyfriends and farm animals all playing a role in the hilarious Connecticut household. Morgan and Stanwyck find themselves in an awkward situation and Greenstreet starts to question Stanwyck's respectability as a wife and mother. This is one Christmas movie that Christmas movie fans should see - amusing and well-acted holiday entertainment. Reality? Who needs it?; This is how people killed time before they invented television. It is called a \"B movie,\" the companion in a double feature to the movie people were actually willing to pay money for. You didn't worry over little details like making the story believable; these stories exist in an alternative B movie universe. And so we see in the opening two sailors adrift for 16 days. The nurse says they were without food for 16 days, yet in the next breath she talks about how they had K rations, up to some point. Jeff gave his companion the last of the K rations, and now he is being kept off solid food for 18 days, while his buddy has been feasting on steak and turkey for days. Does this make sense? So how does the Nurse Sadist console him? She reads him a magazine article about a seven-course meal, complete with roast duck, after serving him warm milk and a raw egg! In my universe, he would have strangled her, but in the B universe, the sailor pretends to fall in love with Nurse Sadist. (Now, in reality, when liberating Nazi concentration camps, doctors found that if starving inmates were fed high protein food right off, they died because the kidneys were overloaded. So they started them out on a light broth, etc., for a couple of days.) And these are the problems with just the first six minutes of the movie. By eight minutes, the nurse is ready to marry him and is bringing him steak, and all he did was say her name and that he missed her. Now, why didn't any of the other dozens of sailors in the ward think of that with such a dumb blond (she can't even win at tic tack toe)? Sure, you've got to be willing to suspend disbelief, but for an old B movie, this is easier if you aren't exactly paying attention to the movie, if you know what I mean. In the year 2013, what this means is this is a chick flick, a suitably romantic movie to watch with a brainless girlfriend. At 12 minutes, just when many in the theater are about to put on their coats, Sidney Greenstreet appears, and the plot thankfully thickens. At 14 minutes, we have two more stars, and the first of two black actors in small but non-stereotyped roles. We are beginning to see the DNA of this Christmas movie: a Warner Bros. picture, the rebel outfit. Underlying the story are jabs at more conventional movies like Holiday Inn - 1942, also set on a farm in Connecticut, and Meet John Doe - 1941, A Frank Capra flick which also features Barbara Stanwyck as a mink coat wearing reporter who concocts bogus stories. And there is a jab at a real life food writer, Gladys Taber. This is what people watched before TV, and after, for the B movie became the basis for brainless sitcoms; from these humble roots sprung such masterpieces as I Remember Lucy, The Beverly Hillbillies and Gilligan's Islands. Perhaps that's why this storyline seems so hackneyed: 60 subsequent years of TV sitcoms. Realty? A most inconvenient distraction. Call me old fashioned, but I believe there should be some sort of internal logic to a movie's plot. In Christmas in Connecticut, there's none. Things just happen, mostly for the convenience of the lazy writers, especially the ending. (Spoiler alert) It makes no sense, but everyone seems to be happy, or at least relieved, as far as I can tell. It is a bit confusing because the writers just tie up a bunch of loose ends with some very fast dialog - The End. Hey, if you enjoyed the movie, if it made your Christmas merrier, that's great. But if you've never seen this movie, you haven't missed anything. And aside from the fact that they say it is Christmas, there is nothing particularly Christmassy about this movie. Heck, it came out on August 11, four days before the Japanese surrender. Actually, this is a bit odd, when you think about it. Until they dropped the atomic bombs on Japan, it looked like the war would run another year or two. With the war over, showing this movie in Dec. 1945 would seem dated, especially as people would be tired of thinking about it. Just another of many elements about this movie that don't quite fit. Yes, that's good!; Charming film, funny, and leaves you with a real feel-good feeling.  Does anybody know why all those babies in 1940's films look so . . . well, homely? I like S.Z. Sakall (spelling?), and I LOVED the part where he asks the African-American waiter if \"catastrophe\" is good.  The waiter's reply is so intelligent, you just know he's going to med school nights on the GI bill or something.  This is something simply not seen in films of this era, and it floors me every time.  I wish it could have happened more often . . . \"Are you crazy? Where am I gonna get a farm?\"; For the longest time I thought I'd already seen this picture, but reading the cast list when it appeared on a cable channel listing, I realized that wasn't so. I must have been thinking \"Holiday Inn\", having a similar style setting and taking place in Connecticut. Both also have a story that defies credibility, though this one has more humorous elements to make it a fun, breezy offering. Veteran actors step out of their usual film personas to create interesting characters here. Barbara Stanwyck usually goes for the strong willed woman type while Sydney Greenstreet often portrays a more somber character. I don't know how many times it might have happened, but this is the second time Greenstreet happened to be called a 'fat man' in a picture. He had the same distinction as Signor Ferrari in \"Casablanca\", a movie in which S.Z Sakall also appeared doing a humorous bit similar to the one he performs here as Felix Bassenak. You know, I think the screen writers missed an opportunity when they brought in the second baby to confound the guests at the Sloan residence. Wouldn't it have been neat if Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan) had to change the baby one more time and discovered that he had a spare part? Why didn't they think of that? Well as holiday films go, this one skirts the idea by virtue of taking place around Christmas time, but the tree is in place with the presents underneath, and even offers up \"Oh Little Town of Bethlehem\" as one of the musical offerings. If you decide to tune in, don't get mixed up like me and confuse it with other holiday flicks that show up around the same time of year. Especially when the opening scene begins the story on a German submarine! Lies, Lies And More Lies; There were so many classic movies that were made where the leading people were out-and- out liars and yet they are made to look good. I never bought into that stuff. The \"screwball comedies\" were full of that stuff and so were a lot of the Fred Astaire films. Here, Barbara Stanwyck plays a famous \"country\" magazine writer who has been lying to the public for years, and feels she has to keep lying to keep her persona (and her job). She even lies to a guy about getting married, another topic that was always trivialized in classic films. She's a New York City woman who pretends she's a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies, etc. Obviously she knows nothing and the lies pile up so fast you lose track. I guess all of that is supposed to be funny because lessons are learned in the end and true love prevails, etc. etc. Please pass the barf bag. Most of this film is NOT funny. Stanwyck was far better in the film noir genre. As for Dennis Morgan, well, pass the bag again. Christmas nostalgia with perfect dialog; This is our favorite Christmas movie, and we watch it every year. Actually, Christmas is kind of incidental. There is nothing religious or Santa Claus related about it, although there is a prominent Christmas tree in the living room, and Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) has trouble decorating it; also, the war hero, Jeff (Dennis Morgan), sings a Christmas song at one point. It is definitely winter, though, in all its Hollywood splendor. There's realistic-looking snow galore and horses and sleighs to glide through it. The event sequences are pretty incredulous, but this is a farce, and farces are not supposed to be believable. What I like most is the acting -- all of the actors are perfect for their parts -- and the dialog. The dialog sequences fit together like a perfect puzzle. There is one hilarious scene after another, and the fast pace never stops until the end. While the final result is not surprising, the way it's carried out is. Besides Stanwyck playing off Morgan, there's an interesting relationship between Uncle Felix (S.Z. Sakall) and Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet), two outstanding actors who also played in Casablanca. Sakall is an excellent character actor who is not that well known, but I hope to find him in more movies. Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide only gives this movie 2.5 stars, but I think it is worth at least 3.5, if not 4, stars as one of the most hilarious 40's comedies and an excellent Christmas season film. Christmas in August; It was interesting to watch a holiday movie in August. I do think these stories should air year round and not just in December. I had never seen Christmas IN CONNECTICUT all the way through. Well, now, I finally have. I found myself focusing on S.Z. Sakall's performance as Felix the cook-- you know, the guy who says \"everything is hunky-dunky!\" But in addition to Sakall, the rest of the cast shines too-- and it's obvious they were all having fun making this film. There's a lot of screwball comedy here, and the dialogue is just so intentionally silly in spots that you can't help but love it. Sakall's scenes with Stanwyck are quite good, but his scenes with Greenstreet are even better. And there's a scene at his restaurant early in the film where he walks around and doesn't have dialogue. If you watch that part carefully, you will see a great bit of improvisation. Truly one of the best character actors in Hollywood during the 1940s. Very enjoyable film.; I have seen this film several times and never tire of it. It is a witty and clever film and does not need sex or violence to make up for a lack of talent. The whole family can view it and simply enjoy it. A charming old-fashioned Christmas movie with modern 40's ideals.; Barbara Stanwyck probably didn't think of it, but it is a relief to see her in a more becoming dark hairstyle (if it wasn't a wig) than the one she had to wear in \"Double Indemnity\" the year before. That film, while the premiere \"film noir\" and an all-around great film, gave her a great role, but oh, that hair. Here, she is more chic and certainly no femme fatal, but she is certainly a 40's woman. She has gotten used to life without men since most of them are off at war, and as a successful Martha Stewart like columnist, she writes a homey column in which she describes her country home as the camera pans over what it really is. We meet her boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea that she is living a lie, and when he pushes his way in for a Christmas away at her supposed Connecticut home, she has to come up with a husband (Reginald Gardiner) and baby before we can say \"Jingle Bells\". Hungarian chef S.Z. Sakall steps in to help and ends up in a cutsey pie one-on-one with Irish Una O'Connor. \"It's not Goulash, It's Irish Stew\". Sakall simply takes the paprika, pours most of it in, and says, \"Now it's goulash\", totally changing what she has prepared for lunch. Then, when it comes to the flapjacks, he flips and she scoops. For years, a few friends of mine and I will use that line every time pancakes come up in a conversation. \"I don't flip. I scoop!\". She won't even flip just one for Greenstreet, saying \"I've never flipped in me life.\" O'Connor can get on the nerves when she screeches over and over in some films, but here, she is delightfully lovable, and her pairing with Sakall is very charming. It is obvious in the romance department that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwyck's cup of tea, especially when she meets handsome Dennis Morgan, who is a bit dimwitted when bathing the baby, which eats soap, causing Stanwyck to get a bit alarmed. He should suspect something instantly, but doesn't. But it doesn't matter. The film is so charming with the country setting filled with snow, an abundance of rocking chairs, and a dog running towards them as the sleigh comes up. Living in New York City after 25 years in Los Angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of New York State made me miss this kind of Christmas. While Central Park is beautiful after a first snow and the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is exsquisit too, there is something about looking out at a snow-covered field of trees, and catch an occasional glimpse of deer, rabbits, or other wild life. This is a great holiday film that can also bring on the Christmas spirit out of season, and makes a great pairing with another Barbara Stanwyck country Christmas film, \"Remember the Night\", an underrated gem. Add on the big city Christmas of \"Meet John Doe\", and you've found perhaps one of the busiest stars of holiday films around. A Christmas Classic; \"Christmas In Connecticut\" is a gem of a Christmas movie classic. While lesser known than some others -- it is nonetheless a delightful way to spend an evening at holiday time. I watch it every year. Barbara Stanwyck is perfectly cast as, Elizabeth Lane, the single, career girl. Way before it was popular, Stanwyck embodies the single girl on the rise. Her NYC apartment, and her friendly \"uncle\" restaurateur around the corner typify the single girl in the city existence. She can't cook yet she writes a homemaking column for a magazine! Dennis Morgan is also perfectly cast as our wartime hero, Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet the amazing Elizabeth Lane. After being lost at sea, all he wants is to spend Christmas in a \"real\" home. Which sets up the delightful, madcap story that evolves. It is fun from beginning to end. We should all have an Uncle Felix too! Christmas Classic; Barbara Stanwyck is a magazine writer of articles on being the perfect homemaker. She's the Martha Stewart of her day. Unfortunately, she's also a huge fraud. She can't cook and doesn't even have the family she writes about! When she's put in the position of having to make a big Christmas dinner for her publisher (the always excellent Sydney Greenstreet) and a war veteran (Dennis Morgan), she scrambles to keep up the ruse of her \"happy homemaker\" image. Funny Christmas romantic comedy helped by a superb cast. Stanwyck and Greenstreet are terrific, as usual. Dennis Morgan is very good as the poor soldier who hasn't been allowed to eat solid foods and is salivating at the thought of a big Christmas dinner. A great supporting cast including S.Z. Sakall, Robert Shayne, Una O'Connor, Reginald Gardiner, and the adorable Joyce Compton. This is definitely a must-see Christmas classic for everybody. Great Romantic Comedy; This is a wonderful romantic comedy. Barbara Stanwyck's timing is right on. All the characters are top notch. The architect gets a little predictable but plays his srole well. Dennis Morgan has an incredible voice and we get to hear him twice.I just love Uncle Felix! A movie for all seasons; Though it's a Christmas movie, \"Christmas in Connecticut\" could have been done any time of year, as it's the story of a soldier who spends what is to be an idyllic time with a Martha Stewart type. That's what he thinks. In reality, the lady in question, portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck, has a popular magazine column about life on a farm with her husband and baby. She has no farm, no husband, and no baby, nor are the many recipes she publishes hers. They belong to the restaurant owner nearby. When her no-nonsense editor, Sydney Greenstreet, insists that she entertain soldier Dennis Morgan, she enlists the aid of her boyfriend to use his farm, and she transports herself and the restaurateur there. There's even a baby...well, actually, there's more than one. Chaos ensues, and the charade becomes increasingly difficult to play out, especially when Stanwyck falls in love with Morgan. This is such a wonderful movie, and even if you're gravely depressed, \"Christmas in Connecticut\" can lift you right out of it. Barbara Stanwyck is wonderful as the career woman turned homemaker. Despite not being as flashy as Crawford or Davis, she was nevertheless able to do what any role called for - she could be cheap, elegant, warm, nasty, cold, and/or sexy and she makes it look easy. On top of that, she is always attractive and alluring. Dennis Morgan is a handsome and charming solider; as an added bonus, he gets to use his Irish tenor. Fiancé Reginald Gardner is all business, and you can tell he's not quite right for Stanwyck. S.Z. Sakall as the fake uncle/real chef is hilarious, especially as he prays Stanwyck can flip a pancake before an audience. I can imagine the impact this delightful film had at the tail end of World War II. It must have been a real beacon for the better times to come. Ultimate Christmas movie; I first saw this film about 15 years ago, and I have been enchanted by it ever since. It is such a feel-good experience, that I could happily watch it at any time of the year. However, to me, it is the ultimate Christmas movie. The fact that it is in B&amp;W is irrelevant - although I often wonder what it would be like in colour. You can just get that warm, glowing feeling watching the Christmas events unfold. Stanwyck and Morgan are perfect together, and Greenstreet is the antithesis of his usual character, Sakall is a blustering joy to watch. It is light relief and certainly does not tax the brain, but leaves you feeling glad that you saw it. I can't wait for it to become available on DVD in the UK. I shall certainly be at the front of the queue to buy it. hunky-dunky; I just got this movie for Christmas and have already added it to my favorites list.  A cute and simple story which makes a beautiful movie. Who could not love Uncle Felix or not have their mouth water at the sound of all that food.  Definite points go to Sydney Greenstreet for his performance of Alexander Yardley and also to Reginald Gardiner who played John Sloane, the impossibly boring fiancee. Truly a gem to be watched every Christmas. Christmas Con Job; I've always liked Barbara Stanwyck who was, perhaps, the hardest working lead actress of the 30's and 40's although few of her movie roles are memorable. Today she is remembered most for the TV show \"The Big Valley\". Stanwyck worked so much because she was durable; it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence. And so it was for \"Christmas in Connecticut\" a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isn't even really about Christmas. It does, however, have Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan as well as some supreme character actors including Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. Sakall so there are plot twists and funny moments which undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than they do today. To begin, the plot concerns a magazine writer (Stanwyck) who the magazine's readers believe is a domestic goddess, married with a child and living on a farm in Connecticut but who is really single, lives in New York City and knows nothing about cooking or homemaking. Could anyone get away with such a fraud even then? Apparently, and even the owner of the magazine (Greenstreet) is deceived although one would think that he would have long since seen though the deception but the story moves on and Stanwyck, Greenstreet, a sailor recently survived from his sunken ship (Morgan) and Stanwyck's restaurateur friend (S.Z.Sakall) find themselves spending Christmas in Connecticut at a farm belonging to Stanwyck's boorish boyfriend (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine all the possibilities there are for this as the fraud unwinds as it must. Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the rouse but one wonders how she can stand him at all. Morgan and Stanwyck fall for each other but he is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married. Regardless, they begin what seems to be a make believe affair dancing cheek to cheek and stealing off in a horse drawn sleigh. Meanwhile, the incredibly naive Greenstreet character who has seen Stanwyck and Morgan go off together but still doesn't get it sees one of the neighbors take back a child that has been borrowed as part of the deception and calls the cops to report a kidnapping. Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the sleigh and the hoax begins to unwind. At this point the movie is funny as in ridiculous or absurd, not funny ha,ha and it routinely ends like screwball comedies always did. The good guy gets the girl and presumably they live happily ever after. I watch this movie every year at Christmas to enjoy these character actors at their best in a story that reflects way it was in 1945 and because of a long held fascination with Barbara Stanwyck. Thank goodness it was set at Christmas or like 95 percent of Stanwyck's movies it would have been long ago forgotten and we would not get to see it each year anew. Who \"Elizabeth Lane\" was REALLY  based on.; At the time that this movie was made most housewives knew exactly who Barbara Stanwick was parodying.Today only some women over 50 probably remember Gladys Taber,whose column \"Butternut Wisdom\" ran in Family Circle Magazine from before World War II until the 1970's.She lived on Stillmeadow Farm in Conecticut,and her columns were collected into a number of books,Stillmeadow Seasons, Stillmeadow Daybook, etc. The lines that Barbara Stanwick recites as she types them for her column are quite typical of the ones that began a typical Gladys Taber column.Besides cooking and country living,she got rather nostalgic and philosophical at times.She talked a lot about her favorite dogs, mostly cocker spaniels.You might say that Martha Stewart is the Gladys Tabor of today. Christmas is Connecticut may not be any cinematic masterpiece,but it is pleasant,lighthearted entertainment,soothing to the stressed out mind,and that is good enough Martha Stewart is a Fraud; No need to wait until Christmas to watch this laugh a minute film. In this film a War Hero is invited to a life style magazine writer who is a Martha Stewart before there was a Martha Stewart. She makes all her meals look like fine dinning. Her articles talk about her private life which includes her marriage and her child. The problem is that she is lying. She is not married and can't cook. When her boss demands that she take in the war hero she is up the creek. Other problems include that she doesn't have a child. It is a very funny film that you should see! This is the film that many situation comedy show have stolen from. Not Enough To Be A Christmas Classic; \"What a Christmas\" is the closing line of this movie, coming from the lips of Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) - a magazine publisher who's just experienced what probably would indeed have been his most confusing Christmas ever. Unfortunately, the last line just didn't quite capture my feelings about the movie. It's not that this is a bad movie. Quite the contrary - it's a very pleasant seasonal film, but that may be its biggest problem. It's up against some pretty stiff competition in terms of Christmas films, and there was nothing in particular about this that would make me want to watch it again and again. We have certain holiday traditions in our home, some of which do revolve around watching certain movies. \"A Christmas Carol,\" \"Miracle On 34th Street,\" \"It's A Wonderful Life.\" They're all annual events. Even a more recent piece of comedy such as \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" shows up in our house every year. \"Christmas In Connecticut\" was fun to watch once, but I can't see doing it every year. The story had the potential to be funnier than it turned out to be. Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) is a magazine columnist, who offers cooking and homemaking tips from the perspective of her life as a wife and mother on a Connecticut farm. The problem is that she has no kids, she isn't married and she lives in an apartment in the city. Everything about her column is a lie, but her boss Yardley doesn't know that, and he arranges to have a sailor who spent 18 days in a life raft after his boat was shot out from under him (Jeff Jones, played by Dennis Morgan) spend Christmas with Lane and her \"family\" so that he can experience a real family Christmas. How to pull this off without Yardley figuring out the truth becomes the plot. It's mildly funny, and Stanwyck and Morgan had a great chemistry. I also enjoyed the performances from S.Z. Sakall as Felix and Una O'Connor as Nora, and spent at least part of the movie wondering if those two would hook up. There's nothing really wrong with this, except possibly to note that at the very beginning of the film Jones and his buddy look awfully healthy for two guys who had been stuck in a life raft all that time! As I said, it just doesn't match up well to the classic Christmas competition. Delightful; This is a delightful, they-don't-make-em-like-this-anymore kind of film. Well performed by everyone and peopled with interesting character actors. An intelligent, witty script acted with the right blend of broad comedy and understated humor. Holds up for repeated (annual?) viewings. **WARNING** the re-make of this film with the same name, directed by Arnold Whatwashethinking, is an unbearable mess - painful to watch - without a scintilla of the charm and wit of the original. A  change of pace world war two screwball comedy; The first half of the 1940's was marked by well known performers from other film genres stepping out of character to star in what may be the last wave of remembered Hollywood screwball comedies still marketed for home viewing and seasonally aired on television. Barbara Stanwyck does her usual professional job as the hard as nails career woman fudging a domestic column for a magazine whose bluff is called in thirties type screwball involving a runaway horse and cow, mixed up babies, Cuddles Szakall stealing the show at every turn with his comic flair and a rural farmhouse which lacks the central iconic focus of every movie advertising the charm of a rural farmhouse - the welcoming, party sized period kitchen. The storyboard is a nonsensical enough fantasy to work yet the editing takes most of the true comic flair out of the film. It seems to me most of the way through a decent musical with at least Dennis Morgan singing once but not truly a top flight comedy. Heartwarming comedy delightful change of pace for Stanwyck; Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy, about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a popular magazine writer's family, at her farm in Connecticut. The problem is she has no husband, baby, or farm, as she writes about in her column, and she can't even cook; her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend \" Uncle\" Felix, owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York City. Things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for Christmas. A scheme is hastily planned, with her stuffy fiancé providing an actual Connecticut farm, neighbors providing a borrowed baby, and a quick wedding planned when the publisher isn't looking. But when the handsome young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve, romantic complications ensue, as the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks for the nice guy Navy man and vice versa. This is a charming, warm film that deftly balances humor with sentiment and is a wonderful showcase for Barbara Stanwyck to display her considerable comedic talent, aided by such marvelous character actors as Sydney Greenstreet, Una O'Connor, S.Z.Sakall, and many others. A Christmas night dance at the town hall is a toe tapping delight to see, and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of Stanwyck is a wonderful surprise, for viewers who have seen her mainly as tough, bitchy women in femme fatale roles. Truly a wonderful film that has stood the test of time. The Ultimate Tangled Web; This is a great movie if you don't mind the discomfort of watching people perpetuate a cover-up. Barbara Stanwyk plays a food editor for a magazine. She has gained a national reputation but in reality has no skills at all. She has been given her information and her recipes from a man she works for. Everything comes to a boil when she is asked to host a man who is a war hero and who is on a special diet at her home in Connecticut. Of course, they have to stage things in order for her not to lose her career and what ensues is one close call after another with people coming and going, trying to cover up for her. This is one of those really fun movies that defies reality but that doesn't matter. Not A Great Christmas Film But Quite Watchable Due To The Assembled Cast; There's some things I certainly love about Christmas In Connecticut, but Barbara Stanwyck really isn't at the top of the list. I've always found Ms. Stanwyck to be a bit too cold to be sweet, a bit too melodramatic to be truly vulnerable to the point of one burning to save her, and polarizing in her beauty which, to me at any rate, was different from either a classic beauty or the girl next door. But, Ms. Stanwyck was without doubt a good actress that could make you watch even if you didn't particularly think she was the lead you wished for. I guess that puts her in a kind of \"rare-air\" actress league? Anyway, this is a simple story with good parts played by an all-round decent cast. It's suppose to be a romantic comedy, but it is light on both the romance and the comedy. Neither gets particularly showcased, but it isn't for lack of trying. A war hero spends weeks on a raft and is celebrated upon coming home. A single-minded magazine business magnate sees an opportunity. His star columnist is a kind of Martha Stewart of the day. Only thing Elizabeth Lane, the columnist, isn't a homemaker, she's just a fine writer of \"fiction\" you might say as she weaves her life to be the consummate cook, homemaker, and mother, none of which is true. It sells a lot of magazines however. This sets up our main story which is the magazine owner insists Mrs. Lane entertains the war hero, Jefferson James played by Dennis Morgan, over a long Holiday weekend. Mr. James will be treated to life with the nation's top homemaker for festive eats, entertainment, and a taste of the American Dream he's fighting for. Well, it's a major predicament and to pull it off Ms. Lane will go to some lengths which include borrowing several infants of different sex, hair color, and size to stand in for her one child. The Christmas element here is kind of incidental in providing a vehicle and it really isn't a movie that celebrates the season too awfully much. I like old movies from this era and as much as anything this is why I like Christmas In Connecticut. The other reason is the always fun to watch Sydney Greenstreet and S.Z Sakall who steal most every scene they appear in. I'm surprised this movie is rated as high as 7.5 (circa late 2016), I feel it's more modest and only as good as a 6.5 because of not the story, but the cast. Not a must see of the Christmas Season, but a nice one for fans of 40's comedies. Charming and Sophisticated; Add this little gem to your list of holiday regulars.  It is sweet, funny, and endearing</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                 a somewhat cheaper copy of Antonioni's 'Blow Up'; Although not bad, 'Col guore in gola' is clearly inspired by Michelangelo Antonioni's 'Blow Up' -- the famous film from 1966, capturing London's young & fashionable mid-Sixties spirit with unparalleled quality. This Italian copy even goes as far as mentioning Antonioni. 'Col guore in gola's somewhat hazy plot clearly does not make this film's main attraction. It's the visuals that are prominent here, and they surely are great and inspiring. And very, yes very, mid-Sixties -- as well as a little too extended to our 21st century-taste. Male lead Jean Louis Trintignant does not need any introduction. His performance is as usual: most competent. Female lead Ewa Aulin, reminding me of Goldie Hawn, does well, too. Together they take you through 'Col guore in gola', making you a nice watch. Jean-Louis Trintignant falls for Ewa Aulin and hunts for a murderer; \"I Am What I Am\" is a line that Ewa Aulin delivers in this film, and it's a meaningful title in the context of the story. \"Deadly Sweet\" is another title this goes under, and that too is meaningful. Ewa Aulin is not going to change for Trintignant, and she is as deadly as she is sweet. The story intertwines a murder mystery and a love story. In a nightclub, Trintignant is attracted to Ewa Aulin whose father has been killed by an automobile. He watches her from a distance. Later he finds the club owner killed and Ewa is present but denies having killed him. The owner had something on her father. Trintignant and she flee the scene and begin a search for information and a photograph. They have a torrid affair and he's thoroughly hooked on her. Certain of her lies crop up and trouble him, but she seductively patches the matters over. A second murder occurs, which is of the man who supposedly has the photo. Again, the two of them find the body. Trintignant alone finds and pockets an ear ring near the corpse. Both avoid the cops, who play no role of any substance in the story. They are pursued, however, by hoods at times. Ewa's brother also comes into the story as a complicating factor and suspect. The hoods at one point kidnap Ewa. Trintignant and the brother have to deal with that. This film digresses at times or takes liberties with the viewers. It does this in several sequences. One shows the flirtation of Trintignant and Aulin in a park. There are several others that show the sixties kind of culture, war newsreels, nightclub dancing, etc. These sequences shift the focus of the film away from being a straight-out psychologically-influenced mystery, but they also show the milieu or psychedelic scene in which Trintignant would fall for a 17-year old girl and how he would expect her to behave as being from that generation. Trintignant's movies are typically worthwhile. I try to see every one I can. He has a remarkable capacity to underplay his roles and yet become the character he is portraying. Deadly Sweet....; Just saw this tonight uncut on the big screen here in Hollywood. Visually very nice. But not really a giallo, I don't know why people keep calling it that. There is a murder which basically occurs off-screen and has almost nothing to do with the \"story.\" Virtually no violence, some eyebrow-raising sex, obviously inspired by Antonioni, et al. Little story, lots of avant garde/graphic style, references to Pop-Art/Lichtenstein, comics, \"Blow-Up\" and other movies/the Viet Nam War/other issues of the day. Nice visuals/editing/soundtrack (which was remarkably clear in the print I just saw, supposedly soon to be out on DVD). At times notably innovative and fresh. A bit of a surprise ending. Wandering narrative, quick cuts, lots of color and gritty flair. Swinging London backdrop. In b/w and color. Not a great film, but worth seeing; This pop psychedelic giallo is an early film by the Italian \"master of eroticism\" (he's definitely \"master\" of something), Tinto Brass. Unfortunately, it's VERY derivative of Michaelangelo Antonioni's \"Blow-up\" from the previous year, and while some find that movie borderline pretentious, this movie is well over the borderline. It also compares pretty unfavorably to the OTHER pop psychedelic giallo released in 1967, \"Death Laid an Egg\", which also features French actor Jean Trintigant and Swedish nymphet Ewe Aulin. But just because it isn't as good as two excellent movies like \"Blow-up\" and \"Death Laid an Egg\" doesn't necessarily make it bad. It's well filmed, and it has good acting and good music. I actually liked it better than \"Salon Kitty\", \"Caligula\" or any of Brass' other later, more erotic, but much more tedious ventures. The story is pretty insubstantial. A man spots a a young girl at a disco and is immediately drawn to her. Later he finds the disco owner dead and the young woman standing over his body. Since the disco owner was apparently blackmailing her recently deceased father, the girl suspects that the killer might be a member of her own oddball family--her androgynous twin brother, her grasping mother, or her sinister gangster stepfather. As the couple are chased all over Swinging late 60's London by all kinds of colorful characters, including a hulking black man and a dwarf, they try to piece together the bizarro plot (while the viewers try even less successfully to do the same thing). Brass also throws in a lot of black and white footage--perhaps in an homage to American film noir--however, this style really clashes with the colorful psychedelic pop art and the principal story, which far from being downbeat and noirish, is often as light and airy as a soufflé. Trintigant was one of the most famous French actors of the period. He was kind of in the same mold as Jean-Paul Belomondo, Jean Sorel, and Alain Delon. But he didn't seem to rely as much on his good looks as some of his fellow French leading men, and he was often in more interesting, offbeat films like Robbe-Grillet's \"TransEuropean Express\", \"The Angry Sheep\", and, of course, \"Death Laid an Egg\". Ewe Aulin, who was only seventeen at the time, did this film as part of a 1967 trifecta which also included \"Death Laid an Egg\" and the big-budget celebrity-train-wreck sex comedy \"Candy\". Only one of these was really a good movie, but SHE is definitely very memorable in all three of them. If nothing else, this is certainly a prime example of a European co-production of the era--an Italian film shot in London with a French leading man and a Swedish leading lady. This is by no means a great film, but it is worth seeing. \"The Sixties - What a shrill, pointless decade\"; Tinto Brass is one of the more critically applauded Italian directors, what with the films Salon Kitty and the one called Caligula that had Malcolm McDowell as Caligula bumming some unwilling guy. That's how I felt watching this uneasy mash-up of Giallo and sixties groovy crapfest. This was truly a struggle from start to finish. French Guy gets involved with Jane, a groovy chick whom he finds in a room with a dead nightclub owner. French Guy thinks she didn't do nothing, and the two embark on a journey to find out who really killed the nightclub owner. Sadly for them and us a relentless barrage of sixties references assault them and the viewer until you don't care what happens, as long as the film ends some time soon. Jane has a brother who has gone missing and there's a load of bad guys following the two around everywhere trying to kill French Guy and kidnap Jane, including a dwarf who gives French guy a kicking. Jane gets herself kidnapped and French Guy hooks up with her brother to rescue her. Other stuff happens but you'll have killed yourself long before then. The problem with this film is that it's crap. Brass has the bones of a giallo film but for some reason feels the need to constantly refer to the 'swinging' sixties, with constant references to pop art, the Beatles, freak-outs, all that stuff. It's like a film being made these days with constant references to fidget spinners, fake news, and people voluntarily micro-chipping themselves so that they can programme their heating from their hands (what's wrong with those morons?) A lot of the time I was suffering from a very large Jess Franco vibe from this film, and by that I mean there was a lot of messing around on nothing that seriously disrupted the flow of the film and making me not care at all about anything that happened at all. Average Giallo from a T&A man.; When I see Tinto Brass, I think of Cheeky and Salon Kitty. T&A features, not traditional giallo. I am willing to be surprised. You are going to be reminded by a current jail occupant in Orlando, Fl, who was dancing the night away after her daughter went missing. The children. Jane (Ewa Aulin) and Jerome (Charles Kohler) Burroughs, in this film are in a nightclub right after they visit their father in the morgue. Guess death can't interfere with life. Bernard (Jean-Louis Trintignant) discovers her with his dead partner and takes her away. They go looking for the killer. It's not as bloody as most giallo, and there is no nudity to speak of, but it is worth watching. It had an almost comic book air at times, and the music was definitely upbeat. The cinematography was outstanding on this print and really made it worthwhile. Inexpensive and dated mystery.; Well, Eva Aulin is certainly delicious and Jean-Louis Trintignant is sympatico as is usually the case, but the film in its entirety suffers from a poor script and from the director's misguided whimsy. Trintignant visits his partner's office, up the stairs from a dance hall, and discovers Aulin standing over the body, holding a gun, saying she didn't do it. Trintignant takes a second look at seventeen-year-old, blond, robustly figured, ex-Swedish-beauty-contest-winner Eva Aulin and quickly decides, \"Right, she couldn't have done it.\" He runs off with her to search out the REAL killers, and we are treated to a tour of swinging London's most-visited sights. Here's Picadilly Circus. See all the skin shops? And, look -- here's a poster of The Beatles! There's also a kind of zoo. There are small shots of one of Trintignant's eyes. It gets confusing. I think they copulate on top of Nelson's Column but I'm not sure. I AM sure they copulate in Trintignant's apartment in a scene that is all apricot and rose and consists of unidentified hands caressing unidentified body parts. I guess Brass forgot to include the softly billowing crimson drapes and the lighted candles. When somebody hits someone else over the head, there are Pop inserts of the sounds, as in the old Batman TV series -- POW! and ZLONK! I've only seen three or four of Tinto Brass's movie but I'm already able to discern a kind of stylistic arc through the murk. In this film, the earliest of his that I've seen, he appears to be doing everything possible to draw attention to himself as the director. (The screen splits into three separate scenes at one point.) And the relentless use of pop imagery is symptomatic. Hey, look! Mamma mia, I'm inna movies! In a somewhat later film, I think called \"L'Uolo,\" about a handful of people in a surrealistic hotel, the narrative is thrown out completely and we get one bizarre image after another -- no longer just pop, but a kaleidoscopic non sequitur that carries no weight at all after the first few shocking minutes. Finally, Brass found his metier, in the no-man's land between soft-core and hard-core porn. The stories in this later genre aren't original. Usually a bourgeois wife is bored with her marriage and finds a lover who introduces her to, well, a different kind of love. It wasn't original with \"Emanuelle\" either, or \"Lady Chatterly's Lover,\" for that matter. I'd guess that the theme was first introduced to a public audience somewhere back in time, past Aristophanes, into the Masques, into the mists of antiquity. Of the three phases of Tinto Brass's career, I prefer the last one, the one with the preposterous, prodigious, prosthetic penises. At least there, the director seems to have found a comfortable and satisfying niche. The Italian title, \"Col Cuore in Gola,\" means \"With Heart in Throat,\" but the English title is as much a puzzle as the movie itself. \"I Am What I Am.\" Is it from Yahweh or Popeye? I've been told this is a \"cult movie.\" I wonder what a cult movie is. nice giallo;  A rather unusual agenda from tinto brass who obviously found later his niche in \"t&a\" movies. Col cuore in Gola is a psychedelic, pop art giallo that can just come from the great era of the late 60´s/70´s. Starting from the nice credits and music you immediately like this film and this is just the beginning! Trintignant founds in a nightclub a corpse beside the lovely aulin who just says \"i wasnt it\" Convinced that she is innocent he wants to help her and want to find out the murderer, Aulins brother should solve this case and both are searching for him. Though not quite without problems..a dwarf in raincoat is following them in companion with some gangsters who kidnap Aulin. Jean is now searching for aulin, aulins brother and (of course) the murderer. The Story itself is not that convincing (rather unimportant) but what here is really of interest is the unconvential style of brass : splitscreen(even tripple split screens!) some scenes in black and dark yellow filter and more.., and in the \"middle\" of course the presence of two very convincing leads: cool Trintignant and hot Ewa Aulin. (somehow priceless here in white fishnet stockings) the result is a quite good giallo with (obviously) strong references to pop art. In the same year Aulin and Trintignant appeared in the avantgarde giallo masterpiece \"Death laid an egg\", Col Cuore in Gola is not great as Giulio Questis film but is definitely entertaining. AKA ... Deadly Sweet; This film is very stylized, liked a lot of the editing effects, the split images in-particular, also how it cuts to war images of Vietnam and changes to black and white in parts. The sets, costumes/wardrobe are elaborate and detailed, the lighting is very good also. Interesting to see London in the 60's, notice how the trains are still powered by steam in the scene behind the graveyard. The casting is quite strong especially Jean-Louis Trintignant who plays the lead role, he is supported by the beautiful Ewa Aulin, the cast of nefarious mob type figures is also a standout. The storyline although a little weak leaves you guessing until the end. It is quite enjoyable overall, but seems a little experimental and doesn't really mesh, but I liked the fact it had a sad ending.   \n",
       "14973  Pleasing holiday comedy thanks to splendid cast...; Anyone who has watched the recent remake of 'Christmas in Connecticut' will fully appreciate just how wonderful the slim story was in the hands of Barbara Stanwyck, Dennis Morgan and Sydney Greenstreet. No masterpiece, but so much better than the weak remake. The whole film revolves around the mistaken belief by editor Greenstreet that Stanwyck (his favorite Martha Stewart-type of writer) is a homemaker with a house, husband and baby in the country. This, of course, means that the inventive woman has to enlist the aid of others to play out her scheme when Greenstreet invites himself and a ship-wrecked sailor (Dennis Morgan) for the holiday week-end. The slight comedy develops a few complications along the way--and it all looks very holidayish with the lovely country home in Connecticut--which, thanks to Warner Bros. art decoration, looks like something from a magazine cover. Stanwyck's forte is really heavy drama but here she displays a light enough touch to make her scenes with Morgan and Greenstreet delightful to watch. She gets great support from Una O'Connor, S.Z. Sakall and Reginald Gardiner under Peter Godfrey's light-hearted direction. It's as unpretentious a confection as a child's homemade Christmas card and just as charming--light and fluffy entertainment that makes no great demands on your viewing pleasure. Worth viewing, especially around the holidays. A movie of missed opportunities!; At 102 minutes, this Barbara Stanwyck/Dennis Morgan entry is allowed to run too long. After all, it is  as every customer will instantly recognize  one of those movies that give away their entire plot line in the cast credit titles. It's obvious that the beautifully photographed Barbara Stanwyck is going to fall for and marry serviceman Dennis Morgan. Anything Barbara has to say to anybody else in the cast is just wasting time  unless she says something particularly witty or humorous. She doesn't! If I was writing this screenplay, I would be sure to add plenty of humor to Barbara's dialogue. I'd make sure that she was always bitingly sarcastic, particularly in her exchanges with Sydney Greenstreet. But in fact, she doesn't assert herself at all. Why the hell not? Instead, she treats him with kid gloves and sucks up to the self-opinionated moron. Why? I'll admit the writer was aware of this problem, so he or she or they paint the Stanwyck character as a liar. And an opportunistic liar at that! One of those liars who will tell you anything either to get out of a scrape or to advance their own career! I'll admit Barbara does her damnedest to soft peddle this aspect, but it's there all the same! In fact, soft peddling is the wrong approach. You make her someone who glories in her lies, not someone who's ashamed of them. That's ridiculous! There's an excellent performance here by Greenstreet as the mogul you love to hate and whom you'd just adore to see getting his comeuppance from a fiery Barbara  but it doesn't happen! I could go on and on, but let's just agree that C. in C. is easy to sit through once, but it's a movie of hundreds of missed opportunities. That's an exaggeration. Let's say, dozens of missed opportunities. Available on an excellent Warner Brothers DVD. Not One Of My Favorites; This movie has inexplicably become a Christmastime favorite but I don't get it. Full of preposterous turns of events, poor acting likely due to direction since it involves such otherwise great actors, boring scenes, an overly long story line that never seems to end and the miscasting of Barbara Stanwyck as a romantic lead (sorry, I don't see her in that role and in fact this movie shoots her face in ways that makes her look the least attractive I've ever seen her in a movie), this movie disappoints. (Stanwyck has ugly looks on her face, in fact, in the sleigh ride scene and I wonder why these were not re- shot.) The one saving grace in this movie is S.Z. Sakall; this movie showed off his talents well. But others did not fare so well, in my humble opinion. For example - Sydney Greenstreet's final lines (delivered with an unnecessarily extreme camera close-up) were not delivered well nor was his facial expression flattering. I would have re-shot those moments or - better yet - given the film a better ending. It was kind of lame. The love story, in the final analysis, in all its twists and turns, does not ring true. Not believable. I must be wrong though - since Robert Osborne, the noted film historian, thinks this is a great film. My bad. But, personally speaking, this is one movie I could not stand to see ever again. I found it excruciatingly dull and improbable. When the Christmas tree is up watch this film with your family; A lighthearted, joyful comedy that gives the new, superbly comedic, meaning to a traditional Christmas party. Very amusing and hearty, Christmas in Connecticut presents a wonderfully cheerful love story with many slapstick elements. When a war hero Jefferson Jones comes back home and wants to spend the Holidays in a nice, homely atmosphere, fate sends him to the doorstep of a well-known food critic Elisabeth Lane. Unfortunately for her, she has lied for a long time to her readers about having a loving family and a house in the countryside.And now is the time for a perfect set-up. With the help of a few friends she arranges a drastically improvised make-believe ceremony. As one can imagine, from the beginning nothing seems to go as planned and after a few laughable moments everything goes amusingly berserk. Love takes over, and Elisabeth - despite having a still unwed, fake husband - falls in love with her handsome guest. The whole mystification goes out of control and the Christmas in ruined for the amusement of some, and for the disgust of others. With an enchanting feel and many hilarious sequences, Christmas in Connecticut is a screwball comedy that will definitely appeal to most viewers, more so during the annual family gatherings. Lightweight But Pleasant Holiday Feature; This lightweight but pleasant holiday feature makes the most out of a pretty slim premise, thanks to a solid cast and some resourceful writing. Not meant to be taken very seriously, it provides easygoing entertainment with some simple but upbeat themes. Barbara Stanwyck was an interesting choice as the lead, and she makes it work well enough. The premise of Stanwyck's writer character trying to fool everyone and maintain her image is more suited to screwball comedy than to a holiday feature, but the tone is kept light and funny while having just enough of the holiday atmosphere to be believable. The supporting cast helps out, with the likes of \"Cuddles\" Sakall and Sydney Greenstreet getting some good moments. This kind of light but worthwhile feature is not as easy as it looks - as witness the string of crass, barely watchable holiday features of recent years. While hardly anything deep or brilliant, \"Christmas in Connecticut\" holds up well enough to be among the more enjoyable movies of its kind. Excellent Christmas-flavoured screwball/romantic comedy that has two of my favourite actors!; I greatly loved this yuletide film, with excellent performances by Barbara Stanwyck and Sydney Greenstreet, and fine direction by Peter Godfrey. Had they a stronger actor in the lead than Dennis Morgan, it would be a perfect film, but it's still a wonderful Christmas perennial and favourite to watch. The Oscar-winning short Star in the Night, directed by Don Siegel and a bonus on this DVD, is even better...Very charming film is more a straight romantic comedy than a Christmas film per se, but any chance to see cinematic greats such as Barbara Stanwyck (especially at this vintage) and, one of the finest character actors ever in Sydney Greenstreet, together is definitely not a lump of coal in a cinephile's Christmas stocking, no-siree! Classic Holiday Movie!; Christmas in Connecticut (1945 - Directed by Peter Godfrey) Barbara Stanwyck stars as a well-known magazine food writer who has been lying to her millions of fans that she is married with child and lives the traditional wife/mother role in a lovely country farm house. Magazine editor Sydney Greenstreet decides that Stanwyck should host returning war veteran Dennis Morgan at her country house over the Christmas holidays! Yikes! What's Stanwyck to do? Why marry her long time suitor, architect John Sloan, (who just happens to have the perfect country house in Connecticut) in a hurry and high tail it out to Connecticut faster than you can say \"I do\" before the boss finds out and she loses her job and becomes the laughing stock of the country. This is a charming and lightly played holiday tale that allows Stanwyck to turn in one of her best comedic roles.  The movie has all the ingredients for a holiday classic: a farm in the country, lots of snow, mishaps and miscommunications to keep everyone guessing as to how the whole thing will turn out in the end. Of course, Stanwyck never does marry her architect friend and instead falls head over heels with the war hero. It's one of the lesser known holiday movies, but year by year, is getting more and more attention.  If you don't go for the heavily sweet holiday fare, this is just what the doctor ordered. Charming & delightful holiday classic; This is a wonderful old fashioned Christmas favorite, which I try to catch on TV every year if I can. It revolves around a Martha Stewart like journalist named Elizabeth Lane, charmingly portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck. However, in contrast to Martha, this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever. The other cast members effectively complete the story, and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley). Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food articles, portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children. In reality, she is a single woman living in a New York City apartment and cannot boil an egg. Her recipes are borrowed from her Hungarian chef friend, Felix. Elizabeth gets away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine, Alexander Yardley, decides he wants a nice old fashioned country Christmas, and invites himself to visit her, bringing with him a returning war hero, Jefferson Jones, a sailor who had been shipwrecked. Yardley demands total honesty of his employees. To get out of her predicament and save her deception based career, Elizabeth borrows the Connecticut country home of her longtime architect suitor, John Sloan, a dull, fussy chap who has long sought marriage. She also borrows a neighbour's baby (actually, several) to pass off as her own and her 'husband' Sloan's. Of course this scenario makes for much merriment. It's a screwball comedy and a charming romance, with the added attraction of a Christmas atmosphere. Whenever I think of this movie, I picture the snowflakes falling, the tree beautifully decorated, the fire roaring in the hearth, the turkey roasting, and Christmas cookies baking. Why did Hollywood feel compelled to do a remake? I understand there is a 1992 version, directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and starring Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson, and Tony Curtis. I have not seen this modern adaptation nor do I wish to. This old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday 'must see' along with It's a Wonderful Life, White Christmas, Miracle on 34th Street, and of course all the versions of A Christmas Carol. Not so hunky dunky; Barbara Stanwyck (Mrs Lane) is a popular journalist on Sydney Greenstreet's (Yardley) magazine who specializes in homely life articles from her farm in Connecticut with her husband and baby. She also tops the charts when it comes to her recipes. War hero Dennis Morgan (Jeff) wins an opportunity to spend Christmas at her farm courtesy of Greenstreet who also invites himself along. How nice. Except Stanwyck is a fraud. She can't cook, she doesn't live on a farm, she doesn't live in Connecticut, she hasn't got a baby and she hasn't got a husband. And she doesn't want to get busted so she needs help to keep up the pretence This has a good premise for comedic situations and Stanwyck is funny in her role, especially when it comes to her baby etiquette. However, there are too many misunderstandings that need resolving and so we regretfully fall into a madcap zany, screwball comedy that gets tedious. By the end of the film you have been willing things to resolve themselves for at least 20 minutes and it has also become complicated. They didn't need so many things going wrong and opportunities for better comedic situations weren't explored as much as they could have been, for example, the arrival of a different baby. That could have been very funny. But, the film became poorly written. Characters also started to grate, especially Uncle SZ Sakall (Felix). He has that cuddly image but he is just annoying. There are funny moments, more so at the beginning as you set out with the film, but I'm afraid the film gets boring. I read one reviewer who said that this film reminded him of \"Holiday Inn\" (1942) only this was funnier. What!!?? He is obviously completely bonkers. Watch \"Holiday Inn\" every time over \"Christmas In Connecticut\". Barbara Stanwyck gets in a flap when asked to find a farm, find a family and flip flapjacks.; A classic farce set against a classically Christmas backdrop, Christmas In Connecticut may be one of those movies that ends up being too nicey nicey and inoffensive for some people (especially in the way that the moral codes of the day are rigidly adhered to while others begin to think that they're being broken) but it remains, for this viewer at least, a real delight and a wonderful light comedy perfect for winter entertainment. Barbara Stanwyck plays Elizabeth Lane, a successful magazine writer who lives on a Connecticut farm with her husband and lovely young child and is just a model housewife and mother, as well as being an amazing cook. Dennis Morgan plays Jefferson Jones, a war hero who is keen to feel just what a traditional home should feel like, and Elizabeth's boss (Alexander Yardley, played by Sydney Greenstreet) arranges for the both of them to spend Christmas with Elizabeth and her family on the farm for Christmas. One small problem - Elizabeth DOESN'T live on a Connecticut farm, she has no husband, has no child and has no talent when it comes to cooking meals (she gets all of her amazing recipes from her friend Felix, played by S. Z. Sakall). Obviously, it's going to be a big job to survive the holiday season. Directed by Peter Godfrey, and with a cracking script by Lionel Houser and Adele Comandini (based on a story by Aileen Hamilton), Christmas In Connecticut starts off by delivering a message of seasonal cheer to the audience and then backs that up with almost every moment of the film's runtime. The cast are all pretty good, with only Reginald Gardiner (as John Sloan, a rather dull architect who helps Elizabeth by letting her into his Connecticut house and arranging to marry her - he even has a baby or two available) being a bit of a damp squib. That's probably as much due to his boring character as it is to the acting but I was always eager to get back to any scenes involving Stanwyck, Morgan, Greenstreet or, especially, Sakall. Even Una O'Connor, an actress I have sometimes found more irritating than amusing, was great fun in this frothy farce. You never really worry that things aren't going to turn out as they should (signposted by a couple of gratuities) and the stress level never overshadows the constant amusement but that's why this is so endearing. It sets out to be a pleasant, entertaining, Christmas comedy and with some great scenes here and there, great characters, some fun lines and plenty of snow, well, that's exactly what it IS. Stanwyck in Top Form in a Holiday Staple After a Slow Start; After excelling as cinema's most malevolent femme fatale - bleached-blonde, anklet-wearing Phyllis Dietrichson - in Billy Wilder's classic 1944 noir, \"Double Indemnity\", Barbara Stanwyck was understandably looking for something lighter to balance out her enduring screen image at the time. Finding instant relief in this 1945 screwball farce that has since become a holiday TV staple, she plays Elizabeth Lane, a popular homemaking magazine writer who doles out Martha Stewart-type cooking advice to the unsuspecting masses who haven't a clue that she's really a lonely working girl who lives in a cold-water Manhattan flat. Things get immediately complicated when her demanding publisher Alexander Yardley, desperate for a boost in circulation, insists that she entertain a wounded soldier who fantasized about her bountiful dishes out in the Pacific. The problem is compounded by the fact that she has completely fabricated her life of domestic bliss on a Connecticut farm where she is supposed to be happily married with a baby. Yardley is not aware of her web of deception, so Elizabeth uses the luxuriant farm owned by her paramour wannabe, John Sloan, whom she agrees to marry in return even though she doesn't love him. She convinces her best friend Felix, a first-class Hungarian chef who has been plying her with his recipes, to come to the farm to give her a crash cooking course. Needless to say, bedlam ensues when the soldier, Jefferson Jones, shows up at the farm two hours early, but of course, so does romance eventually at a local dance and then on a most romantic sleigh ride. Love and truth eventually sort themselves out at the end. In a strange way, one could look at this holiday rom-com as the flip side to \"Double Indemnity\" since both revolve around the concept of a woman fooling others to get her way, but this time, she's a single gal who wants a husband instead of a married one who wants to dispose of one. Directed by Warner Bros. studio journeyman Peter Godfrey and co-written by Lionel Houser and Adele Comandini, the film lacks a certain finesse that an Ernst Lubitsch (\"The Shop Around the Corner\") would have provided in spades. What's more, the initial set-up feels tacked-on with the food-fantasizing Jones first on a life raft with a fellow soldier, then getting rescued, and gradually recovering in the hospital. It runs perilously close to a half-hour before we even get a glimpse of Stanwyck's character. That's a bit of a shame since she's terrifically likable and a game farceur in her typical no-nonsense way. A studio favorite at the time, former band singer Dennis Morgan (\"In This Our Life\") plays the smitten Jones well enough in an undemanding role. The usually menacing Sydney Greenstreet (\"The Maltese Falcon\") has a good time playing the pompous Yardley, and the unforgettable S.Z. \"Cuddles\" Sakall (\"Casablanca\") lives up to his name as Felix. Memorable as the Southern-fried, skirt-blowing chanteuse in \"The Awful Truth\", Joyce Compton plays the nurse who attempts to entrap the food-desperate Jones into marriage. The 2005 DVD includes the original theatrical trailer and an Oscar-winning short, \"Star in the Night\", a then-contemporary retelling of the Nativity story set in the Southwest desert. A True Holiday Classic; Personally, I don't like a lot of b/w movies, but there's something magical about this movie. The movie starts with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). \"Liz\" writes a magazine column about how she's the 'Martha Stewart' of Connecticut. Of course, she's lying. This becomes a problem when her publisher, Mr Yardley, asks her to play host to a NAVY sailor over Christmas. In addition, Mr Yardley, who's going to be alone for Christmas, invites himself up to the farm for the Christmas party. From there, things just go crazy. Since the movie is set on a New England farm, the movie has a warm holiday feeling. Plus, the characters are hilarious. Mr. Yardley is always shouting orders, and Liz's friend Felix is always yelling 'Catastroph!' when things go wrong. Finally, the movie ends the way a Christmas movie should end; a jolly fat man laughs and shouts \"What a Christmas!\" In short, no matter what age you are, you will love this movie. honky donkey!!!; This is my favorite Christmas movie. I love it. I have friends over to watch it. I watch it in June. I'm definitely not a fan of Hollywood propaganda wartime films but this transcends the others. The war is a background to the sweetest holiday film ever made. Stanwyck is great as the slightly unscrupulous writer, Greenstreet is great as her boss, Morgan is incredibly likable, Una O'Connor is Una O'Connor, Gardiner is OK as,I guess,the villain, but for me the star is S.Z Sakall (who refused to have makeup applied to his ears). His lines include: \"She put the watch in his mouth\". \"Kidneys!!!\" \"Now it's goulash\". This is the warmest Christmas film I have ever seen. It's one of the few films where I think, \"I wish I was there.\" The house they are staying in is the perfect Christmas cottage. The meals they prepare are perfect. The whole feeling of the film is the embodiment of Christmas. So to sum up, this film is VERY HONKY DONKEY!!! A delightful Holiday film!; I absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home. The trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a WW2 hero as guests during the Christmas Holidays. Why is she worried? Because she lives in a small New York apartment, isn't married, and doesn't have a baby - and can't cook at all! Hilarity (and romance) ensues when she tries to put on a believable act in an effort to save face/ keep from being fired by the magazine owner (played by Sydney Greenstreet). This is a delightful comedy; one that I highly recommend to classic movie lovers!!!! Fine actors, contrived story; I found this movie disappointing. Which surprised me, because I like most of the actors and they do a decent job here. So what's the problem? Well, it all just seems too contrived. Barbara Stanwyck is fine as the female lead, although I don't see this as one of her outstanding performances (and there were many). Dennis Morgan is pleasant, as he always was; I typically enjoy him in a film. Nice to see Sydney Greenstreet taking one of his lighter roles. Reginald Gardiner, not always one of my favorites, is fine here as the husband to be (?). S.Z. Sakall plays S.Z. Sakall (he was no actor...always played the same role...but was adorable). And, Una O'Connor was as delightful, as always. So, the problem is not the actors. The problem is the script. Sort of a screwball Christmas story...but not quite. Disappointing in terms of romance. It had its funny moments, but not that many moments strung together. The only thing that really comes together in the story are the contrived circumstances. I'm not saying it's a bad movie. It's okay. Pretty average. But as much as I love a good Christmas movie, this just didn't light my Christmas tree. Okay to watch...once. You'll always want to say, as did Santa Claus, Ho, Ho, Ho! after seeing this.; This is a film that truly and nostalgically shows us the America of the 1940's, even as the two great supporting actors, Sydney Greenstreet and S. Z. Sakall hailed from Europe, and the screenplay co-author's parents had gone through Ellis Island. Now for a detail or two. The address of Felix's restaurant was carefully presented as was often the norm at that time: 1. The 300 block is too far away from Fifth avenue. 2. We are not shown if this is East or West from Fifth avenue. 3. The better restaurants are usually in the 50's, not the 40's. That way, you might not be forlornly looking for it. Later on, perhaps for financial reasons, Barbara Stanwyck appeared in a TV western, whatever it was, and so younger viewers may not always know what a great actress she was during the 1940's, the golden age. After seeing this, you might even be wondering, why don't we occasionally have horses and buggies anymore? An Undeservedly Neglected Classic; Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility. The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he exercizes control over his employees -- until the Christmas spirit overtakes him. The role is a 'walk in the park' for Greenstreet who had been one of the stage's great Falstaffs when he was part of the Lunts' company. Greenstreet had only entered films five years earlier when, at age 61, he was featured in what was to become a film classic, the first and best film John Huston ever directed: 'The Maltese Falcon'. 'Cuddles' Sakall was probably never better in his traditional role as the embodiment of middle European gemutlicheit. The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem. Stanwyck the Great; Completely charming comedy not really devised to be a holiday classic and all the better for it. Barbara Stanwyck, coming fresh off of Double Indemnity, is a breezy delight. Of the great studio female stars, Davis, Crawford, Hepburn etc. she was probably the most versatile. She's surrounded by a wonderful cast all experts at what they do. Sydney Greenstreet famous of course as a villain was actually a well known comic stage actor for years before The Maltese Falcon and was always anxious for a chance to show that on screen and he is having fun here. Dennis Morgan is a good match as the romantic lead and he did have a beautiful tenor voice. The situation is a tad incredible but then it's not really meant to be anything serious to begin with. Something to watch to get the holiday spirit without being swamped by all the trimmings. Transporting And Delightful; From the perspective of the hectic, contemporary world in which we live, the so called `good old days' always seem so much more serene and innocent; an idyllic era gone by of which we have only memories and shadows that linger on the silver screen, as with `Christmas In Connecticut,' a warm and endearing film directed by Peter Godfrey.  Barbara Stanwyck stars as Elizabeth Lane, a popular `Martha Stewart' type magazine columnist who writes about life on her beloved farm in Connecticut, always with the latest recipe at the center of the story.  One of her biggest fans is Alexander Yardley, played by Sidney Greenstreet, the publisher of the magazine for which she writes.  Yardley has never visited her farm, and in response to an idea expressed to him in a letter from a nurse, Mary (Joyce Compton), he decides to spend an old fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth, her husband and child and, as a special guest, a certain Mr. Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor just recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his ship was torpedoed.  Elizabeth of course cannot refuse her boss, but there are problems; not the least of which is the fact that she has no farm and writes her column from the comfort of a high-rise in the city.  It makes for a precarious situation for her as well as her editor, Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne), as the one thing Mr. Yardley demands from his employees is total honesty.  What follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that transports the audience back to a seemingly more simple time and place, to share a Christmas Past where a warm hearth, good food and kindness prevail. Barbara Stanwyck absolutely sparkles as Elizabeth, with a smile and presence warmer than anything the grandest hearth could provide, and totally convincing as a city girl entirely out of her element on the farm.  Morgan also fares well as the somewhat naive sailor, whose trust in his fellow man is admirable.  Even with the deceptions being played out around him, he's the kind of guy you know will somehow land on his feet, and in the end it's Elizabeth you really feel for.  One of the true delights of this film, however, is Sidney Greenstreet.  His Yardley has a gruff exterior, but beneath you know without a doubt that this is a man with a heart as big as Texas.  It's a straightforward, honest portrayal, and it's a joy to watch him work; the most memorable scenes in the movie belong to him. The supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), the terrific Una O'Connor (Norah), Frank Jenks (Sinkewicz) and Dick Elliott (Judge Crothers).  A feel-good movie that plays especially well during the Christmas Season (though it would work any time of the year), `Christmas In Connecticut' is a memorable film that never takes itself too seriously, is thoroughly uplifting and will leave you with a warm spot in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be.  It's a true classic, and one you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.  Good morning; Merry Christmas. I hope I'm in time to see you flip the flapjacks.; Christmas in Connecticut (AKA Indiscreet) is out of Warner Brothers and directed by Peter Godfrey. It stars Barbara Stanwyck, Dennis Morgan, Sydney Greenstreet & Reginald Gardiner. Plot sees Stanwyck as Elizabeth Lane, a successful writer of a love, marriage and food column for popular Smart Housekeeping magazine. As far as her readership is aware, Elizabeth lives in domestic bliss out in the country, tending the family home for her husband whilst raising their bonnie baby. The truth, however, is that she doesn't do any of those things, in fact she's hopeless and lives on her own in a modest Manhattan apartment. A problem now since her boss, who is none the wiser, has invited himself and a war hero fan of Elisabeth's writing, to her \"Connecticut\" farm for Christmas. Roping in some friends she hatches a plan to not get found out, but it's not going to be easy to pull off, no sir, not easy at all. Frothy and breezy slice of screwball that does a good enough job at yuletide without really breaking out of its routine chains. Stanwyck is excellent (in a role first offered to Bette Davis), managing to keep the audience on Elizabeth's side in spite of her less than stellar scruples. There's a number of enjoyable set pieces, and enough knock about energy to raise a few laughs. While the makers have nicely played around with the myth of a domestic goddess and the expectation of such from male suitors. The trouble with the film, mainly, is that the direction is not creative enough for the complexities of the story, the deceptions at its core soon become boorish due to overkill. Sure it's lively, but running thru a number of set ups at pace is not enough if the staid dialogue and predictability of it all hangs heavy. One can imagine just what Howard Hawks could have done with this set up. Still, it's a safe recommendation at Christmas time, and certainly a must see for fans of the versatile Stanwyck. But once the end credits have rolled it ultimately feels like a Christmas tree without the trimmings. 6/10 Stanwyck generates a little bit of fun; Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) is a single NYC food writer who is famous for her articles about her fictional Connecticut farm and family. She doesn't know how to cook. Her friend chef Felix Bassenak (S.Z. Sakall) gives her the recipes. The publisher Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) insists that Elizabeth host a Christmas dinner for returning war hero Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan). Her editor Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne) fears being exposed. In desperation, Elizabeth reluctantly agrees to a loveless marriage to the insistent John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner) and somehow get a baby before the dinner. The story is rather boring until Stanwyck starts faking in Connecticut. The war hero isn't very compelling. Dennis Morgan is not that special as a leading man. It takes awhile for the movie to set up the premise and there are no good jokes in that section. The loveless marriage is kinda sad. The movie finally gets to Connecticut after 30 minutes and it takes awhile for the comedy to pick up. Stanwyck has some fun as she fakes a modern-day Martha Stewart starting with changing the baby. Great Holiday Movie -- How About A DVD Release; This is such a wonderful holiday movie and is only available on VHS and during the holiday airings on TCM.  I bring it out every year and watch it several times.  It has a wonderful cast of Hollywood's best including Sydney Greenstreet, S.C. Shagal and Barbara Stanwyck.  Three holidays have passed since I bought my DVD player but yet this movie still has not been released on DVD.  If Warner Brother's still owns the release rights to it...please release it soon on DVD.  Thanks. A must-see Christmas classic!; This is my personal favorite of all the Christmas movies. It's an endearing story, but not sappy. There's plenty of humor, and the characters are smart and witty and work well together. Definitely a house favorite. All the actors show their comedic talents well (especially Barbara Stanwyck), and how can you not love Uncle Felix?! Hunky-dunky! OK, Barbara Stanwyck was quite good; Wasn't anyone else bothered by the fact everyone seems to be having so much fun, but the two mothers of infants were having to work long days, on Christmas eve and Christmas day ? Barbara Stanwyck, as always, was excellent in this type of role. Uncle Felix (SZ Sakall) was really my favorite. A supporting actor who seemed to really get into the part. (Doubt this is really a spoiler) I never did quite get how at the end, Yardley came to accept a less than honest author writing for his magazine. That seemed to be contrary to all of his principles. (This is a spoiler): How in the world did Mary Lee (the nurse) get married, with her former fiancé just gone for the weekend ??? Guess my suspension of disbelief was a little weak for this Christmas movie. Barbara lightens up.; Rating. Eight out of ten. Not a blockbuster, but rather delightful. Barbara's reputation. She is a very tough cookie in other films, and many times portrays quite an unlikeable character. She is not sentimental, in the stereotyped image I have of her. Barbara as a real woman. I remember Barbara in later life, in The Thorn Birds, portraying an elderly woman in love/lust with a young priest (horrors!). She is wealthy, and wants to rule the world of her rural fiefdom. She wants to control her whole world. She, Barbara, is jealous of a younger woman who also lusts after said priest. Elderly Barbara admits that the young priest causes her to melt into jelly, and that, if I remember, she feels she is surely soon going to hell because of her sinfulness. True lies. In this film, Barbara is a fake food columnist for a magazine. She isn't fake, but the food doesn't exist. She is a total klutz in the kitchen. Just imagine if some of today's well known chefs couldn't even boil water or fry an egg. Barbara is nicer here than in some of her other films that people remember. She is even rather naïve here, and almost sympathetic/nice. Swoon. Dennis Morgan was a real hunk. He was a lovely singer, witness his role in My Wild Irish Rose. My fave Jack Carson is missing here, but if competitive Jack had vied for Barbara's hand in this film it would have just been confusing. Dennis and Jack, that irascible pair, would have been totally hilarious playing off each other and opposite Barbara. They could have both been fighting over her. Hope and Crosby knockoffs, indeed. Do a song and dance, Jack and Dennis. The old soft shoe. The feed bag. Dennis' food in the hospital was horrible. His friend's was better. Worse food than Dennis' was the doctor-recommended diet of the Sydney Greenstreet character -- a cardboardish pile of nothingness that Greenstreet abhorred. Was Greenstreet's menu item turnip mousse or soufflé or something like that? Shades of JFK. In this film, Dennis is stuck at sea on a raft after being attacked in World War Two. I am reminded of JFK and his famous similar situation. Consider if JFK had ended up like Dennis's character: crappy food in hospital, while fantasizing about Ms. Perfect Cook from a magazine -- and the bimbos are trying to hook up with him. Sexism: women should not be judged for cooking ability or other outdated marriage qualifications. Let the man learn how to cook. Then he can blame himself for burned meat or boiled over coffee. The woman should not have to wait on the man hand and foot. Rosie doesn't roll up her sleeves. The World War Two stereotype of women is Rosie the Riveter who works in a factory. In this film however, Barbara, the lead woman, actually has a career away from the manufacturing plant. She has a salary, not an hourly wage. Maybe she is a college graduate. Meanwhile, the babies' mothers actually work in factories, from what I remember. They are certainly not the main protagonist of this film. They are in the background, and seldom appear. Two fat men. SZ Sakall was the real chef in this film. It was funny when he called Greenstreet The Fat Man, because Sakall was no Skinny Minnie. It seems Sakall was always somebody's uncle or buffoonish financial adviser. Sydney trying to be an almost lovable curmudgeon. Greenstreet was a mean guy in other films, but here he was actually sort of funny in spots while trying to stay gruff and scary in others. Dennis deft with the infants. The two babies were different than each other. One had dark hair, and one had blonde hair. Morgan had a way with the babies, while Barbara didn't know how to bathe them or do anything else with them for that matter. Eight out of ten. One of my top 5 favorite Christmas movies; While it's not \"perfect\", it's close. Love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Superman's police chief), the housekeeper, the waiter at Restaurant Felix, and the judge......I can go on and on. This movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition since I was a youngster, and my children grew up with it, too! \"The baby swallowed the watch\" was always my son's favorite line. Sexy Barbara Stanwyck in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly, funny S. Z. Sakall. Dennis Morgan has a few great songs, too. I highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake (blah). The Vidiot Reviews...; Christmas in Connecticut When cooking tofurky for Christmas remember to baste it in Nyquil to get that tryptophan feeling. Or, you can do like the journalist in this comedy and tell your cook to do it. Writing bogus copy about her husband, child and Connecticut farmhouse, food columnist Elizabeth (Barbara Stanwyck) must now materialize these lies to host a war-hero (Dennis Morgan) for Christmas dinner - at the behest of her oblivious publisher (Sydney Greenstreet). Marrying a friend (Reginald Gardiner) who owns a country house, hiring a chef (S.Z. Sakall) and borrowing a baby, she plays house with great incompetence. Struggling to maintain her façade, her infatuation with the soldier and the dinner menu, her house of cards starts to crumble. A sophisticated screwball comedy in a picturesque snowy countryside setting, Christmas in Connecticut is a neglected holiday gem. Incidentally, the biggest tell she isn't a real food writer is her sinuous frame. Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca wonderful holiday film that is just sweet; This film reminds me very much of the later Rock Hudson film MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT--about a fishing writer who has NEVER fished and is forced into entering a fishing tournament. In this case, Barbara Stanwyck is a Martha Stewart-like writer who can't cook and doesn't really have the perfect family she describes in her articles--in fact, she has no family at all. Well, like Rock, she is maneuvered into performing--in this case, creating a huge holiday dinner while vacationing in the countryside. Since there is no family, she takes home a veteran and a few friends and tried desperately NOT to \"let the cat out of the bag\" that she can't do any of the things she is known for doing. A cute little comedy and a welcome film to the annual holiday film lineup. a must-see for Christmas!; \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is an absolute gem, and a must-see for Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, a precursor to Martha Stewart, is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakers--the perfect wife, mother, and domestic goddess. Only thing is, she is none of these things--a total phony. Unfortunately for her, she is about to be found out. Her publisher, Mr. Alexander Yardley (a brilliant comic turn by Sydney Greenstreet) gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to Elizabeth's \"perfect farm\" for the Christmas holiday. Only thing, there is no farm, \"perfect\" or otherwise. The comedy involves how Elizabeth is to keep her real identity under wraps so she will not lose her job. Elizabeth's colleague, John, happens to have a farm in Connecticut, so that solves that problem. However, he wants to marry Liz, but she does not want to marry him. He offers her marriage, though he knows she doesn't feel the same way about him that he does about her. He makes the offer anyway, and assures her that he is willing to wait. And here Barbara Stanwyck, as Liz, delivers one of the most devastating put-downs I have ever heard. With perfect innocence, she replies: \"Could you wait that long?\" OUCH! In addition, the scenes between Una O'Conner and S.Z. Sakall are hilarious. They don't seem to like one another (though one suspects they really do). They are rivals in the household, and S.Z. Sakall's mangled English is equaled by Nora's strangled pronunciation of his name (\"Mr. Basternook\"). \"My name is FELIX!\" It is amazing how Christmas-y these black and white films are. Great character work by all involved. Don't miss this one! My Mother's Favorite Holiday Movie; My mother loved Barbara Stanwyck; in fact it was the only reason we watched \"The Big Valley\". But while \"The Big Valley\" was pure crap, \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is a heartwarming, fun little movie that I watched with my mother every year in the 80's and early 90's. Now it's difficult to find anywhere. I wonder why? The gorgeous Miss Stanwyck was as good as usual, and all the other players are great. It ranks right up there with \"White Christmas\" as a true holiday classic. They should bring it back where it belongs. A Yuletide Man's Favorite Sport; It finally hit me watching my VHS of Christmas in Connecticut what other film this one reminded me of. If it weren't for the fact that the other was done 20 years later, I'd say it was a remake. Just as Rock Hudson was a phony fishing expert for Abercrombie&Fitch who had to get some on the job training at a fishing tournament, Barbara Stanwyck plays an forties version of Martha Stewart. Stanwyck's a cooking columnist who's built up this whole image of living on a small Connecticut farm with husband and baby cooking all these marvelous delicacies. Trouble is she's unmarried, childless, writes her column from her apartment in New York and doesn't know how to boil water. But her writing is a hit with the public. Trouble comes when she's hijacked into cooking a home Christmas dinner for a war hero sailor played by Dennis Morgan who gets to sing a couple of songs as well. Got to keep up the image at any cost. And her publisher Sidney Greenstreet likes the idea so well that he invites himself to the dinner. So with borrowed farm, baby, and Reginald Gardiner who'd like to make it real with Stanwyck she tries to brazen it through. Christmas in Connecticut's now a Yuletide classic and deservedly so. The leads are warm and human and they get great support from the assembled players. S.Z. Sakall as the Hungarian restaurant owner/friend of Stanwyck from whom she gets her cooking information and Una O'Connor as the housekeeper have a nice chemistry between them. Reginald Gardiner and Stanwyck have no chemistry at all, obvious to all but Reggie and he's funny in his stuffed shirt way. Most people remember this film as one of Sidney Greenstreet's few ventures into comedy. If he's not an outright villain, a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon, Greenstreet is few other things on screen. Christmas in Connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to burlesque his own image and he made the most of it. In a biography of Barbara Stanwyck, she mentions she enjoyed making Christmas in Connecticut as a welcome change from some villainous parts like Double Indemnity she'd been doing recently. One of the things that made doing the film so enjoyable was that between takes, director Peter Godfrey and Greenstreet would do some impromptu entertaining of cast and crew with English Music Hall numbers. Made for a relaxed and warm set and the cast responded accordingly. Now if only someone had been filming those numbers. Christmas in Connecticut; Spunky, fun Christmastime balderdash has popular magazine article writer Barbara Stanwyck stuck in the predicament of hosting a faux Christmas Eve/Day homemaking extravaganza for her boss (Sydney Greenstreet) and a war hero (Dennis Morgan) who survived (along with a fellow soldier/pal) on a raft on the ocean for several days without food\n",
       "the problem is she isn't the amazing cook, sensational mother, and superb farm-marm that leaps from the pages of her articles. The real cook with all the gourmet dishes isn't Stanwyck but SZ Sakall from Budapest who is fortunate enough to benefit from her fame. Sakall will accompany her to a farm supplied by architect Reginald Gardiner (he is always habitually asking Stanwyck to marry him) if Stanwyck will marry him. Reluctantly, she will but her betrothal to Gardiner keeps getting delayed by Sakall who knows she doesn't love him. The child is brought by to be babysat by a mother who works at the war factory (female one day, but the next is a different worker with a male baby!), so Stanwyck (who doesn't know a thing about being a mother) must wing it, aided (much to her delight) by Morgan (he grew up with children and knows how to bath and feed them). The problem that arises for Stanwyck is that she falls head-over-heels for Morgan and must somehow steer her affections/lust for him away and focus on successfully fooling Greenstreet into believing she is actually exactly as she claims. The whole comic angle is Stanwyck masterminding this grand charade even as her behavior and heart yearn for Morgan. Greenstreet expects what he reads in her articles to be articulated in person and Stanwyck must find ways to escape. This is designed like a screwball comedy or something you might see from Preston Sturges. There's constant activity, evasive maneuvers, close-calls, daunting tasks demanding think-on-your-feet (or just plain luck) responses, lots of wooing and romanticizing, and unexpected developments (baby is \"kidnapped\" by his actual mom much to Greenstreet's dismay; the male-female baby change; Greenstreet expecting Stanwyck to \"skillet a flapjack\" in his presence; the \"theft\" of a horse carriage that lands Morgan and Stanwyck temporarily under arrest) that complicate matters further. Stanwyck had a magnetic screen presence even in films like this that feel like holiday, feel-good fodder, perhaps considered a notch or two behind the Lady Eves and Ball of Fires, but I thought \"Christmas in Connecticut\" would be easy to go down with some eggnog and cookies. It has that holiday atmosphere (the farm is idyllic and snowy, the house is elegant, there's the decoration of the gigantic Christmas tree, the piano-played carol, and the cast are breezy and fun to watch). When you are needing something Christmassy for a night in December, this is as entertaining a film as I could recommend\n",
       "it has all the ingredients without schmaltz or melodramatics. All the parts fit to make this comedy romance a Christmas classic; Some classical stories (novels) have been so popular for so long, that they are remade into movies every so many years. The stories remain virtually unchanged, but the cast, script and sets change. The most obvious of these is Charles Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol.\" That literary and holiday classic lends itself very well to new productions, much like the works of Shakespeare. On the other hand, some specific movies have become favorite classics or are so part of our annual traditions that the casts have become ingrained in the stories. One can't see anyone else playing certain roles. One of the most obvious of these is Frank Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" We can't imagine anyone other than James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, and Henry Travers playing the roles they had in that film. \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is another such film. Although it hasn't reached the stature of Wonderful Life, this film has become a holiday classic as well. It is a favorite of mine. Those of us who have seen it a number of times over the years can't imagine anyone other than those in its cast playing the roles in the film. Barbara Stanwyck is Elizabeth Lane, Dennis Morgan is Jefferson Jones, Sydney Greenstreet is Alexander Yardley, S.Z. 'Chuckles' Sakall is Uncle Felix, and Reginald Gardiner is John Sloan. Even beyond the main cast, some supporting actors are so good and right for their roles, that they have become 'ingrained' in the parts. These include Una O'Connor as Norah, Dick Elliott as Judge Crothers, and Robert Shayne as Dudley Beecham. This movie came out less than a month before Japan's surrender and the end of World War II. It was nearly 1 ½ years ahead of \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" There are no war scenes in \"Christmas in Connecticut,\" but the war had a strong influence and part in the plot of the film. The war that had ended had nothing to do with the plot of \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" While both films have Christmas settings, their stories and intended audiences are quite different. \"It's a Wonderful Life\" is all family entertainment, with strong seasonal appeal to children as well as adults and strong moral and human overtones. \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is a very good romantic comedy that is adult all the way. It's approved viewing for children as well  very clean and proper. But the humorous script and sequences are written for adults. It doesn't have tremendously clever dialog with witty wisecracks and comebacks. Rather, it has clever lines that fit visual situations. The film has some hilarious sequences. Watch for Uncle Felix, Elizabeth and Sloan at the buffet table in the restaurant. Another is at Alexander Yardley's home, between him and Elizabeth  and then the butler and Elizabeth. Judge Crothers pops in and out of scenes in a funny sort of cat-and-mouse series of scenes. Then there's the Connecticut square dance. And Yardley's dialog with Sloan about the former's ability to detect lies and fraud. The farm cow plays in another humorous sequence. Elizabeth and Jones have a wonderful sequence, warm and funny, with the baby. Later, the baby switches lead to all sorts of mayhem and humor. There are more, from the opening scenes of two sailors adrift after their ship is torpedoed, to the very end. I noted some reviewers thought the plot was too contrived or silly. I think it's an excellent plot, very well contrived, with several specific twists that fit together perfectly to make it work. This is not an uproariously funny film. It's a warm, entertaining romantic comedy. Its turns with the truth, marriage, fidelity and other virtues are obvious to an adult audience. So, we don't take them as serious but as part of the humor of the plot. Nor is this a film of funny characters. Stanwyck, Greenstreet and Morgan are mostly straight characters, although Greenstreet has some very humorous dialog in a couple places. The only standout humorous role is that of Uncle Felix. To a lesser degree, Norah and Dud are comedic roles. The comedy is mostly in the lines of these three characters, and in the physical responses and scenes with the others. To that extent, Stanwyck and Greenstreet are especially good in their straight roles that lend to the comedy. Greenstreet is a riot as the prudent overseer of morals and propriety of his columnist employee, Elizabeth. This is a most enjoyable film. Its transparent plot seems very straightforward. Yet I seem to discover something new to enjoy each time I watch this movie. I heartily recommend it for anyone who hasn't yet seen it. One viewing should suffice to make it a part of your annual Christmas holidays list. Here are a few snippets of the fun and funny dialog that I enjoy. Elizabeth, \"Dud, we're going to be married.\" Dud, \"What? Hey, now, look here Elizabeth, it isn't that bad.\" John, \"Oh, really, Beecham.\" Judge Crothers, \"I suppose you'll give the bride away, Uncle Felix?\" Felix, \"Me  I don't give nobody away. Always, I keep my mouth shut.\" Butler, \"Pardon me, Mrs. Lane. \"I'm planning on having a farm in Connecticut myself one day. I'd like some good bottomland.\" Mrs. Lane, \"Bottomland?\" Butler, \"Yes. That's the best for farming, isn't it?\" Mrs. Lane, \"Oh, some people say yes, and some people say no.\" Butler, \"But what do you say?\" Mrs. Lane, \"Uh, I'm inclined to agree with them.\" Butler, \"Oh, thank you very much.\" The Best Holiday Movie; It's fun and fast paced, as one falsehood leads to another and another toward an inevitable, surprising conclusion.  The suspense separates this Holiday flick from all others.  One wonders how the pieces are going to fit, both during the movie and in the future. The character actors laid the foundation and entertained us in the process. Sinkewicz (Frank Jenks) shows us what manipulation can get...and ultimately what manipulation can cost!  Uncle Felix (S.Z. Sakall) sizes up each person for us while trying to protect \"Lishka\" (Barbara Stanwyck), and this helps us decide who we are going to root for in the end. If we could ever achieve a perfect world, imperfect people would likely have to undergo a series of events such as these. A glaring weakness is that fake baby cry after it allegedly swallowed Uncle Felix's watch.  I've heard more authentic crying from a doll in a toy store. Watch it, and you'll really feel like you've been somewhere! The Moonlight and the Snow\n",
       "and the Cow; The destroyer of Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan) and his partner Sinkewicz (Frank Jenks) is sunk by the Germans and they float adrift in a raft for eighteen days. When they are rescued, they are sent to a hospital and Jefferson has to follow a stringent diet imposed by the doctors. He seduces his nurse expecting to get solid food and she decides to write to Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet), who is the owner of the Smart Housekeeping magazine where the famous journalist Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) writes a column about recipes and food, asking him to allow Jefferson to spend Christmas with Elizabeth and her family in her farm in Connecticut. The prepotent Yardley sees the chance of free promotion of his magazine and forces Elizabeth to invite the hero Jones. However, Elizabeth is single, does not have a baby and lives alone in a small apartment in New York and she made-up a perfect married life for her fans. Further, she does not how to cook and the recipes belong to her Hungarian friend Felix Bassenak (S.Z. Sakall), who owns a restaurant in New York. The architect John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner), who has been wooing Elizabeth for a long, proposes to marry her in his farm in Connecticut and she brings Felix with her to help to proceed the farce. The things get complicated when Yardley also decides to spend Christmas with Elizabeth while she falls in love with Jones. \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is a delightful and witty comedy of errors about a famous food writer that makes up a fictitious life and has guests to her world. I have just bought this DVD and it was the perfect entertainment for a rainy Sunday afternoon, with hilarious situations and wonderful performances. \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is indeed a must- see for the Christmas period. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): Not Available Christmas Great; Christmas in Connecticut (1945) *** (out of 4) Delightful comedy about a female journalist (Barbara Stanwyck) who writes a column claiming to be a great wife, mother and cook. Things get out of control when her boss (Sydney Greenstreet) invites a WW2 vet (Dennis Morgan) over to her farm for Christmas. The problem is that Stanwyck is single and doesn't really know how to cook so now she must try and push the scam over. This is a highly delightful, charming and cute little film that isn't too heavy but isn't too light either. This is my favorite role I've seen from Stanwyck who manages to be tough yet charming as well. The real benefit to the film is the wonderful supporting performances by Greenstreet, Morgan, S.Z. Sakall, Robert Shayne and Una O'Connor. The romance side of the film works perfectly and the film contains many classic scenes including the babies bath as well as the cow getting loose. The only problem is the final twenty-minutes take too long to play out. Just Use the Old Magoo; \"Christmas in Connecticut\" isn't exactly the best Christmas movie (Seriously, how many Christmas movies are really *that* good?  Even \"It's a Wonderful Life\" is pretty schmaltzy and manipulative when you think about it), but it does the trick.  It's cute and gets a little bit more enjoyable every year I see it.  The Christmas angle seems kind of thrown in--almost as if someone at Warner Bros. said, \"Hey, we can get this thing released in December rather than January if we just rewrite a little of it and set it at Christmas.\" Anyway, don't pass up \"It's a Wonderful Life\" or \"A Christmas Story\" for this one, but I'd recommend it just the same. Remember:  The Magoo will get you in, and the Magoo will get you back out. Snow-White Lies; Let's hear it for serendipity: In a shop specializing in Region 1 dvds I stumbled across one of those pantechnicon boxed sets, this one featuring four Christmas-themed movies. The selling point in my case was The Shop Around The Corner, which I have seen several times on TV but never owned and the set also boasted three other titles that were either new to me (It Happened on Fifth Avenue) or titles of which I'd heard of but hadn't seen, like this one. Okay the leading man was something of an acting joke, wooden as both Punch and Judy combined, but Barbara Stanwych seldom lets you down and if she was having an off-day here (she wasn't) Sydney Greenstreet, S. Z. Zackall, Regineld Gardiner and Una O'Connor were running interference and there was no way they could all be lousy at the same time. The premise was that Stanwyck plays a character based loosely upon Gladys Taber who, for several decades wrote a column in Family Circle in which she did little more than chat in a homely way - and/or dispensed 'Butternut Wisdom' about her farm in Connecticut, lacing the text with recipes, gardening tips etc. The twist in the film is that Stanwyck writes her column from Manhattan, couldn't boil water without burning it, would require an illustrated recipe to make toast and relies on the expertise of restaurateur Zackall to provide the cooking tips/recipes. She's doing all right if anybody asks you until the owner of the magazine, Greenstreet, decides not only to spend Christmas on the fictitious Stanwyck farm but also to bring war hero Morgan to supply the human interest angle. Luckily Regineld Gardiner, who has been pursuing Stanwyck unsuccessfully for years, just happens to have a farm in Connecticut which he is prepared to 'lend' Stanwyck should she agree to marry him, and naturally there is room also for Zackall to do the cooking. Now, of course, it's just a matter of waiting to see how long Stanwyck can keep the balls in the air, or how many near-misses she can survive. There's a lot of charm at work here and it's sobering to think that in 1945 this could have easily got lost in the shuffle at a time when they were churning out stuff like this at the rate of half a dozen a year whilst today it beckons like an oasis in a desert of mediocrity. Highly recommended. Old fashioned Christmas romance with a \"modern woman\" touch; I have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites...it has all the charm, 1940's quaintness, and good old fashioned romance and it's hilarious, to boot! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking\\home life articles for a famous magazine...under the premise that she is a married homemaker. Even the president of the magazine is under this delusion. Enter a handsome GI, (played by the talented Dennis Morgan)just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy. His simple wish is to stay at the homey Inn the she writes so eloquently about and relax with her famous home-cooked meals. She now has to frantically find a way to save her job and reputation...add to this that her fiancé is in a hurry to tie the knot doesn't help. The humor is superb and the chemistry between the leading characters a lot of fun. Throw in the character-actor nicknamed \"Cuddles\" (who fits this name completely) it becomes even more adorable. This has become my must-see movie that I snuggle in with a cup of cocoa each Christmas season. A wonderful, enjoyable movie to enjoy at Christmastime or anytime! Despite the Christmas theme, the film is really about the pressures on a single woman to marry...; Nationally-read woman columnist, an ace cook and homemaker on a farm in the country, is in reality a single gal in the city who relies on her restaurateur uncle to create all her recipes. After a handsome war hero expresses interest in her dishes, a publicity meeting is devised, wherein the columnist must whip up a rural home, a husband, a baby, and a cow! Highly concocted scenario with an unlikely set-up is just about saved by Barbara Stanwyck's smart, assured performance in the lead and some funny business from the supporting players. There's far too much confusion in the third act, with incidental characters (and babies!) entering and exiting excitedly, and Sydney Greenstreet is saddled with the impossible role of Barbara's publisher, the nosiest old busybody in the cinema! Still, there's a sweet (if ready-made) romance between Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan...and when the picture settles down and allows them to talk naturally like real people, the results are wonderfully engaging. **1/2 from **** classic but dated; Nostalgia is the primary reason to view this film. The plot is too cute, the storyline too improbable and the comedy not particularly funny. I think there may have been perhaps two or three times I smiled but most of time thought a well made for TV flick is more entertaining. However, if you like Barbara Stanwyck and want to return to a more innocent, naive time devoid of faxes, computers, etc. this film is for you. Actually the cast does quite a good job with the lines they have to deliver but most of the plot points elicit groans rather than guffaws. The home in which most of the action takes place is very impressive, but like the plot, unrealistic. Most people, even today, don't live this good. The film is a fantasy, but so over the top it simply no longer works. An annual must-see; Forget Jimmy Stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead.  I suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and Stanwyck's other great Christmas story, \"Meet John Doe\" aren't revered with the same level of love as...well, you know it's name. Stanwyck plays a food writer for a McCall's-type rag who has been lying for years to her pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes.  She's an ace b.s. artist until the day Morgan's sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days afloat & 6 weeks recuperation in a Navy hospital.  Released the last year of WWII, the film is dusted with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia but never sinks to sentimentality.  Stanwyck is sexy and sassy as always and meets her match in the hunky Morgan with whom it's love at first sight.  Unfortunately, she has to play married to Gardiner's prissy architect who actually has been seeking her hand for years at his farm in CT, just to fool her boss. S.Z. Sakall adds a great deal of Hungarian malaprop & double-entendre humor in support as Babs' true source of culinary talent & Una O'Connor is hilarious as Gardiner's obnoxious Irish housekeeper. Another Christmas Classic \"Found\" on TCM!; Like \"It Happened on 5th Avenue\", I never saw this movie until TCM showed it at Christmas time! Nobody else shows black & white movies! Like 5th Ave, it revolves around an ex-serviceman and love at first sight. A \"Betty Crocker-Martha Stewart\" type magazine columnist writes about her lovely country home and down-home recipes. She is a complete fraud as she lives in a NYC apartment and gets all her cooking tips from her Hungarian restaurant owner \"Felix\", very well played by character actor S.Z. \"Cuddles\" Sakal. So, Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) gets caught in a lie and has to fabricate the whole thing, right down to the country ranch, husband and baby. All fake. She's single, childless, and lives in the city. Along comes a Navy hero who gets invited to her \"home for the holidays\". She can't even boil water, so \"Felix\" tries to teach her to cook, complete with flapjacks stuck on the ceiling! As mentioned, she falls in love with the Navy guy and the movie becomes even better. The sub-plots include her overpowering magazine boss (Sidney Greenstreet), a friend who she almost mistakenly marries, and a borrowed baby who changes sexes and hair colors! It's a \"screwball\" comedy. Great fun for all and highly recommended! The film runs a bit rough on both TCM and the DVD. Horizontal \"wobble\" and minor film damage for the first 20 minutes. It must have been hard to restore! There is also a 1992 TV remake with Dyan Cannon out there, but the original is far better. Excellent screwball comedy; This is a screwball comedy disguised as a Christmas movie. I almost prefer Barbara Stanwyck in this than in the Lady Eve. She is a bit less restrained, a bit warmer. She moves with ease in an almost all male cast. The holiday theme is almost incidental, it definitely takes a sideline to the charade in the house of her being a domestic goddess. Barbara Stanwyck carries the movie right through to the end. Her extra slim figure is pleasing in very simply tailored clothes. Your heart almost sinks for her when she is going to be married to the very droll architect. The actual farm setting is fun and makes it more believable. Not very well known, but not to be missed. The best Christmas gift one can receive!; This Christmas gift arrived courtesy of TCM. We had never seen the film, even though we have seen most of the films of Barbara Stanwyck. This comedy made us laugh so much, that at times, we had to restrain ourselves, in order to hear the dialog. This is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations, especially around Christmas. It would certainly lift one's spirits by just letting go. The movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a DVD, or a VHS tape. \"Christmas in Connecticut\" was directed with great panache by Peter Godfrey, based on a story by Aileen Hamilton. The best thing in the movie is the felicitous pairing of two of the most popular stars of that era: Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan. Barbara Stanwyck always played strong willed women, obviously, this was a change of pace for her. In this film, as well as \"Lady Eve\", Ms. Stanwyck displays a knack for comedy. She and Mr. Morgan, who played in a lot of musical comedies, make a winning combination. There are no weak performances in the film. Sydney Greenstreet, an actor notorious for playing 'heavies', is a delight to watch as the rich, and fat, Alexander Yardley, the man who owned a media empire and who knew a good thing when he saw it. Reginald Gardiner, an accomplished English actor, adds luster to the stellar cast behind the two principals. S. Z. Sakall, is another source of continuous mirth; he plays the Hungarian chef Felix,who has a hard time with his own version of the English language. Also, Una O'Connor makes a perfect Norah, the housekeeper in the Sloan perfect Connecticut farm. In reading other comments in this forum, it's sad to learn that the glorious black and white cinematography is not appreciated by some people. After all, color was not widely used in the 40s, and most of the classic movies have to be seen in its original format because, what would be accomplished in 'coloring' them? This film should be a requirement for anyone looking to spend almost two hours of uninterrupted fun at Christmas time because total merriment is assured. Watch it with an open mind and heart an maybe you'd like to see \"Christmas in Connecticut\" every year. Stanwyck & Comedy Do Not A Perfect Yuletide Combo Make; If nothing else, this decidedly silly, light-weight RomCom from 1945 will certainly entice you with all of its talk (as well as its presentation) of food-glorious-food. Your mouth will water at the sight of some of the delectable meals that are placed before your famished eyes. But, with that said, I found this somewhat screwy Chick Flick wasn't exactly the sort of cold-climate story that's guaranteed to warm your heart, nor put you into the Christmas spirit, or anything like that, at all. But, still, this film does have its entertaining moments, even though its plot was just a wafer-thin \"Girl-Gets-Boy-To-The-Altar\" story with a predictable, token \"happy ending\" conveniently tacked on for good measure. This piece of airy fluff has Barbara Stanwyck playing character Elizabeth Lane, a chic, NYC writer for Smart Housekeeping magazine, who's got her naive readers believing her to be the most ideally perfect homemaker on the face of the planet (but, in reality, she's far from being that). This standard studio corn has Miss Lane cornered into entertaining both a dashing, young war veteran and her overbearing boss in a cozy, but posh, Connecticut home for the holidays. Filmed in b&w, this offering from Warner Bros. has a running time of 100 minutes. To Spend Christmas in Connecticut; I've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise. A Christmas Classic,it's also one of the fine comedies of the 40s. The story line is simple : Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine. At Christmas time, her boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the Connecticut farm she write about. The only problem is : She hasn't got any farm and she can't cook. To get out of the jam, Elisabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend (Reginald Gardiner,who has a farm) and flies for Connecticut with her wonderful cook Uncle Felix. There's a fine direction by Peter Godfrey and the cast is really wonderful : Stanwyck has never been better as this witty and yet romantic woman. Greenstreet, Gardiner and Sakall make hilarious and human supporting characters. The only weak point is the leading man, Dennis Morgan. He starts well but as the movie goes on, becomes really a bore. One almost feels sorry for Elisabeht Lane to ends up with him rather than with Gary Cooper or David Niven who both would have been more suitable for the part. Anyway, this is a joyful Christmas time movie with a refreshing score and I advice it to everyone who likes to spend funny and sweet Holidays...in Connecticut. Holiday Screwball; A magazine columnist who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a NY apartment must come up with a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, it turns into an entertaining little screwball comedy, thanks to a fine cast. In a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in \"Double Indemnity,\" Stanwyck displays a nice comedic flair. Morgan is smooth as the affable war hero while Greenstreet is well cast as the publisher. However, Sakall steals the film as a chef trying to master the English language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible European accent. A film full of holiday fun!; Make sure you make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season! If you admire Dennis Morgan or Barbara Stanwyck, this film is a fun one to watch. They really work well together as you would see in this movie. The whole cast was very entertaining. Since I'm a Dennis Morgan fan, this film was a real treat! But...everyone can enjoy it! Recommended! Great Romantic Christmas Movie!!!; I came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday films. As you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed on for it. Stanwyck is great as bride to be that is having second thoughts. Dennis Morgan's acting is strong also. He goes unnoticed in most films but was a very capable actor, check out KITTY FOYLE. In this film he plays the visiting sailor that woos Stanwyck away from her husband to be. This is a Christmas classic. The settings and the story make for a great Christmas romance Stanwyck and Morgan team up with a great cast; Every time, I see Barbara Stanwyck I am more impressed with her acting, whether in a dramatic or comedy role. Her talent combined with her beauty make any of her movies hard to pass up. In this holiday film, Christmas in Connecticut, she is delightfully paired with Dennis Morgan and the incomparable Sydney Greenstreet and a wonderful supporting cast that includes Una O'Connor and S.Z. Sakall. The story is about a New York columnist who pretends to live in a Connecticut country home as the perfect wife and mother. Her publisher, Sydney Greenstreet, unaware of the truth, is a man who likes the image that she uses because it appeals to his readership and sells newspapers; however, he too is seduced by the image and invites himself to spend a Christmas in Connecticut to enjoy the pleasures of a New England country Christmas. He is joined by Dennis Morgan, home from the war, where he was just rescued at sea. This is where the plot becomes complicated for Stanwyck and her male friend, Reginald Gardiner, who poses as her husband. They are forced to construct a front of domestic bliss in Connecticut with servants, livestock and children brought in as props to complete the image for the publisher's Christmas holiday. Dennis Morgan is superb as the war vet and when paired with Stanwyck, there is a real chemistry between them that leads to further complications. We find some amusing situations, as the facade unravels with babies, boyfriends and farm animals all playing a role in the hilarious Connecticut household. Morgan and Stanwyck find themselves in an awkward situation and Greenstreet starts to question Stanwyck's respectability as a wife and mother. This is one Christmas movie that Christmas movie fans should see - amusing and well-acted holiday entertainment. Reality? Who needs it?; This is how people killed time before they invented television. It is called a \"B movie,\" the companion in a double feature to the movie people were actually willing to pay money for. You didn't worry over little details like making the story believable; these stories exist in an alternative B movie universe. And so we see in the opening two sailors adrift for 16 days. The nurse says they were without food for 16 days, yet in the next breath she talks about how they had K rations, up to some point. Jeff gave his companion the last of the K rations, and now he is being kept off solid food for 18 days, while his buddy has been feasting on steak and turkey for days. Does this make sense? So how does the Nurse Sadist console him? She reads him a magazine article about a seven-course meal, complete with roast duck, after serving him warm milk and a raw egg! In my universe, he would have strangled her, but in the B universe, the sailor pretends to fall in love with Nurse Sadist. (Now, in reality, when liberating Nazi concentration camps, doctors found that if starving inmates were fed high protein food right off, they died because the kidneys were overloaded. So they started them out on a light broth, etc., for a couple of days.) And these are the problems with just the first six minutes of the movie. By eight minutes, the nurse is ready to marry him and is bringing him steak, and all he did was say her name and that he missed her. Now, why didn't any of the other dozens of sailors in the ward think of that with such a dumb blond (she can't even win at tic tack toe)? Sure, you've got to be willing to suspend disbelief, but for an old B movie, this is easier if you aren't exactly paying attention to the movie, if you know what I mean. In the year 2013, what this means is this is a chick flick, a suitably romantic movie to watch with a brainless girlfriend. At 12 minutes, just when many in the theater are about to put on their coats, Sidney Greenstreet appears, and the plot thankfully thickens. At 14 minutes, we have two more stars, and the first of two black actors in small but non-stereotyped roles. We are beginning to see the DNA of this Christmas movie: a Warner Bros. picture, the rebel outfit. Underlying the story are jabs at more conventional movies like Holiday Inn - 1942, also set on a farm in Connecticut, and Meet John Doe - 1941, A Frank Capra flick which also features Barbara Stanwyck as a mink coat wearing reporter who concocts bogus stories. And there is a jab at a real life food writer, Gladys Taber. This is what people watched before TV, and after, for the B movie became the basis for brainless sitcoms; from these humble roots sprung such masterpieces as I Remember Lucy, The Beverly Hillbillies and Gilligan's Islands. Perhaps that's why this storyline seems so hackneyed: 60 subsequent years of TV sitcoms. Realty? A most inconvenient distraction. Call me old fashioned, but I believe there should be some sort of internal logic to a movie's plot. In Christmas in Connecticut, there's none. Things just happen, mostly for the convenience of the lazy writers, especially the ending. (Spoiler alert) It makes no sense, but everyone seems to be happy, or at least relieved, as far as I can tell. It is a bit confusing because the writers just tie up a bunch of loose ends with some very fast dialog - The End. Hey, if you enjoyed the movie, if it made your Christmas merrier, that's great. But if you've never seen this movie, you haven't missed anything. And aside from the fact that they say it is Christmas, there is nothing particularly Christmassy about this movie. Heck, it came out on August 11, four days before the Japanese surrender. Actually, this is a bit odd, when you think about it. Until they dropped the atomic bombs on Japan, it looked like the war would run another year or two. With the war over, showing this movie in Dec. 1945 would seem dated, especially as people would be tired of thinking about it. Just another of many elements about this movie that don't quite fit. Yes, that's good!; Charming film, funny, and leaves you with a real feel-good feeling.  Does anybody know why all those babies in 1940's films look so . . . well, homely? I like S.Z. Sakall (spelling?), and I LOVED the part where he asks the African-American waiter if \"catastrophe\" is good.  The waiter's reply is so intelligent, you just know he's going to med school nights on the GI bill or something.  This is something simply not seen in films of this era, and it floors me every time.  I wish it could have happened more often . . . \"Are you crazy? Where am I gonna get a farm?\"; For the longest time I thought I'd already seen this picture, but reading the cast list when it appeared on a cable channel listing, I realized that wasn't so. I must have been thinking \"Holiday Inn\", having a similar style setting and taking place in Connecticut. Both also have a story that defies credibility, though this one has more humorous elements to make it a fun, breezy offering. Veteran actors step out of their usual film personas to create interesting characters here. Barbara Stanwyck usually goes for the strong willed woman type while Sydney Greenstreet often portrays a more somber character. I don't know how many times it might have happened, but this is the second time Greenstreet happened to be called a 'fat man' in a picture. He had the same distinction as Signor Ferrari in \"Casablanca\", a movie in which S.Z Sakall also appeared doing a humorous bit similar to the one he performs here as Felix Bassenak. You know, I think the screen writers missed an opportunity when they brought in the second baby to confound the guests at the Sloan residence. Wouldn't it have been neat if Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan) had to change the baby one more time and discovered that he had a spare part? Why didn't they think of that? Well as holiday films go, this one skirts the idea by virtue of taking place around Christmas time, but the tree is in place with the presents underneath, and even offers up \"Oh Little Town of Bethlehem\" as one of the musical offerings. If you decide to tune in, don't get mixed up like me and confuse it with other holiday flicks that show up around the same time of year. Especially when the opening scene begins the story on a German submarine! Lies, Lies And More Lies; There were so many classic movies that were made where the leading people were out-and- out liars and yet they are made to look good. I never bought into that stuff. The \"screwball comedies\" were full of that stuff and so were a lot of the Fred Astaire films. Here, Barbara Stanwyck plays a famous \"country\" magazine writer who has been lying to the public for years, and feels she has to keep lying to keep her persona (and her job). She even lies to a guy about getting married, another topic that was always trivialized in classic films. She's a New York City woman who pretends she's a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies, etc. Obviously she knows nothing and the lies pile up so fast you lose track. I guess all of that is supposed to be funny because lessons are learned in the end and true love prevails, etc. etc. Please pass the barf bag. Most of this film is NOT funny. Stanwyck was far better in the film noir genre. As for Dennis Morgan, well, pass the bag again. Christmas nostalgia with perfect dialog; This is our favorite Christmas movie, and we watch it every year. Actually, Christmas is kind of incidental. There is nothing religious or Santa Claus related about it, although there is a prominent Christmas tree in the living room, and Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) has trouble decorating it; also, the war hero, Jeff (Dennis Morgan), sings a Christmas song at one point. It is definitely winter, though, in all its Hollywood splendor. There's realistic-looking snow galore and horses and sleighs to glide through it. The event sequences are pretty incredulous, but this is a farce, and farces are not supposed to be believable. What I like most is the acting -- all of the actors are perfect for their parts -- and the dialog. The dialog sequences fit together like a perfect puzzle. There is one hilarious scene after another, and the fast pace never stops until the end. While the final result is not surprising, the way it's carried out is. Besides Stanwyck playing off Morgan, there's an interesting relationship between Uncle Felix (S.Z. Sakall) and Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet), two outstanding actors who also played in Casablanca. Sakall is an excellent character actor who is not that well known, but I hope to find him in more movies. Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide only gives this movie 2.5 stars, but I think it is worth at least 3.5, if not 4, stars as one of the most hilarious 40's comedies and an excellent Christmas season film. Christmas in August; It was interesting to watch a holiday movie in August. I do think these stories should air year round and not just in December. I had never seen Christmas IN CONNECTICUT all the way through. Well, now, I finally have. I found myself focusing on S.Z. Sakall's performance as Felix the cook-- you know, the guy who says \"everything is hunky-dunky!\" But in addition to Sakall, the rest of the cast shines too-- and it's obvious they were all having fun making this film. There's a lot of screwball comedy here, and the dialogue is just so intentionally silly in spots that you can't help but love it. Sakall's scenes with Stanwyck are quite good, but his scenes with Greenstreet are even better. And there's a scene at his restaurant early in the film where he walks around and doesn't have dialogue. If you watch that part carefully, you will see a great bit of improvisation. Truly one of the best character actors in Hollywood during the 1940s. Very enjoyable film.; I have seen this film several times and never tire of it. It is a witty and clever film and does not need sex or violence to make up for a lack of talent. The whole family can view it and simply enjoy it. A charming old-fashioned Christmas movie with modern 40's ideals.; Barbara Stanwyck probably didn't think of it, but it is a relief to see her in a more becoming dark hairstyle (if it wasn't a wig) than the one she had to wear in \"Double Indemnity\" the year before. That film, while the premiere \"film noir\" and an all-around great film, gave her a great role, but oh, that hair. Here, she is more chic and certainly no femme fatal, but she is certainly a 40's woman. She has gotten used to life without men since most of them are off at war, and as a successful Martha Stewart like columnist, she writes a homey column in which she describes her country home as the camera pans over what it really is. We meet her boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea that she is living a lie, and when he pushes his way in for a Christmas away at her supposed Connecticut home, she has to come up with a husband (Reginald Gardiner) and baby before we can say \"Jingle Bells\". Hungarian chef S.Z. Sakall steps in to help and ends up in a cutsey pie one-on-one with Irish Una O'Connor. \"It's not Goulash, It's Irish Stew\". Sakall simply takes the paprika, pours most of it in, and says, \"Now it's goulash\", totally changing what she has prepared for lunch. Then, when it comes to the flapjacks, he flips and she scoops. For years, a few friends of mine and I will use that line every time pancakes come up in a conversation. \"I don't flip. I scoop!\". She won't even flip just one for Greenstreet, saying \"I've never flipped in me life.\" O'Connor can get on the nerves when she screeches over and over in some films, but here, she is delightfully lovable, and her pairing with Sakall is very charming. It is obvious in the romance department that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwyck's cup of tea, especially when she meets handsome Dennis Morgan, who is a bit dimwitted when bathing the baby, which eats soap, causing Stanwyck to get a bit alarmed. He should suspect something instantly, but doesn't. But it doesn't matter. The film is so charming with the country setting filled with snow, an abundance of rocking chairs, and a dog running towards them as the sleigh comes up. Living in New York City after 25 years in Los Angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of New York State made me miss this kind of Christmas. While Central Park is beautiful after a first snow and the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is exsquisit too, there is something about looking out at a snow-covered field of trees, and catch an occasional glimpse of deer, rabbits, or other wild life. This is a great holiday film that can also bring on the Christmas spirit out of season, and makes a great pairing with another Barbara Stanwyck country Christmas film, \"Remember the Night\", an underrated gem. Add on the big city Christmas of \"Meet John Doe\", and you've found perhaps one of the busiest stars of holiday films around. A Christmas Classic; \"Christmas In Connecticut\" is a gem of a Christmas movie classic. While lesser known than some others -- it is nonetheless a delightful way to spend an evening at holiday time. I watch it every year. Barbara Stanwyck is perfectly cast as, Elizabeth Lane, the single, career girl. Way before it was popular, Stanwyck embodies the single girl on the rise. Her NYC apartment, and her friendly \"uncle\" restaurateur around the corner typify the single girl in the city existence. She can't cook yet she writes a homemaking column for a magazine! Dennis Morgan is also perfectly cast as our wartime hero, Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet the amazing Elizabeth Lane. After being lost at sea, all he wants is to spend Christmas in a \"real\" home. Which sets up the delightful, madcap story that evolves. It is fun from beginning to end. We should all have an Uncle Felix too! Christmas Classic; Barbara Stanwyck is a magazine writer of articles on being the perfect homemaker. She's the Martha Stewart of her day. Unfortunately, she's also a huge fraud. She can't cook and doesn't even have the family she writes about! When she's put in the position of having to make a big Christmas dinner for her publisher (the always excellent Sydney Greenstreet) and a war veteran (Dennis Morgan), she scrambles to keep up the ruse of her \"happy homemaker\" image. Funny Christmas romantic comedy helped by a superb cast. Stanwyck and Greenstreet are terrific, as usual. Dennis Morgan is very good as the poor soldier who hasn't been allowed to eat solid foods and is salivating at the thought of a big Christmas dinner. A great supporting cast including S.Z. Sakall, Robert Shayne, Una O'Connor, Reginald Gardiner, and the adorable Joyce Compton. This is definitely a must-see Christmas classic for everybody. Great Romantic Comedy; This is a wonderful romantic comedy. Barbara Stanwyck's timing is right on. All the characters are top notch. The architect gets a little predictable but plays his srole well. Dennis Morgan has an incredible voice and we get to hear him twice.I just love Uncle Felix! A movie for all seasons; Though it's a Christmas movie, \"Christmas in Connecticut\" could have been done any time of year, as it's the story of a soldier who spends what is to be an idyllic time with a Martha Stewart type. That's what he thinks. In reality, the lady in question, portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck, has a popular magazine column about life on a farm with her husband and baby. She has no farm, no husband, and no baby, nor are the many recipes she publishes hers. They belong to the restaurant owner nearby. When her no-nonsense editor, Sydney Greenstreet, insists that she entertain soldier Dennis Morgan, she enlists the aid of her boyfriend to use his farm, and she transports herself and the restaurateur there. There's even a baby...well, actually, there's more than one. Chaos ensues, and the charade becomes increasingly difficult to play out, especially when Stanwyck falls in love with Morgan. This is such a wonderful movie, and even if you're gravely depressed, \"Christmas in Connecticut\" can lift you right out of it. Barbara Stanwyck is wonderful as the career woman turned homemaker. Despite not being as flashy as Crawford or Davis, she was nevertheless able to do what any role called for - she could be cheap, elegant, warm, nasty, cold, and/or sexy and she makes it look easy. On top of that, she is always attractive and alluring. Dennis Morgan is a handsome and charming solider; as an added bonus, he gets to use his Irish tenor. Fiancé Reginald Gardner is all business, and you can tell he's not quite right for Stanwyck. S.Z. Sakall as the fake uncle/real chef is hilarious, especially as he prays Stanwyck can flip a pancake before an audience. I can imagine the impact this delightful film had at the tail end of World War II. It must have been a real beacon for the better times to come. Ultimate Christmas movie; I first saw this film about 15 years ago, and I have been enchanted by it ever since. It is such a feel-good experience, that I could happily watch it at any time of the year. However, to me, it is the ultimate Christmas movie. The fact that it is in B&W is irrelevant - although I often wonder what it would be like in colour. You can just get that warm, glowing feeling watching the Christmas events unfold. Stanwyck and Morgan are perfect together, and Greenstreet is the antithesis of his usual character, Sakall is a blustering joy to watch. It is light relief and certainly does not tax the brain, but leaves you feeling glad that you saw it. I can't wait for it to become available on DVD in the UK. I shall certainly be at the front of the queue to buy it. hunky-dunky; I just got this movie for Christmas and have already added it to my favorites list.  A cute and simple story which makes a beautiful movie. Who could not love Uncle Felix or not have their mouth water at the sound of all that food.  Definite points go to Sydney Greenstreet for his performance of Alexander Yardley and also to Reginald Gardiner who played John Sloane, the impossibly boring fiancee. Truly a gem to be watched every Christmas. Christmas Con Job; I've always liked Barbara Stanwyck who was, perhaps, the hardest working lead actress of the 30's and 40's although few of her movie roles are memorable. Today she is remembered most for the TV show \"The Big Valley\". Stanwyck worked so much because she was durable; it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence. And so it was for \"Christmas in Connecticut\" a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isn't even really about Christmas. It does, however, have Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan as well as some supreme character actors including Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. Sakall so there are plot twists and funny moments which undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than they do today. To begin, the plot concerns a magazine writer (Stanwyck) who the magazine's readers believe is a domestic goddess, married with a child and living on a farm in Connecticut but who is really single, lives in New York City and knows nothing about cooking or homemaking. Could anyone get away with such a fraud even then? Apparently, and even the owner of the magazine (Greenstreet) is deceived although one would think that he would have long since seen though the deception but the story moves on and Stanwyck, Greenstreet, a sailor recently survived from his sunken ship (Morgan) and Stanwyck's restaurateur friend (S.Z.Sakall) find themselves spending Christmas in Connecticut at a farm belonging to Stanwyck's boorish boyfriend (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine all the possibilities there are for this as the fraud unwinds as it must. Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the rouse but one wonders how she can stand him at all. Morgan and Stanwyck fall for each other but he is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married. Regardless, they begin what seems to be a make believe affair dancing cheek to cheek and stealing off in a horse drawn sleigh. Meanwhile, the incredibly naive Greenstreet character who has seen Stanwyck and Morgan go off together but still doesn't get it sees one of the neighbors take back a child that has been borrowed as part of the deception and calls the cops to report a kidnapping. Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the sleigh and the hoax begins to unwind. At this point the movie is funny as in ridiculous or absurd, not funny ha,ha and it routinely ends like screwball comedies always did. The good guy gets the girl and presumably they live happily ever after. I watch this movie every year at Christmas to enjoy these character actors at their best in a story that reflects way it was in 1945 and because of a long held fascination with Barbara Stanwyck. Thank goodness it was set at Christmas or like 95 percent of Stanwyck's movies it would have been long ago forgotten and we would not get to see it each year anew. Who \"Elizabeth Lane\" was REALLY  based on.; At the time that this movie was made most housewives knew exactly who Barbara Stanwick was parodying.Today only some women over 50 probably remember Gladys Taber,whose column \"Butternut Wisdom\" ran in Family Circle Magazine from before World War II until the 1970's.She lived on Stillmeadow Farm in Conecticut,and her columns were collected into a number of books,Stillmeadow Seasons, Stillmeadow Daybook, etc. The lines that Barbara Stanwick recites as she types them for her column are quite typical of the ones that began a typical Gladys Taber column.Besides cooking and country living,she got rather nostalgic and philosophical at times.She talked a lot about her favorite dogs, mostly cocker spaniels.You might say that Martha Stewart is the Gladys Tabor of today. Christmas is Connecticut may not be any cinematic masterpiece,but it is pleasant,lighthearted entertainment,soothing to the stressed out mind,and that is good enough Martha Stewart is a Fraud; No need to wait until Christmas to watch this laugh a minute film. In this film a War Hero is invited to a life style magazine writer who is a Martha Stewart before there was a Martha Stewart. She makes all her meals look like fine dinning. Her articles talk about her private life which includes her marriage and her child. The problem is that she is lying. She is not married and can't cook. When her boss demands that she take in the war hero she is up the creek. Other problems include that she doesn't have a child. It is a very funny film that you should see! This is the film that many situation comedy show have stolen from. Not Enough To Be A Christmas Classic; \"What a Christmas\" is the closing line of this movie, coming from the lips of Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) - a magazine publisher who's just experienced what probably would indeed have been his most confusing Christmas ever. Unfortunately, the last line just didn't quite capture my feelings about the movie. It's not that this is a bad movie. Quite the contrary - it's a very pleasant seasonal film, but that may be its biggest problem. It's up against some pretty stiff competition in terms of Christmas films, and there was nothing in particular about this that would make me want to watch it again and again. We have certain holiday traditions in our home, some of which do revolve around watching certain movies. \"A Christmas Carol,\" \"Miracle On 34th Street,\" \"It's A Wonderful Life.\" They're all annual events. Even a more recent piece of comedy such as \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" shows up in our house every year. \"Christmas In Connecticut\" was fun to watch once, but I can't see doing it every year. The story had the potential to be funnier than it turned out to be. Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) is a magazine columnist, who offers cooking and homemaking tips from the perspective of her life as a wife and mother on a Connecticut farm. The problem is that she has no kids, she isn't married and she lives in an apartment in the city. Everything about her column is a lie, but her boss Yardley doesn't know that, and he arranges to have a sailor who spent 18 days in a life raft after his boat was shot out from under him (Jeff Jones, played by Dennis Morgan) spend Christmas with Lane and her \"family\" so that he can experience a real family Christmas. How to pull this off without Yardley figuring out the truth becomes the plot. It's mildly funny, and Stanwyck and Morgan had a great chemistry. I also enjoyed the performances from S.Z. Sakall as Felix and Una O'Connor as Nora, and spent at least part of the movie wondering if those two would hook up. There's nothing really wrong with this, except possibly to note that at the very beginning of the film Jones and his buddy look awfully healthy for two guys who had been stuck in a life raft all that time! As I said, it just doesn't match up well to the classic Christmas competition. Delightful; This is a delightful, they-don't-make-em-like-this-anymore kind of film. Well performed by everyone and peopled with interesting character actors. An intelligent, witty script acted with the right blend of broad comedy and understated humor. Holds up for repeated (annual?) viewings. **WARNING** the re-make of this film with the same name, directed by Arnold Whatwashethinking, is an unbearable mess - painful to watch - without a scintilla of the charm and wit of the original. A  change of pace world war two screwball comedy; The first half of the 1940's was marked by well known performers from other film genres stepping out of character to star in what may be the last wave of remembered Hollywood screwball comedies still marketed for home viewing and seasonally aired on television. Barbara Stanwyck does her usual professional job as the hard as nails career woman fudging a domestic column for a magazine whose bluff is called in thirties type screwball involving a runaway horse and cow, mixed up babies, Cuddles Szakall stealing the show at every turn with his comic flair and a rural farmhouse which lacks the central iconic focus of every movie advertising the charm of a rural farmhouse - the welcoming, party sized period kitchen. The storyboard is a nonsensical enough fantasy to work yet the editing takes most of the true comic flair out of the film. It seems to me most of the way through a decent musical with at least Dennis Morgan singing once but not truly a top flight comedy. Heartwarming comedy delightful change of pace for Stanwyck; Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy, about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a popular magazine writer's family, at her farm in Connecticut. The problem is she has no husband, baby, or farm, as she writes about in her column, and she can't even cook; her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend \" Uncle\" Felix, owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York City. Things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for Christmas. A scheme is hastily planned, with her stuffy fiancé providing an actual Connecticut farm, neighbors providing a borrowed baby, and a quick wedding planned when the publisher isn't looking. But when the handsome young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve, romantic complications ensue, as the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks for the nice guy Navy man and vice versa. This is a charming, warm film that deftly balances humor with sentiment and is a wonderful showcase for Barbara Stanwyck to display her considerable comedic talent, aided by such marvelous character actors as Sydney Greenstreet, Una O'Connor, S.Z.Sakall, and many others. A Christmas night dance at the town hall is a toe tapping delight to see, and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of Stanwyck is a wonderful surprise, for viewers who have seen her mainly as tough, bitchy women in femme fatale roles. Truly a wonderful film that has stood the test of time. The Ultimate Tangled Web; This is a great movie if you don't mind the discomfort of watching people perpetuate a cover-up. Barbara Stanwyk plays a food editor for a magazine. She has gained a national reputation but in reality has no skills at all. She has been given her information and her recipes from a man she works for. Everything comes to a boil when she is asked to host a man who is a war hero and who is on a special diet at her home in Connecticut. Of course, they have to stage things in order for her not to lose her career and what ensues is one close call after another with people coming and going, trying to cover up for her. This is one of those really fun movies that defies reality but that doesn't matter. Not A Great Christmas Film But Quite Watchable Due To The Assembled Cast; There's some things I certainly love about Christmas In Connecticut, but Barbara Stanwyck really isn't at the top of the list. I've always found Ms. Stanwyck to be a bit too cold to be sweet, a bit too melodramatic to be truly vulnerable to the point of one burning to save her, and polarizing in her beauty which, to me at any rate, was different from either a classic beauty or the girl next door. But, Ms. Stanwyck was without doubt a good actress that could make you watch even if you didn't particularly think she was the lead you wished for. I guess that puts her in a kind of \"rare-air\" actress league? Anyway, this is a simple story with good parts played by an all-round decent cast. It's suppose to be a romantic comedy, but it is light on both the romance and the comedy. Neither gets particularly showcased, but it isn't for lack of trying. A war hero spends weeks on a raft and is celebrated upon coming home. A single-minded magazine business magnate sees an opportunity. His star columnist is a kind of Martha Stewart of the day. Only thing Elizabeth Lane, the columnist, isn't a homemaker, she's just a fine writer of \"fiction\" you might say as she weaves her life to be the consummate cook, homemaker, and mother, none of which is true. It sells a lot of magazines however. This sets up our main story which is the magazine owner insists Mrs. Lane entertains the war hero, Jefferson James played by Dennis Morgan, over a long Holiday weekend. Mr. James will be treated to life with the nation's top homemaker for festive eats, entertainment, and a taste of the American Dream he's fighting for. Well, it's a major predicament and to pull it off Ms. Lane will go to some lengths which include borrowing several infants of different sex, hair color, and size to stand in for her one child. The Christmas element here is kind of incidental in providing a vehicle and it really isn't a movie that celebrates the season too awfully much. I like old movies from this era and as much as anything this is why I like Christmas In Connecticut. The other reason is the always fun to watch Sydney Greenstreet and S.Z Sakall who steal most every scene they appear in. I'm surprised this movie is rated as high as 7.5 (circa late 2016), I feel it's more modest and only as good as a 6.5 because of not the story, but the cast. Not a must see of the Christmas Season, but a nice one for fans of 40's comedies. Charming and Sophisticated; Add this little gem to your list of holiday regulars.  It is sweet, funny, and endearing   \n",

       "      <td>Very slow paced actually dull film; I think the acting for Dano was very spot on but unfortunately it just developed his character and did not advance any storyline very well. The spoiler is that the ending was just a cop-out with the lead character leaving his car, guitar and other belongings to run away. I guess that was supposed to be symbolic of his life in general. I also will almost agree with the other reviewer who said it should have been two short films. I think one really good short film could have been edited from this one film. The fact that reviews need to be ten lines is a foolish rule that needs to be protested and spotlighted for the inane babble that it will foster in that people will write a lot of crap so that they can have their ten lines whereas I think I expressed my sentiments and thoughtful comments succinctly and concisely with just the first five lines of this review and thus I had to write this five line single sentence so that my first five lines might be read and appreciated and that this very long sentence will be admired for the lack of brevity it represents. I think that is ten now. Peace BWadd for ellen; I was intrigued most of the movie,,Just wondering when something was going to give this movies a spark. I am a big fan of So Yong Kim,,Then all of a sudden pops in Ellen (shaylena mandigo)....Movie saver bigtime....This little girl is going to have a big future ahead of her,,,Excellent film ,,,My hats off to So and the cast,,,,Paul Dano and John Heder work very well together in this movie..The music in the bar scene and the toy store scene were my favorite parts,,,Watching Paul and Shaylena work together as an adult child team was excellent....Overall I was extremely impressed with the movie and look forward to more of So Yong Kims work,,,I would rate For Ellen her best movie yet followed by Treeless Mountain,,,,She is an inspiration to all. A poignant and sad movie; As someone who detests most rock music, particularly the screaming histrionics of performers like the one played by Paul Dano in \"For Ellen,\" I was surprised to find myself empathizing with his character, Joby Taylor. As the lead singer in a band, he may be on center stage surrounded by shouting fans, but in this movie we see him against a backdrop of ordinary suburban life, and he seems like a creature from outer space--a weird alien, cut off from the mainstream of life, a stranger in a strange land. It is clear almost from the start that Joby has been reckless, self-centered, and irresponsible. This is driven home like the impact of a judge's gavel when, late in the film, his little daughter Ellen--custody of whom Joby has loudly refused to relinquish to his wife in their divorce negotiations--simply asks, \"Why didn't you come to see me?\" Father and daughter have a precious two hours together at a local mall, and then it is time for him to leave her with her mother. But he returns to the house and sneaks in through the window in order to ask Ellen what she thinks of him. To the end, it is his own self that he is focused on. When she answers that he seems like a nice person, I waited for him at least to say that he liked her too--but he never did. The movie does manage to satirize ordinary middle class life through its portrayal of the young lawyer Fred Butler, played by Jon Heder. This sad sack, who still lives with Mom, seems downright goofy next to the \"cool\" Joby Taylor--to use Joby's term for just about anything that requires his approval. But in being so cool, Joby has lost out on any of the good that comes with ordinary \"un-cool\" life. Paul Dano's performance is outstanding in this film. The director, So Young Kim, lets the camera linger a little too long on bleak landscapes and nearly deserted highways, but her long closeups of Joby Taylor's face are effective, thanks to Paul Dano. The very final sequence is something of a cop-out. Even before we see where it is leading, I knew that it would be a replay of the final sequence in \"Five Easy Pieces.\" And that explains why I have tagged this review with a Spoiler Alert. For Ellen; I am pretty sure that a lot of people will not like this film due to the slow pace but it's most definitely worth a watch. Paul Dano the main actor has done a great job in his career and this is no exception, he carries this film all the way through and although he plays a very passive role you have to look a little beyond this to realise it. A fantastic film from So Yong Kim and the cast. This was visually effective too. One scene that stood out for me was the bar scene (not going into any details for people reading this). Definitely a high rated film and executed well. Make sure you give this film a view. Slow pace does not equal poor movie \"For Ellen\" is proof; Some movies are for fun. Some movies are for adventure. Some movies are art and are actually a \"film\" For Ellen is art. Yes it is slow, yes it has few words and little action. This film is about emotions that do not need laughs and action to be nurtured. Dano is approaching Oscar level acting at a very young age. I can't wait to see his skills grow and deepen. This movie is sad because that is what the characters are feeling! It is powerful and emotional and really well made. I don't have much else to say except that a lot of movie goers expect to be surprised with original twist and plot turns, but are not impressed with deliberate quality. This film is deliberate and delivers quality. Not without my ...; I can see that some people don't like the movie. It is really slow paced and the main actor seems more passive than anything. But it's only the surface that looks that \"boring\". I think the main actor (I've seen him before in a few other features) is doing a pretty good job. And he has to, because he carries the movie on his shoulders. His drive has to be convincing (even though it's not that apparent as I said before) for the viewer. Heder has a small role, but the character he portrays could easily be a Napoleon Dynamite offspring. Still he does have a few laughs to offer (laughs that might not sit well with some people I guess). I really like the idea and the execution, but try it, before you buy it A mediocre short film, another one of divine power, both featuring a wonderful performance; For Ellen feels like the combination of two short films, both roughly thirty minutes in length, that were each injected with fifteen minutes of filler. The first short film (or act), running more-or-less forty-five minutes long, tells the story of Joby Taylor (Paul Dano), the lead singer of a second-rate rock band, battling for a divorce suit with his wife out of court. This leads to multiple mental breakdowns of Joby, many lawyer meetings discussing settlements and entitlements, and long shots focusing on Joby's often sulky, bitter face in close-up. It's long and tedious. The second short film is predominately centered on Joby and his six-year-old daughter Ellen (Shaylena Mandigo), who he learns he'll lose entire custody of if he signs the current settlement at hand. He takes her out for a few hours, awkwardly asking her about her likes and dislikes, and simply trying to get to know her personally, before he potentially cuts off any and all communication with her. It's sensitive, extremely well-done material. Paul Dano is a serious and convincing screen presence, considering his age and how actors usually mature with time. Dano hit the ground running with his first major performance as Dwayne in Little Miss Sunshine, a teenager who decided to take a vow of silence until becoming a pilot and then discovered devastating news. His roles have treaded the line of bravery, assuming the role of either a conflicted rocker, a trouble but optimistic teen, and even the bold voice of reason. His Joby here is, in his own way, an anti-hero; we're not very fond of him because of his \"deadbeat dad\" status, yet we can see his act of reconnecting with his child as an audacious and daring one. Since he is one of the only characters we meet and focus on during the film, a lion's weight of its quality rests on his shoulders. His performance is often a roller-coaster of emotions for the viewer, however, what somewhat waters its quality is the writing, which is ponderous, vague, and largely forced impressionism. For Ellen falls into the category of an indie film that is smart for not trying to do too much, yet kind of dumb for not doing enough. It plays everything too safe. The long close-ups of Dano, many of them unsteady, wobbly, and victim to a shaky camera, try to provide us with sentimentality and intimacy during traditional scenes which a film like this doesn't really need then. The scenes with Joby and Ellen are much more structured and stable, in terms of camera angles, yet if there's any time they should be unsteady and rather imperfect, it should be then; not at the beginning of the film, when the story is brewing and characters are being born. The father-daughter dialog between our title character and her father is simply remarkable. So remarkable I wish I could seriously recommend watching the film from the forty-five minute mark till the end. If there's one film that at least gets props for doing one thing completely right and beautifully poetic, it's the naturalistic dialog between Joby and Ellen. It's all about the incoherency and the small details during these sequences. Take note of how many times Joby says \"um,\" or \"like,\" or stutters when asking her a simple question. He doesn't know what to say and what not say. Would you? Could you have a solid conversation with your six-year-old daughter when you never see her and barely know anything about her beyond her fast name? It'd be horrifying and depressing for the both of you. Writer/director So Yong Kim realizes this and completely amplifies what could've been a contrived, tiresome addition to an already plot less film. Now if only this one small detail or something like it could make the first act work as powerfully well as the second one, we'd have a stronger, more complete picture on our hands. If there's one other thing that bothers me about For Ellen, though, it's the \"make it up\" ending it attaches on there as a means to informally end the film with the idea of you, the viewer, can decide how the story of the characters will continue after these checkered events. It's a pity I can't, technically, recommend the entire film. Say this was actually two short films combined into one. The first one would get two stars for being overlong, dry, and rather aimless. The second one would get three and a half stars for being naturalistic, believable, and entirely realistic. By combining them you get two and a half stars. That's about right in my book. Starring: Paul Dano, Jon Heder, and Shaylena Mandigo. Directed by: So Yong Kim. \"Silent, minimalistic and incisive cinematic letter...\"; Korean screenwriter, film editor, producer and director So Yong Kim's third feature film which she wrote and co-produced, premiered in the U.S. Dramatic section at the 28th Sundance Film Festival in 2012, was screened in the Forum section at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival in 2012, was shot on location in USA and Canada and is a USA production which was produced by producers Jen Gatien and Bradley Rust Gray. It tells the story about a man named Joby Taylor who is a musician in a band called Snake Trouble and who after having travelled around for some time stops at a place where his attorney named Fred Butler is awaiting him and his wife named Claire lives. Claire has filed for divorce and is asking Joby to sign the divorce papers so that they won't have to take the case to court, but when Joby meets her again and realizes that his signature will grant her legal custody of their daughter named Ellen he begins thinking about his child which he doesn't know at all. Subtly and acutely directed by Asian filmmaker So Yong Kim, this quietly paced fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the main character's point of view, draws a gently moving portrayal of a father who has been running away from his responsibilities as a parent and who slowly though perhaps too late acknowledges what his way of life has done to him. While notable for its naturalistic milieu depictions, fine cinematography by American cinematographer Reed Morano Walker and production design by production designer Ryan Smith, this character-driven story about a daughter's meeting with her biological father depicts a reflective study of character and contains a great score by Icelandic composer and producer Jóhann Jóhannsson. This heartfelt, authentic and conversational indie which is set somewhere in America during a winter and where a man whom is about to make a crucial decision regarding his own life which will also affect the lives of others is struck down to earth by a person who alters his life forever, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, subtle character development and continuity, pivotal instrumental tones, humane aura and the genuinely good acting performances by American actors Paul Dano, Jon Heder and child actress Shaylene Lynn Madigo in her debut feature film role. A silent, minimalistic and incisive cinematic letter from a filmmaker who through an efficiently understated style of filmmaking reaches the essence of her characters. A study in closeups where nothing happens; Caught this while flipping through premium channels one afternoon. Dano usually plays the same character, so I was anxious to see if he'd do something different here. He doesn't. I missed about the first 20 minutes of the film, so no idea if anything happened then, but I can assure you nothing happens after. I got rather frustrated waiting for something of interest. In the toy store scene with the little girl, you'll see one of the most painfully slow scenes in the history of cinema. I guess it was rather realistic, but realism can be painful. Dano's character in 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a younger version of his character in this film, but much more volatile and interesting to watch. Perhaps this is a 'thinking man's' movie and I'm just not smart enough for it. I will say that some of the cinematography, particularly with wide shots, was quite well done at least. Paul Dano -istic; Joby Taylor (Paul Dano) is a failed musician who just got divorced. He is estranged from his ex and his daughter. Essentially he is a complete mess. He needs to work out custody of his girl Ellen (Shaylena Mandigo) and in the process hopefully reconnect with her. Paul Dano is able to play this part well. However I think it took too long to get to the girl. It felt repetitive to see him as a loser for that long. It stagnated the film. For the film to work, it needs to get to the girl quicker. I hate to complain about a little girl's performance. But she added very little to the emotional feel. She is stone-faced thru most of her screen time. Although it could be argued that it is called for, it's hard to act back and forth without 1 side participating. Rather static and arid, but above average thanks to Dano's performance; Paul Dano is one of my favorite younger character actors and I have decided to watch all movies with his presence - luckily, it is not impossible as he is selective in taking roles... I like his versatility as well as courage to accept roles not arousing compassion or expanding fame. Joby Taylor is a de facto loser with personal and self-assertion issues without any ideas how to solve the status quo, thus, the pace is slow (often protracted) and events depicted are trivial, amplified by gloomy winter weather and interiors. Dano is constantly on screen, often alone, so the script is more suitable for a stage. Topics like children custody and personal coping are touchy, but it is still not enough for even an independent movie. As for the ending, I got ambivalent feelings as well. To sum up, not bad ideas and splendid starring, but too bleary and daily grind.</td>\n",

She is much improved and the kids really enjoyed the latest movie Barbie the pearl princess. The one drawback the movie is slow paced, lacking in tension and intrigue, and I am scratching my head wondering why the script has been written in this plodding manner. Of course a very obvious way to build up tension is to have a threat of imminent danger hanging over the protagonist's head. But for some reason this did not happen. Barbie sailed through the movie, cut peoples hair, explored the castle, made new friends, and for some reason the \"aunt\" had the threat of danger, as she had to poison the king along with the risk of getting caught. Why this lopsided approach? It did not work. Barbie was in some danger but it did not come across very well. The aunt stole the show in this respect. We all know \"The hero's journey\" And there is nothing worse than a movie in which the hero wants to go on the adventure/quest. The reverse should be; every step must be forced, conflicting emotions, divided loyalties, danger/risk of undertaking the quest versus the big payoff. When Barbie wanted to go to the castle, and did so, this was a major turn off and really hurt the movie. All in all a good offering, probably the best for quite some time.</td>\n",

       "1488  Very slow paced actually dull film; I think the acting for Dano was very spot on but unfortunately it just developed his character and did not advance any storyline very well. The spoiler is that the ending was just a cop-out with the lead character leaving his car, guitar and other belongings to run away. I guess that was supposed to be symbolic of his life in general. I also will almost agree with the other reviewer who said it should have been two short films. I think one really good short film could have been edited from this one film. The fact that reviews need to be ten lines is a foolish rule that needs to be protested and spotlighted for the inane babble that it will foster in that people will write a lot of crap so that they can have their ten lines whereas I think I expressed my sentiments and thoughtful comments succinctly and concisely with just the first five lines of this review and thus I had to write this five line single sentence so that my first five lines might be read and appreciated and that this very long sentence will be admired for the lack of brevity it represents. I think that is ten now. Peace BWadd for ellen; I was intrigued most of the movie,,Just wondering when something was going to give this movies a spark. I am a big fan of So Yong Kim,,Then all of a sudden pops in Ellen (shaylena mandigo)....Movie saver bigtime....This little girl is going to have a big future ahead of her,,,Excellent film ,,,My hats off to So and the cast,,,,Paul Dano and John Heder work very well together in this movie..The music in the bar scene and the toy store scene were my favorite parts,,,Watching Paul and Shaylena work together as an adult child team was excellent....Overall I was extremely impressed with the movie and look forward to more of So Yong Kims work,,,I would rate For Ellen her best movie yet followed by Treeless Mountain,,,,She is an inspiration to all. A poignant and sad movie; As someone who detests most rock music, particularly the screaming histrionics of performers like the one played by Paul Dano in \"For Ellen,\" I was surprised to find myself empathizing with his character, Joby Taylor. As the lead singer in a band, he may be on center stage surrounded by shouting fans, but in this movie we see him against a backdrop of ordinary suburban life, and he seems like a creature from outer space--a weird alien, cut off from the mainstream of life, a stranger in a strange land. It is clear almost from the start that Joby has been reckless, self-centered, and irresponsible. This is driven home like the impact of a judge's gavel when, late in the film, his little daughter Ellen--custody of whom Joby has loudly refused to relinquish to his wife in their divorce negotiations--simply asks, \"Why didn't you come to see me?\" Father and daughter have a precious two hours together at a local mall, and then it is time for him to leave her with her mother. But he returns to the house and sneaks in through the window in order to ask Ellen what she thinks of him. To the end, it is his own self that he is focused on. When she answers that he seems like a nice person, I waited for him at least to say that he liked her too--but he never did. The movie does manage to satirize ordinary middle class life through its portrayal of the young lawyer Fred Butler, played by Jon Heder. This sad sack, who still lives with Mom, seems downright goofy next to the \"cool\" Joby Taylor--to use Joby's term for just about anything that requires his approval. But in being so cool, Joby has lost out on any of the good that comes with ordinary \"un-cool\" life. Paul Dano's performance is outstanding in this film. The director, So Young Kim, lets the camera linger a little too long on bleak landscapes and nearly deserted highways, but her long closeups of Joby Taylor's face are effective, thanks to Paul Dano. The very final sequence is something of a cop-out. Even before we see where it is leading, I knew that it would be a replay of the final sequence in \"Five Easy Pieces.\" And that explains why I have tagged this review with a Spoiler Alert. For Ellen; I am pretty sure that a lot of people will not like this film due to the slow pace but it's most definitely worth a watch. Paul Dano the main actor has done a great job in his career and this is no exception, he carries this film all the way through and although he plays a very passive role you have to look a little beyond this to realise it. A fantastic film from So Yong Kim and the cast. This was visually effective too. One scene that stood out for me was the bar scene (not going into any details for people reading this). Definitely a high rated film and executed well. Make sure you give this film a view. Slow pace does not equal poor movie \"For Ellen\" is proof; Some movies are for fun. Some movies are for adventure. Some movies are art and are actually a \"film\" For Ellen is art. Yes it is slow, yes it has few words and little action. This film is about emotions that do not need laughs and action to be nurtured. Dano is approaching Oscar level acting at a very young age. I can't wait to see his skills grow and deepen. This movie is sad because that is what the characters are feeling! It is powerful and emotional and really well made. I don't have much else to say except that a lot of movie goers expect to be surprised with original twist and plot turns, but are not impressed with deliberate quality. This film is deliberate and delivers quality. Not without my ...; I can see that some people don't like the movie. It is really slow paced and the main actor seems more passive than anything. But it's only the surface that looks that \"boring\". I think the main actor (I've seen him before in a few other features) is doing a pretty good job. And he has to, because he carries the movie on his shoulders. His drive has to be convincing (even though it's not that apparent as I said before) for the viewer. Heder has a small role, but the character he portrays could easily be a Napoleon Dynamite offspring. Still he does have a few laughs to offer (laughs that might not sit well with some people I guess). I really like the idea and the execution, but try it, before you buy it A mediocre short film, another one of divine power, both featuring a wonderful performance; For Ellen feels like the combination of two short films, both roughly thirty minutes in length, that were each injected with fifteen minutes of filler. The first short film (or act), running more-or-less forty-five minutes long, tells the story of Joby Taylor (Paul Dano), the lead singer of a second-rate rock band, battling for a divorce suit with his wife out of court. This leads to multiple mental breakdowns of Joby, many lawyer meetings discussing settlements and entitlements, and long shots focusing on Joby's often sulky, bitter face in close-up. It's long and tedious. The second short film is predominately centered on Joby and his six-year-old daughter Ellen (Shaylena Mandigo), who he learns he'll lose entire custody of if he signs the current settlement at hand. He takes her out for a few hours, awkwardly asking her about her likes and dislikes, and simply trying to get to know her personally, before he potentially cuts off any and all communication with her. It's sensitive, extremely well-done material. Paul Dano is a serious and convincing screen presence, considering his age and how actors usually mature with time. Dano hit the ground running with his first major performance as Dwayne in Little Miss Sunshine, a teenager who decided to take a vow of silence until becoming a pilot and then discovered devastating news. His roles have treaded the line of bravery, assuming the role of either a conflicted rocker, a trouble but optimistic teen, and even the bold voice of reason. His Joby here is, in his own way, an anti-hero; we're not very fond of him because of his \"deadbeat dad\" status, yet we can see his act of reconnecting with his child as an audacious and daring one. Since he is one of the only characters we meet and focus on during the film, a lion's weight of its quality rests on his shoulders. His performance is often a roller-coaster of emotions for the viewer, however, what somewhat waters its quality is the writing, which is ponderous, vague, and largely forced impressionism. For Ellen falls into the category of an indie film that is smart for not trying to do too much, yet kind of dumb for not doing enough. It plays everything too safe. The long close-ups of Dano, many of them unsteady, wobbly, and victim to a shaky camera, try to provide us with sentimentality and intimacy during traditional scenes which a film like this doesn't really need then. The scenes with Joby and Ellen are much more structured and stable, in terms of camera angles, yet if there's any time they should be unsteady and rather imperfect, it should be then; not at the beginning of the film, when the story is brewing and characters are being born. The father-daughter dialog between our title character and her father is simply remarkable. So remarkable I wish I could seriously recommend watching the film from the forty-five minute mark till the end. If there's one film that at least gets props for doing one thing completely right and beautifully poetic, it's the naturalistic dialog between Joby and Ellen. It's all about the incoherency and the small details during these sequences. Take note of how many times Joby says \"um,\" or \"like,\" or stutters when asking her a simple question. He doesn't know what to say and what not say. Would you? Could you have a solid conversation with your six-year-old daughter when you never see her and barely know anything about her beyond her fast name? It'd be horrifying and depressing for the both of you. Writer/director So Yong Kim realizes this and completely amplifies what could've been a contrived, tiresome addition to an already plot less film. Now if only this one small detail or something like it could make the first act work as powerfully well as the second one, we'd have a stronger, more complete picture on our hands. If there's one other thing that bothers me about For Ellen, though, it's the \"make it up\" ending it attaches on there as a means to informally end the film with the idea of you, the viewer, can decide how the story of the characters will continue after these checkered events. It's a pity I can't, technically, recommend the entire film. Say this was actually two short films combined into one. The first one would get two stars for being overlong, dry, and rather aimless. The second one would get three and a half stars for being naturalistic, believable, and entirely realistic. By combining them you get two and a half stars. That's about right in my book. Starring: Paul Dano, Jon Heder, and Shaylena Mandigo. Directed by: So Yong Kim. \"Silent, minimalistic and incisive cinematic letter...\"; Korean screenwriter, film editor, producer and director So Yong Kim's third feature film which she wrote and co-produced, premiered in the U.S. Dramatic section at the 28th Sundance Film Festival in 2012, was screened in the Forum section at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival in 2012, was shot on location in USA and Canada and is a USA production which was produced by producers Jen Gatien and Bradley Rust Gray. It tells the story about a man named Joby Taylor who is a musician in a band called Snake Trouble and who after having travelled around for some time stops at a place where his attorney named Fred Butler is awaiting him and his wife named Claire lives. Claire has filed for divorce and is asking Joby to sign the divorce papers so that they won't have to take the case to court, but when Joby meets her again and realizes that his signature will grant her legal custody of their daughter named Ellen he begins thinking about his child which he doesn't know at all. Subtly and acutely directed by Asian filmmaker So Yong Kim, this quietly paced fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the main character's point of view, draws a gently moving portrayal of a father who has been running away from his responsibilities as a parent and who slowly though perhaps too late acknowledges what his way of life has done to him. While notable for its naturalistic milieu depictions, fine cinematography by American cinematographer Reed Morano Walker and production design by production designer Ryan Smith, this character-driven story about a daughter's meeting with her biological father depicts a reflective study of character and contains a great score by Icelandic composer and producer Jóhann Jóhannsson. This heartfelt, authentic and conversational indie which is set somewhere in America during a winter and where a man whom is about to make a crucial decision regarding his own life which will also affect the lives of others is struck down to earth by a person who alters his life forever, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, subtle character development and continuity, pivotal instrumental tones, humane aura and the genuinely good acting performances by American actors Paul Dano, Jon Heder and child actress Shaylene Lynn Madigo in her debut feature film role. A silent, minimalistic and incisive cinematic letter from a filmmaker who through an efficiently understated style of filmmaking reaches the essence of her characters. A study in closeups where nothing happens; Caught this while flipping through premium channels one afternoon. Dano usually plays the same character, so I was anxious to see if he'd do something different here. He doesn't. I missed about the first 20 minutes of the film, so no idea if anything happened then, but I can assure you nothing happens after. I got rather frustrated waiting for something of interest. In the toy store scene with the little girl, you'll see one of the most painfully slow scenes in the history of cinema. I guess it was rather realistic, but realism can be painful. Dano's character in 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a younger version of his character in this film, but much more volatile and interesting to watch. Perhaps this is a 'thinking man's' movie and I'm just not smart enough for it. I will say that some of the cinematography, particularly with wide shots, was quite well done at least. Paul Dano -istic; Joby Taylor (Paul Dano) is a failed musician who just got divorced. He is estranged from his ex and his daughter. Essentially he is a complete mess. He needs to work out custody of his girl Ellen (Shaylena Mandigo) and in the process hopefully reconnect with her. Paul Dano is able to play this part well. However I think it took too long to get to the girl. It felt repetitive to see him as a loser for that long. It stagnated the film. For the film to work, it needs to get to the girl quicker. I hate to complain about a little girl's performance. But she added very little to the emotional feel. She is stone-faced thru most of her screen time. Although it could be argued that it is called for, it's hard to act back and forth without 1 side participating. Rather static and arid, but above average thanks to Dano's performance; Paul Dano is one of my favorite younger character actors and I have decided to watch all movies with his presence - luckily, it is not impossible as he is selective in taking roles... I like his versatility as well as courage to accept roles not arousing compassion or expanding fame. Joby Taylor is a de facto loser with personal and self-assertion issues without any ideas how to solve the status quo, thus, the pace is slow (often protracted) and events depicted are trivial, amplified by gloomy winter weather and interiors. Dano is constantly on screen, often alone, so the script is more suitable for a stage. Topics like children custody and personal coping are touchy, but it is still not enough for even an independent movie. As for the ending, I got ambivalent feelings as well. To sum up, not bad ideas and splendid starring, but too bleary and daily grind.   \n",

    Good!; Although she has been through a slump, it is good to see Barbie is getting her career back on track in another adventure. She is much improved and the kids really enjoyed the latest movie Barbie the pearl princess. The one drawback the movie is slow paced, lacking in tension and intrigue, and I am scratching my head wondering why the script has been written in this plodding manner. Of course a very obvious way to build up tension is to have a threat of imminent danger hanging over the protagonist's head. But for some reason this did not happen. Barbie sailed through the movie, cut peoples hair, explored the castle, made new friends, and for some reason the \"aunt\" had the threat of danger, as she had to poison the king along with the risk of getting caught. Why this lopsided approach? It did not work. Barbie was in some danger but it did not come across very well. The aunt stole the show in this respect. We all know \"The hero's journey\" And there is nothing worse than a movie in which the hero wants to go on the adventure/quest. The reverse should be; every step must be forced, conflicting emotions, divided loyalties, danger/risk of undertaking the quest versus the big payoff. When Barbie wanted to go to the castle, and did so, this was a major turn off and really hurt the movie. All in all a good offering, probably the best for quite some time.   \n",

       "      <td>Unbelievable piece of misogyny plus techy unknowledge.; The lack of techy care in the movie is noted well in other reviews. No plot details here, as many other users give that. Just to clear up something elsewhere noted...easy to miss, as it's one line in a single conversation. The reason no one at Angela's office recognizes her and she doesn't go to the Chronicle building to use the computer is: she has never been to SF or her office. She works out of her home in Venice Beach (near L.A.), making her a telecommuter before that was common, and incidentally pointing how very very good at \"legit hacker work\" she is supposed to be, that the company allows this. My comment concerns Sandra Bullock's character itself. Angela is supposed to be a supremely competent computer nerd on the level of a hacker, who is pretty much out of it socially. It makes sense that she is such a moron in regards to the men in the movie. But it's asinine that this extremely knowledgeable and competent woman would fly around squeaking \"help me help me!\" like a subnormally intelligent barefoot and pregnant little woman, taking actions like pressing every button on a radio three times fast and randomly while squeaking \"help me! help me!\" into the mic after the first murder attempt, make not the slightest attempt to protect herself (or anyone else) from the myriad and one things computers control which she obviously knew all about before any of this started, never be at all wary of anyone or anything until the movie is almost over...in short, she acts like the housewifey computer illiterate unable to even figure out the remote for the TV type awash in a sea of confusion throughout the movie, and the few moments of her sitting at some desk somewhere using some computer as if she knows all about it as well as the other character's comments about her switching servers and covering her tracks all ring utterly false because of it. This broad so clearly could not figure out how to hit the power button by herself, there is no way she would be able to handle a comp, much less do any of the things she supposedly does. That ruins an otherwise fun, if not technologically accurate, movie. Let's hope next time around Bullock's part isn't destroyed by a writer who believes that any woman who is good in a \"males only\" job must be shown up as really being the \"typical\" hysterical idiot female. (Anyone remember the can't be explained away by saying its supposed to be a comedy equally totally asinine incompetent female character Bullock portrayed in \"MS Congenialty\"?) Good Suspense;  Bullock Tolerable For Once; This is a typical Sandra Bullock movie in which she plays a mousy (but profane) woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero. Sound familiar? There are plenty of holes in this story. Things just don't add up and some of the suspense is a little corny. But - that suspense is very good. There is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it. The story starts off slow but kicks in pretty soon and stays that way, making it an involving movie for the viewer. That's why I give it a pretty good rating - the movie gets you involved in it. Bullock is more cute than annoying, which she normally is to me, so this is my highest-rated movie with her in it. Love this film; I never tire of watching this movie. I love it every time I watch it, which is often. Of course Sandra Bullock was made for this role. Dennis Miller does a fine job also. I am not very computer savvy, but I had no trouble following the parts of the movie to do with technology. With all the hacking of store accounts now, the plot is even more timely than when it was produced. it is also fun to make note of advances in technology - no more floppy disks. It is a cautionary tale for us all to watch our passwords and the information we let out. It can be enjoyed as a commentary of the times or as a fun movie to watch. No it is not one of the all time great movies,but it is timely and good entertainment. Pure entertainment; I enjoyed this film when I first saw it back in 1995, long before I  became Net savvy.  Let's face it: this film came out before ANYBODY was really that Net savvy.   Now, years later, the technology is unrealistic.  But if you see it as an interesting character, moving the plot along, rather than something to be dissected, it's a fun ride.  Think of it as that robot you saw way back when in Lost in Space--of course he was cardboard, but, boy, wasn't he cool?   I enjoyed Sandra Bullock in this role.  Pretty or not, I could imagine how lonely it could have been to be a women in technology in those days--visit any computer conference and you'll note that even now, we're a bit scarce.  And, I am a Mac Addict, so I'll willingly accept a movie world where Apple is the predominant technology.   I yearn for the innocent days of The Net.  The last time I went to see a so-called tech film, I was treated to John Travolta's character --in what was that, Swordfish?--utilizing it to sexually dehumanize women and murder dozens of people.  I will take Sandra Bullock saving the world with a floppy disk at MacWorld any day. Great movie, timely plot, pertinent points, and excellent portrayals.; I loved this movie! Movies and plays fulfill their purpose when they expose social, political, and other problems that affect the majority. This movie served that purpose. I identify with the plot and know people to whom this has happened. At the time this movie was made, concepts presented in this flick were advanced for the public, yet had already happened to friends of mine by way of people in powerful positions. And, I know what it is like when people do to you what they did to Angela Bennett, because they have done it to me. I greatly enjoyed Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Angela Bennett/Ruth Marx. She portrays a pretty, intelligent, and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid giving up to overwhelming odds, fight hard to keep her sanity and restore her life, and try to protect those whom she loves. Losing her self-concept and succumbing to that age-old attempt to bolster a sagging self esteem by indulging in sex with a stranger added a poignant touch of reality. The climax of the plot reveals the only real solution to this kind problem. Enjoyable but disposable; Sandra Bullock stars in a film which felt like it could have been much better. The premise, a trojan horse \"security\" product allowing the villains to alter data held on computers around the world and gain control through computer manipulation was interesting and the action set pieces successful, but the film was insufficiently engaging to make one really care about the outcome. Oh.  Gee.  Another Chase movie; Other then updating for the information age, The Net isn't particularly different than any other \"One person on the run by a vast global conspiracy - nobody believes her.\"  The biggest suspension of disbelief is that Sandra Bullock's character is a computer nerd, and that drags down what little  \"realism\" the pic may have.  Other than that, it's by-the-numbers chases, escapes, betrayals, and friends dying. What computers?; This movie is such a piece of unbelievable crap. First let me talk about the pros: Sandra Bullock in a black bathing suit. Now the rest of the story which is all pretty much bad. We have said computer programmer Angela Bennett (who's online profile is ANGEL - HOW WITTY!!! I bet the directors cheered over that one for an hour) who basically checks other Company's software for errors/glitches etc. So we start with her ordering pizza on the Internet and then putting on a fireplace on her monitor (EXTREME computer skills shown thus far). This is after she finds some virus on a macintosh program which crashes the whole system after hitting the escape key. This is apparently a HUGE problem yet the virus created to do such could be done in about 1 minute with a simple batch file. Any event, we move on. She gets this call from some other bloke (that works at the same company) and this fool says to go click this symbol which apparently opens up some secret Internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected 'top secret' data woohoo! Angela saves this crap on a disc and now the people that created this loophole are out to get her. This of course is only after she hooks up with one of the bad guys only BEFORE he tries to kill her BEFORE she jumps in the ocean off his boat, BEFORE she winds up in a random hospital. Problem #1: You can't create a loophole on the Internet to gain access to a bunch of top secret FBI data. Where the hell did this come from? Since when can a group of hackers control the basic flow of the Internet (even in 95)? Problem #2: Angela would need proper identification before a hospital or clinic would release her. She could not just pack her things and go. Then these 'hackers' or whatever change Angela's ID so she can't get help from anyone and conveniently enough all her ID is gone. So she returns home and a cat and mouse chase goes on and on and on. Apparently all police and FBI people are stupid and don't believe her. So then she has to utilize a bunch of tactics to enter into the building where she works (where the person who is now filling in for her is) and get back to her old computer. She starts talking to some other random bloke and finds out who is behind everything through some BS IP address that the director knows the audience is too stupid enough to believe. Then she runs to some center to mail all this information to the FBI. She apparently HAS to use a mainframe to email stuff to the FBI. But then the same fool that tried to kill her BEFORE throwing her in the water catches her and easily hacks into the FBI again (wtf?). But remember that cool virus? Well somehow she luckily gets that and even though the virus only worked on software, it now works on the entire system too. It brings down the whole mainframe which has all the fake information because the mainframe was just sitting in the middle of some convention... WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP! Anyway, the now uber virus works and Angela (the real one now) runs away and later kills the evil dude with a fire extinguisher. He of course has a gun, runs up to her so he's like 2 feet away and then decides to aim. CLASSIC Hollywood. All in all this movie is so full of BS and crap. Anyone who doesn't know a lot about computers will be wildly fooled into thinking this crap is possible but not one thing is accurate concerning computers or the net. And I honestly doubt I'd see a multiplatform virus for Mac and a mainframe computer (*cough LMAO*). The Net when it started; When this movie firt came out in 1995, I found it amazingly great. Especially with Sandra Bullock.After having watched her brilliant performance in Speed , i was ready to enjoy any of her movies. Back to The Net, it was a movie that keeps you in suspence.All in all, i enjoyed it so I give it a  **** out of *****. PLEASE!!! THERE IS NO DISCUSSION! THE NET IS A GREAT MOVIE!!!; I don't know who gave this movie a half of a star, but I am a huge fan of Sandra Bullock, and all of her work.  I am totally obsessed with this movie, not only because it is Sandra Bullock, but because it was so well written, and because it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time you watch it!  GREAT MOVIE! Please see it! You will love it! The action is great, and it is so neat to see how everything fits together in the end! Excellent A+! Her driver's license. Her credit cards. Her bank accounts. Her identity. DELETED.; The net is an excellent movie! It's about Angela Bennett(in a great performance of Sandra Bullock) who is a computer expert who works for the Cathedral Company, cleaning virus and testing games for the clients. Angela is a typical nerd who doesn't have friends outside of the cyberspace,almost doesn't take vacations and go out, and stays almost all the time connected. One day her friend Dale Hessman(Ray McKinnon) asks her to help him,sending Angela a disk with a strange program that has many confidential informations. At the same night, when Dale was going to meet her, he is suddenly killed in a plane crash.Going to Mexico in her vacation,Angela meets a beautiful guy called Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam)who shows to be a cold blood killer bastard and one of the guys behind all the secret of the Diskette. Her life then turns into a nightmare: All her records are erased and she is given the new identity of Ruth Marx, a woman with serious problems with the police. This movie is great because it shows how we, humans,depend a lot of the computers and machines(sometimes more that we should) and how vulnerable we are if someday ,someone decides to control and change our personal records,without letting us the chance to prove the error. Very good thriller; I'm quite a fan of thriller movies, and remembered seeing this movie before it came on TV one night. I hardly remembered any of it, but watched it anyway. Boy, I was in for a lot. Sandra Bullock is great in this, we feel her loneliness, and get to like her as the film moves on. Angela Bennet is a woman who basically fixes computer viruses for a job. She is sent a top secret disc, that has massive power in the wrong hands. As she goes on holiday, it is stolen by a man, who is using it's power to access \"The Net\" to delete Angela's identity. Angela returns home, signing under the name of \"Ruth MArx\" so she can access the USA. But her house has been sold, no one remembers her, her car isn't there, and she has no one to state that she is Angela Bennet. She now has to stay away from the police, who think she is the outlaw Ruth MArx, AND uncover the Conspiracy behind the Disc, the man that stole it and a huge Software company. There are lots of suspense scenes when you'll be shouting \"GET OUT THE ROOM!\" at the camera, and lots of action as well. I really cant see why this got a bad review, the only bad point is that the computers in this movie age it quite a bit, and that the plot/conspiracy is a tiny bit hard to understand. But you'll have fun watching this. A technically acurate thriller; Out of the recent genre of \"Big Brother\" computer plots this one has to be the most believable. No fancy whiz-kid hackers that break into FBI mainframe files in seconds. Irwin Winklers ability to bring reality into a thriller gives it the credibility that says \"This could happen - this could be me!\" Full marks for a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat based just on good scriptwriting and acting alone! If you like this one, \"Enemy of the State\" is worth looking at as well. Unwatchable; Are you kidding me? This movie is terrible. The plot twists can be seen a mile away by a blind man. There are big enough holes in the plot that a semi could be driven through them. Sandra Bullock is a charming actress, but the question is why would she make this movie? Dumb question, the answer of course is for a truck load of money. The script resorts to every cliche ever used in a thriller. From unnecessary chases that move the story along not at all to authorities that don't believe a word the victim says, we have seen this all before. And quite frankly, we have seen it done a hell of a lot better than it was done here. I can't even watch this movie because it is so methodical in letting you know what is going to happen next. It is just irritating. Unrealistic but still good; There is no doubt that Sandra Bullock can act, she also has a great deal of stage presence, she showed great chemistry with Dennis Miller and I'm gonna be bold enough to say that Sandra Bullock made this movie what it is. However, I had a problem with the unrealistic way the movie portrayed the Net. All those graphics (like the \"Mozart's Ghost\" one) were able to be saved on a floppy disk (when in reality, you need a zip drive to fit a file like that) and the Net wouldn't be able to handle that much graphic without Java or any other applet. When computers are concerned, it wasn't very realistic, and don't even get me started on that virus! But I gotta admit, I enjoyed watching this tech movie. Although for people who have no idea how the Net goes, this kind of movie will awaken feelings of paranoia and the notion that the Net is a horrible place. But I like this movie. I have always loved chase movies, but this isn't the typical chase movie, I don't know, I think it's the use of technology that makes it special. I give it a well-deserved **** I recommend it to anyone. We Ante In Microchips Now; For anyone who has ever logged on to the internet (and of course you have!) this movie will have you looking over your shoulder and seeking enrollment in a twelve step program for computer addiction.  `The Net,' directed by Irwin Winkler, stars Sandra Bullock as a computer nerd who has her identity-- her whole life, in fact-- snatched away from her with the stroke of a single key.  Angela Bennett (Bullock) is a computer whiz kid who works out of her home finding flaws in and debugging new programs sent to her on disc by her employer.  One day she inadvertently stumbles across one that is so big it sets off a chain reaction of intrigue that places her at the eye of the storm, though she hasn't a clue as to what it's all about.  All she knows is that suddenly she's not herself any more; at least according the records stored on hard drives everywhere.  And it's only the beginning of complications, the likes of which would give anyone with even the slightest bit of paranoia nightmares. \\tWith a plot that would make Kafka proud, this precursor to the even more paranoia-inducing `Enemy Of The State,' is a dark, cautionary tale of the misuse of a  technology that has quickly encompassed virtually every walk of life, yet without anyone having first harnessed the full fury of it's potential.  A work of fiction?  Of course; one could even say `science' fiction.  But in this case the technology is already in place, and anyone who wants YOU badly enough need look no further than the data base of the DMV, a credit card bureau or the Post Office, and they will quickly know more about you than you know yourself.  For those who would scoff, there's an old adage that goes something like:  Anything that can be used `for' you can also be used `against' you.  At the very least it's food for thought that could keep those with opposing views on the matter debating endlessly.  Or, as in this case of this movie, it's enough to drive the average computer hacker to the brink of madness.  Shades of Lovecraft. \\tAt any rate, Winkler has given us an engrossing film that is intense and so exasperating, as you can only sit by and watch helplessly as he puts Angela through her paces, while Bullock makes it all convincing with an excellent performance, making Angela believable as an average girl-next-door whose frame of reference doesn't go much beyond her computer screen.  And all without making her too innocent or naive; she strikes an honest chord with her character that makes her one with whom the audience can readily identify, which is one of the strengths of the movie.  She evokes such empathy that it's easy to feel what it would be like to be in her place; and through her eyes, it's not a pretty sight.   \\tThe supporting cast includes Jeremy Northam (Jack), Dennis Miller (Alan), Diane Baker (Mrs. Bennett), Wendy Gazelle (Ruth Marx) and Ken Howard (Bergstrom). Along with the dawning of a new age in technology comes the birth of a new era in fiction that will forevermore be fueled by the microchip.  And if `The Net' is any indication, buckle your seat belts, because it's going to be an intense, bumpy-- and highly entertaining-- ride (as already evidenced by `The Matrix,' as well as the aforementioned `EOTS').  It's inevitable that the questions of possibility or probability will arise, especially when a film like this has a contemporary setting; but the most important thing to remember is that if projects such as this fall into capable hands, we'll all be in for some exciting cinema.  It's all a matter of using the magic wisely.  I rate this one 6/10. Mediocre Internet crime thriller; Mediocre Internet crime thriller which starts OK, but then lacks development and turns pretty much into Sandra Bullock being chased around by lots of nasty but clever people who also delete/steal her passport, credit cards, work, insurance records and everything else. The \"reason\" for all mayhem is fairly lame  and to me some of these events appeared to occur in the wrong logical order. Also, all the impossible computer hacks were cloaked by use of buzzwords/fancy graphics to make it sound and look like they knew what they were doing. I preferred Disclosure. Suspenseful but with a human story; \"The Net\" is a fantastic film. Sandra Bullock is funny, refreshing, and tragic by turns, as a \"nobody\" caught in the middle of a major conspiracy to take over the Internet, and thereby, our very lives. Like many good films, \"The Net\" lets us see things from various points of view at once. When Angela is trying to explain her predicament to her court-appointed lawyer, we can see her paranoia as both understandable from her point of view and as the typical defensive craziness that her public defender might see. Jeremy Northam is perfect as the bad guy who can't seem to decide whether he wants to prolong the sexual tension of the chase or just kill her and get it over with. As one other reviewer here has noted, this film is very Hitchcockian. It reminded me of \"Strangers on a Train\": the carousel scene seems to be a direct reference to \"Train,\" and the whole theme of Angela meeting a stranger who then takes over her life is very similar. The film is very skillfully edited for suspense. For example, the scene on the boat when Angela discovers the gun: she is shown just discovering it right before Devlin comes up to the deck, but by the time he gets there, she's quite prepared for his arrival, although you think she's a goner. This sort of editing is masterful and really adds to the suspense. The scene where she confronts Devlin on the boat is my favorite: I just love how she says \"So.... who are you...Jack?\" -- she gives the word \"Jack\" just the right staccato emphasis. Devlin's response is classic, and gives away his \"badness\" perfectly; and then the camera focusing on only half his face at a time (eyes/mouth) is perfect, also. This recalls the camera's focus on Angela's mouth when she's typing to the chat room before. The implication is that we are just mouths on the Internet (typing words) and eyes in real life (sexual attraction), and we have to connect the two somehow. I also liked the use of names: \"Champion\" for Angela's only friend, \"Devlin\" for the devilishly evil Jack, \"Angela\" (often shortened to \"Angel\") to denote Angela's essential innocence. Angela's mother having Alzheimer's reinforces Angela being cut off from people -- the person she's closest to doesn't even remember her name. I always get teary during the scene where she's trying to get her mom to identify her to the cop (although Angela calling her may be putting her mom in danger, it's a very human thing for her to do). Over the course of the movie, we see Angela changing: she's starting to value her friends and family more, and realizing that she's been cut off from people. Ironically, Devlin is one of the instruments of her growing understanding, when he tells her that \"we're really very similar, you and I.\" She's shocked into realizing that she *is* tied to her family (such as it is) with a bond of love (even her defense of her absentee father to Champion brings us some insight into her feeling for her family). This attachment to people is something neither Devlin nor the \"imposter Angela\" can understand (for example, the \"imposter Angela\" looks around at the computer convention and says: \"Let's get outta here, all these people are making me nervous\"). Annie Lennox's cover of \"Whiter Shade of Pale\" is used in the film, most appropriately. Angela is a \"vestal virgin\" in many ways, who must go through some pretty psychedelic experiences to find herself. An important aspect of this film is obviously its portrayal of a brief moment in history when only a few organizations and hackers were aware of the vast potential of the Internet. Because this film was made in 1995, it conveys the feeling of \"newness\" of all the technology. This makes Angela's isolation from others both easier to understand (weren't all hackers at that time isolated from those who had no idea what the \"Internet\" was?) and more frightening: will we all soon succumb to the Net's seductive pull? The computer aspects of the film were actually quite impressive: if not totally realistic for the technology of the time, at least the film has aged well. For the time it was made, the film's understanding of the role the Internet would play in our lives was almost prophetic. The main point about the use of the technology in the film, however, is that it does *not* override the human story. Overall, I recommend this film as highly entertaining and suspenseful, with the theme of the dangerous implications, for both the individual and society, of our new computer technology. Not one fact correct; Got a peak of this movie for the second time a week ago and I just had to react to the incredible amount of errors in the movie. OK, so the Internet was quite new in the days when the movie was made, but that doesn't mean they have to make it wrong. The movie can't beat the \"virus-uploading-scene\" in ID4, but it's not far from. I don't wanna spam this comment with all errors made, I just wanna point out that if you like movies that make sense don't see this one. If it wasn't for Sandra Bullock I would never had seen the full movie. Net of mistakes; Rating: *1/2 out of **** \"The Net\" is one of those films that won't remain in your mind till the next one hour. Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is. It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage. One of those adjectives I've just used above is the reason which made me add 1/2 a star to the one I would have given. So is it a case of 'so bad it is good'? No. It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'. Bullock in a (surprise!) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time. She works at home, doesn't have any friends and her neighbors don't know her. Suddenly, she sees herself involved in dangerous situations, after her colleague dies and the same thing almost happens to her. Her identity, bank accounts, etc, etc, etc, are all deleted, and she is now Ruth Marx. The conspiracy involves even the government and... Wait! Haven't we seen this before? Yes, thousands of times. \"The Net\" tries to be modern, to be the portrait of the '90s, showing the computer as a villain. Big deal! It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes. Take the scene of the boat accident. I just laughed when the camera started to get slow... What makes everything even worse here is Sandra Bullock. How awful she is! Has she already made a decent film? \"A Time to Kill\", okay. But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures. The vantages and disadvantages of the computer were already shown in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", the best, most intelligent and most complex film ever made. It's not needed to compare \"The Net\" with it, is it...? The only reason to see \"The Net\" is to laugh, as I've said, and to see what it tried to be. The results, well, are a shame. DELETE this film from your mind! It's not rocket science but...; You could get into the nitty gritty of this film, and say how it couldn't happen, or how could the main character just walk into offices and start using computers etc without someone noticing and really pick the movie to bits...or you could just sit back with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the acting. Personally, I prefer the latter, I live real life and watch the news with all it's doom and gloom, and so would much rather be entertained by my movies, and see the bad guys get their just rewards.  Don't take it too seriously, and you can thoroughly enjoy this film. Sandra's ok to me!; I really like Sandra Bullock in all acting, but the net was the best! I don't care if the virus screens were a little fake, I liked it and bought it! I have seen it 10 times and are ready for more. Regards, RT woman is pursued by killers who want her floppy; Sandra Bullock portrays a computer nerd who comes into possession of a valuable floppy. A mysterious group want the software, and are willing to kill her for it. They move on her as she is on vacation, wiping her identity out making it impossible to return home. An exciting chase ensues with a thrill a minute. One of Sandra's best. Interesting movie; I saw this movie on TV. It was one of those movies that really make you think. It was thrilling and fun to watch. Great entertainment! I give it an 8 out of 10. Underdone Internet Thriller; A fantastic premise that bears no fruit. I am sure there's a great espionage thriller in the Internet somewhere, but this half-baked idea from co-writer/director Irwin Winkler is dreadfully underdone. \"The Net\" is seriously lacking in character development, so we never get a chance to delve into the minds of the players involved in this story of a computer freak who accidentally stumbles across a program which allows access to restricted sub-nets like the air traffic control network, and several other highly sensitive computer systems. Before poor Angela Bennet knows what's happening, she's fleeing for her life and trying to convince someone of the existence of the evil organisation that is infiltrating the Internet. The half-decent plot turns out very pedestrian in the hands of Winkler. Admittedly there wasn't a great deal he could do with this neglected yarn, but he appears to have gambled on the chance that the clever premise would alone be enough to carry the entire show. Not so! \"The Net\" is an enjoyable entertainment though, thanks to Sandra Bullock's natural every-girl appeal - she may not have the face of a model, and she's no Jodie Foster, but somehow Sandra manages to keep you interested in what's happening to her. Bullock not only carries the limping storyline, but the 'along for the ride' support cast as well. Mark Isham's score is catchy, but not utilised nearly enough. Good fun, but \"Disclosure\" it is not. Looking forward to a real Internet nail biter! Tuesday, November 7, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema A decent if (dated) thriller -which only makes it more fun; I caught this on TV the other night and stuck with it. Its seriously dated now (1995) and laughable in terms of computer technology and giant cell phones but still a good thriller for the most part. Actually all the outdated technology just ended up making this kind of fun and campy. I think its the hook of Sandra's entire identity being erased and replaced with that of a wanted criminal that's so good -scary and intriguing there. The bad guy (Jeremy Northam) becomes very one dimensional after his initial charm wears off but Sandra Bullock does a great job all the way through, with lots of running and evading of the cyber thugs. This opens with Angela Bennett, a reclusive computer programmer who works from home, orders pizza online and only associates with her cyber friends. After she unwittingly comes into possession of software that allows access to secret government information Angela's life is put in danger as the bad guys try to gain access to the floppy disk, culminating with them deleting all evidence of her existence. Dennis Miller plays her sort of boyfriend here and there is a brief cameo from Ron Howard. I always forget how AIDS paranoid we were in the early 90's. 4/11/15 I enjoyed it; I thought this was an exciting thriller. Sandra does a wonderful job in her role. The most interesting thing about it is, that this could easily happen. That is what makes this whole movie so scary. You never know whom you will meet, in real life or on the internet. Our lives are on the computer. All of our information is on the computer. We sometimes can never know who to trust. This movie was very well paced. It started kind of slow, but it helped show us who Angela Bennett was. I know there are people out there who would love to have Angela Bennett's job, and not have to deal with the outside world. All in all, an enjoyable movie. One I can watch over and over. Sandra Bullock and dial up modems!; Think back to 1995, did you even know what I.D. theft was? Well Michael Ferris and John Brancato did, and at the time, it wasn't really that scary. In the film, Sandra Bullock lives alone, spending most of her time fixing her company's computers online. She seems to rarely go out or socialize except with others by computer. She even orders her food over the computer, and it's delivered. Because she keeps to herself, hardly anyone knows her personally, and her mother is in a nursing home with Alzheimer's Disease, so she doesn't remember her. Her only friend is an ex boyfriend, who happens to be a psychiatrist, and she's broken up with him. The fact that she's so incognito has a lot to do with the film. Before leaving for her first vacation in years, she get's a call from a friend in her company who is confused about a weird disk that's come into his possession, and wants her to help him. Not willing to figure it out over the phone or on the computer, he tells her he needs to see her in person and he's flying to her home in L.A. He never arrives... The cast is great, with Sandra Bullock pulling out all the stops in her fight for what is right. There are no sex scenes, no violence or over-indulgent special effects, just content. Every movie lover should own a copy of this film as an example of how to make a film without over indulgence and heavy reliance on effect.. This is a film that can be viewed several times, with each time revealing a little more detail. There is less obvious comedy and glamour in this role, but Sandra Bullock is excellent and intense, as the woman fighting for her life, and ends on a happy note caring for her Mother, and with a new status, working from a new home. There were a lot of conspiracies in this movie, in my opinion its a film that makes you really think how controlled your life is by the internet. Very compelling story. Overall rating: 8 out of 10. Wonderful; When I first saw this movie, I was blown away at how realistic it was. Everything in this movie could really have happened and it gives us a different view on the Internet and the control someone could have in a position like the baddies have in this movie.  You genuinely feel for Sandra Bullock's character in this movie.  Great performances from all actors and thank you to the director for making such a brilliant movie. I like this movie very much!; Just a short comment! I want to say that I like this movie very much! Sandra Bullock is my favourite actress. I like the whole story, from the beginning until the end! I have it on tape and I can watch it a 100 times, it doesn't matter!!! If you are true to yourself, you needn't overcast.; The Net is a glass of onion martini. I have no doubt that Sandra Bullock falls for the taste. Though too many efforts have been made to foreshadow the climax that comes too late, the movie is still thrilling especially in the cat-and-mouse chasing scenarios and near the end of the story. Bullock's performance has great weight with the box office. That's what we call Bullock influence, bigger than the film itself. She is low-key and she never overdraws her roles. Maybe that's because she is acting herself. If you are true to yourself, you needn't overcast. This is much a self-independent, self-help story, a predecessor of \"Flight Plan\". These women are really heart breakers because of their braveness in desperation. Helpless, desperate, fragile yet stubborn, they want to survive this jungle-law world. If Weaker or less intelligent, they will be devoured mercilessly. There are heaps of \"innocent people being wrongly accused\" movies. Maybe it reflects our tastes. The movie is well-crafted. It covers the affection a daughter has for her mother who's caught senile dementia; deals with tenderness a psychologist shows to his former patient and lover; as well as admiration and hatred an assassin entertains to his target. They were tangled up to make the movie a little bit overloaded. Jeremy Northam is blessed with the role as the assassin who is more complex than we see those in other movies. Bullock's roles are stereotyped, mostly\" nobody turning to a big hero\". She is still likable. Harmless filler; OK, I didn't watch this film for accuracy nor was I expecting a true \"thriller\". I like Sandra Bullock a lot, and this was a film of hers I hadn't seen before, so I rented it. While You Were Sleeping is so dear to my heart (my favorite movie), but I wanted to see Sandra in something a little different. This slick movie was quite a departure for her. Not only for Bullock, but for Jeremy Northam, who was amazing as Mr. Knightley in Emma. But his villain is too cartoonish to really be believable, but that might be the writers' fault and not his. Anyway, The Net is fun, but to me it got pretty boring and tedious towards the end. Nothing great, but OK. not too realistic, but what it portrays should be a cause for concern; When \"The Net\" was first being advertised, the ads made it look ridiculous. Then, when I saw it, it was actually quite good. Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) spends her days working on the computer and has never gotten to know her neighbors. Then, through a series of events, her identity gets erased by a cabal of shadowy people, and she can't prove that she exists. Some parts of the movie are a little bit far-fetched; you'd probably know which parts if you saw the movie. Still, it's a good look into what the existence of the Internet may have wrought on unsuspecting people. I do recommend it. Beauty (black bikini) and beast (absurd computers); Why a rating of 5? Because 10 stars go to to Sandra's black bikini... To be more precise, to Sandra's wonderful body and her amazing face shot in close up. 0 stars go to everything else, especially the way they present software. I suppose that the at the time Apple managers sponsored the film, just to destroy their own brand: A computer network that's so easy to hack and that lies about everything was not the best way to promote Apple... Thanks God Steve Jobs returned back and stopped immediately those ultra expensive, self destroying ad campaigns. If you love Sandra Bullock, watch this movie, it's worth it. Otherwise forget it. I like just about any movie with Sandra Bullock; This could be a spoiler, I have to say that I only thought 5 of the scenes were hokey and not of them had to do with computers. Whoever did the technical review and technical advising of the script was not very thorough. The boat scene was dumb, I drove one of those when I was 6 years old um I am sure Sandra even though she plays a blonde sometime with all that computer experience would have been smart enough to figure out how to operate that boat. And the IP address and the search for the IP address through the routers was technically incorrect along with the who is search through a router. IP addresses in the 300 range are incorrect. The search wouldn't have gotten past the first 300 number it would have said subnet range is incorrect when you tried to type it the first time. So they didn't want people going out searching/hacking that IP address use an address 10.15.224.30 at that point you could have shown that address a million times and no one is hacking anything. It wont route. And then there is the scene where Dennis Miller is intubated but hey hes quiet that way! ty but no gr8 thrillr! Not 2 bad tho @s far as xciting 'net movies go.; For once I totally agree with the voted rating here. 5.6 is spot on! Sandra B plays a computer whiz, altogether one sexy package, who offers a customised programming and data manipulation service to her clientele. What a shock then when we find she has taken one job too many...or rather the WRONG job. Before you can say \"Norton's Utilities\" she finds herself pretty much electronically \"erased\" and on the run from the law, her boyfriend (ultimately poor choice here!) and a really bad holiday! Although cliche'd and not much in the suspense or logic department, Bullock keeps the thing moving along - she is by far the best thing in it! Predictable and hammy ending don't exactly spoil it, because there never was anything much to spoil. A few decent keyboards on display, but little else. Jeremy Northam turns in an over the top performance as Sandra Bullock's lover-come-lately and the film's conclusion reeks of cinematic desperation. Not suited to multiple viewings unless one is very easily pleased! Intriguing!; I liked this movie very, very much. And it shows what happens when you become a victim of ID theft. You know who you are, but everyone doesn't. Angela Bennet(Sandra Bullock), is a big time computer geek who spends time on computers and pizza. Really doesn't give much anything else, until now. Sandra Bullock really puts on a show playing the strong will, smart and cunning character. Not only was Angela was the victim, other around and outside her were as well. Though she encountered some phonies along the way. Ruth Marx(Wendy Gazelle) really had everyone fooled except the real Bennet and me. If it wasn't for the infected disk, the fraudulent happening would have continued to spread like a plague. So far, the movie wasn't boring, it was filled intrigue, suspense, and most of all a fine ending. Everyone got what they wanted and so did I. Well done, Sandra Bullock! Rating 3 out of 5 stars! This Net Not Worth Getting Caught In.; The Net (1995): Dir: Irvin Winkler / Cast: Sandra Bullock, Jeremy Northam, Dennis Miller, Diane Baker, Ken Howard: Intriguing yet disappointing thriller about the Internet snare Sandra Bullock finds herself caught in. She gains access to a disc and encounters a peculiar guy while on vacation who seeks the disc. She makes her escape only to discover that she suddenly doesn't exist. She does a lot of running from danger to find out who is using her name and what the content on the disc is. Director Irvin Winkler does an effective job at creating Bullock's sudden world of paranoia. Bullock basically runs and makes narrow escapes. She could have out paced most marathon runners with the amount of running she does, and it effects the depth of the role, which slowly disintegrates. Jeremy Northam is cardboard as the sly villain. He talks the talk and gets blasted in the face with a fire extinguisher. He should be thankful considering how dull his dialogue was sounding coming from his mouth. Dennis Miller plays Bullock's only trusted friend who lands in trouble just for helping her. Or perhaps he landed in hot water for agreeing to do the film. Diane Baker also appears for all the good it does her. It is well made but it is unfortunate that the screenplay settles for tired thriller formula as oppose to examine the reality of identity theft. It teaches how easy one's identity can disappear as easy as the screenplay. Score: 4 / 10 mildly entertaining....; note:  some spoilers may be contained. the basic premise of this movie is that sandy bullock comes across some information she is not supposed to have, and spends two hours running from the bad guys. course, ole sandy has her demons...father ran off, mother suffering from memory loss...and pretty much keeps to herself.  so that bad guys (who have the power to break in to all these computers) just steal her identity. i read a comment that this was not a chick flick, but it VERY MUCH is.  the most all common element that draws it in are that all of the males in the film are either the bad guys OR are of no real help to the protagonist.  in my opinion, dennis miller has a pretty good role as her former lover/therapist who is the only person who can identify her, but he quickly gets offed. while it was mildly entertaining, the movie somewhat drug on and was just too predictable. Real TERROR of modern life.; Imagine, you put your informations in the internet and your life is ruined by the internet. Real TERROR of modern life. I love this movie very much because it presented us the fact that Internet has a dark side too. Our life turn up-side down by internet can happen in our real life.  Everything in this movie can be real. I think that this movie tried to warn The Internet Users all over the world to be careful about using Internet or else you will be like Sandra Bullock in this movie.  Her life (in this movie) is totally up-side down. Silly suspense; Made and released at the time when the internet was just becoming huge, this is a storyline Hitchcock would have loved. Sadly, Hitchcock wasn't around to make it, and we're left with an occasionally suspenseful but mostly silly thriller, that is held (barely) together by Bullock's intelligence. It was released in 1995 but is already dated, and the amount of mistakes and inaccuaracies regarding computers must be seen to be believed, and you don't even have to be a dot.com person to spot them! The prototypical two-and-a-half star movie; This movie must have been what critics were thinking of when they invented the two-and-a-half star rating. The writing is average, the direction is average, the suspense is average, and the acting (besides Sandra Bullock) is average. Bullock has seen her share of flops (\"Two If by Sea\", \"Speed 2\", and most recently, \"Practical Magic\") but she still manages to give consistently good, if not Oscar-worthy, performances. Besides that, the movie is, well...average. Web thriller on it's edge!; Pursued by an IT based terrorist to totally annihilate Angela Bennet(Sandra Bullock)in the world, she finds no one to relay her ordeal coz no one would going to believe such a story w/o anticipating the reality that connects user from the danger's of giving up personal information on the computerized system. A breath stopping chased ensued between Angela and her would be assassin played by(Jeremy Northam)and the chances of recovering her true identity from the Ruth Marx he shifted into her was dimmer w/o taking the risk of infiltrating the same software program w/c brought her to mess. Then in the end , she outsmarted the thugs raising the fact that no evil schemes could succeed good ones. Albeit I was little puzzled of how they over demonstrated the capability of computers, I can still brag that it was still a great movie compared to the flop, garbage cyber film,\"Hackers\".Thrilling portrayal of the web world is how I summed up this movie. Caught Like a Fish in the Net; This film deals with identity theft. Made nearly a decade ago, you might think it is outdated and irrelevant. WRONG! The topic is more relevant today than when it was made. The writing is ingenious and the acting is superb. Sandra Bullock is arguably better than she was in The Lake House, or even The Blind Side. I think this is one of her best works. The supporting actors are also good, but less memorable. I made popcorn to eat while watching, but found myself too mesmerized to begin chewing. The suspense is terrifying. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film. I never knew what would happen next. After watching, I can only hope I never find myself in a situation like this. Hopefully this film will help people realize the real threat of identity theft and be aware on how to prevent it. Two thumbs way, way up. It is, by far, one of the most thought out films of the decade. I tie my arm to be free-have you ever been free?; Unlike a box of cereal, a movie does not have contents, instead a movie has scenes and sequences. When I emptied out the contents of this cereal box of a movie, I looked upon a spread-out mass of meaningless pieces, not worth consuming. They made the movie too soon, like the studio heard back in 95 that the Internet might be a thing in the future, so they cobble together a feeble film under the premise that being first is always best, first internet movie! yeah! Generic thriller ham-fistedly rendered, lacking at all times suspense. Featuring a PG-13 rating so you know for certain nothing awesome will happen, no blood no tittie no cussing no violence. All of our schemes and machinations just to have sex with each other--it's all a big joke. Does Hollywood just not care anymore?; This is my first review, so go easy on me. I have to say that this is one of my all time Favorites. I think I watched this the first time when I was about 13 and not so long ago got my own Computer with Internet Access. I know how People say that there are a lot of Plot holes in this Movie, but I have to say I just don't see them. I am usually very picky and even small stuff gets me to complain. This movie actually does a very good Job at making this kind of Identity Theft even possible Today. Just imagine being able to search through every Database and change everything about a Persons life? Even if People would know them, for the System they don't exist or appear to be someone else and therefore just adding Identy theft to the list. You can already put it on there to make it more believable. That being written I would recommend this Movie to anyone who is even just slightly interested into Technology. It has a good pace and it actually gets me to think a little bit, which is more then I can say about more recent Movies. Sandra Bullock gives a believable performance even though some scenes are really just set up for her to look scared and disoriented, but in that Situation you would be too. Decent, if somewhat far-fetched thriller; The films protagonist; software engineer Angela Bennett, works from home; in fact she is such a recluse that she has never met any of her co-workers in person and doesn't even know her neighbours; her only contacts are the people she talks to on the internet and her mother who has Alzheimer's. One day a co-worker sends her a strange program that gives access to a new security program known as Gatekeeper; she agrees to meet him but he is killed when his plane's navigation system fails. She is shocked but thinks it was an accident so goes on her planned holiday to Mexico. Here she meets Jack Devlin; he appears to be the perfect man for her to spend time with as he shares so many of her interests; the problem is he just wants the disc with the program on and is 'perfect' because he has been talking to her on line. When he thinks he has the disc he intends to kill her but she manages to escape. This isn't the end of her troubles though; somebody has changed all computer records relating to her; when she gets home she finds her home is up for sale and her employers now have a new 'Angela Bennett' working in their offices; she is left with the identity 'Ruth Marx'; a wanted criminal. With her identity stolen she turns to the only man she can trust; Alan Champion her former psychiatrist and one time lover. Devlin is still trying to kill her; if she is to survive she is going to have to find out about a sinister group of hackers known as the Praetorians and how they are connected with Gatekeeper. In many ways this film feels quite dated and in many ways it is obviously far-fetched; if you can overlook these faults though it is a decent paranoid thriller with plenty of tense moments. Sandra Bullock did a fine job as the protagonist although I found it a little hard to believe that somebody as socially awkward as Angela Bennett would have worn THAT bikini... it did look good on her though! The rest of the cast were good enough although none of the other characters were really fleshed out. If you can suspend belief enough to accept that it might be possible to completely steal some ones identity the film as a nice streak of paranoia running through it; how would a person behave if nobody believed who they said they were any more? Over all I'd say this is far from being a classic but it was much better than I expected and is worth watching if you want a reasonable thriller. Sandra rocks!; This awesome, action-packed little gem, is one of my all-time favorite movies!! Sandra Bullock, once again, outdoes herself in this wicked film all about the Internet and the taking-over of people's lives. In 'The Net', Bullock stars as Angela Bennett, a computer-whizz, who while on holiday, encounters a dangerous man, who steals her wallet... and her life. Soon, the real Angela Bennett disappears, and an ex-con, takes on her identity, swapping her life for Angelas! Of course, Sandy isn't the type to take this kinda thing lying down - and all on her own, she fights hard to get back the life they took away from her. A wicked film - that'll leave you breathless for start to finish!! 9/10 Unrealistic; I don't understand why a woman so capable with the Internet would send and receive viruses via fed-ex-ed floppy disks as opposed to online. Hello, one of the things about being online is that every bit of information can be transported electronically. Did anyone else find this ridiculous?

Not Bad; I have to admit, I was only attracted to this movie due to the appearance of Jeremy Northam. After seeing him in \"Emma,\" I knew he was one of the greats. I didn't think he'd do well alongside Sandra Bullock, but I was proved completely wrong! They were dynamic. This movie is enough to hold you in your seat and then rocket you out of it. I've seen it three times, and still bite my nails for the last half hour of the film. The movie's pretty clean, so I think it's probably okay for most kids to watch (only a few bad words, and one scene where it's pretty obvious Jack and Angela made love; but it's not graphic and there's no nudity). All in all, I think it's a pretty cool movie. If you believe a man can fly then believe this; OK yes, the tech is old but it's my era tech. I loved the 3 and a half inch discs, I even liked the 5 inch floppies before those, not keen on the tape though, and I loved Castle Wolfenstien, first game where I beat the last boss, anyway la di da great movie. I watched to the end (That's always a good sign). Although I would liked to see the main villain Gregg get more than prison, a bit of torment as he realized the game was up, beaten by female geek no less. Sandra Bullock always does a good job in any acting role so it's worth a watch just see her doing her stuff (A very attractive girl also)(Can I say that?) so, definitely worth a watch, recommend. Oh, Mellisa Bones, nice job. A regular and engaging action movie with a storyline full of holes.; This film tells how a young computer technician sees her life stolen by hackers, who want to install an advanced computer hacking program on the computers of banks and state enterprises. Soon, she turns into a target, sought by the police, and arranges a way to stop the villains. It's a rather unreal story, full of holes but nice, creating a suspense that can hold us until the end. The pace is good and the short length also helps, there is no plot for a very long film. I especially liked Jeremy Northam, who gives us the main villain, a dangerous assassin in charge of stealing a disc that went to the hands of Angela (Bullock's character), and that tries to do it approaching romantically of her before revealing its face and trying to kill her. Sandra Bullock also played well, but we have seen this actress in several other similar characters. The rest is within the standards of a regular action movie of the nineties, so there is nothing more to point out here. Awful; What a miserable movie about the wonderful Internet. Sandy Bullock is for a sure a doll; I usually like all her movies but this one I could take for about an hour and off it went. A ridiculously confusing and impossible-to-believe story which was supposed to be \"Hitchcockian\" while turning out to be dumber than a Three Stooges reel. Good movie at that time; The Net seems to be a good movie at a time when the internet technology just took its pace off. Thus, it would've left people ignorant and puzzled when they hear terms used in the movie. Good entertainer though! Sandra Bullock's acting in the movie is good. The screenplay is good except in a few places where it could've been done much better. A scene where the guy updates the criminal record of Ruth Marx is far from reality. It makes people think that it was so easy to make anyone a criminal just by hacking up a server of the police department. And things like mainframe, I think it was not shown properly. A mainframe usually depicts the scene of huge servers in a room or its a remote session in a mainframe terminal. But sandra looks like she has been using a web user interface though which could've confused many audience. Caught Up in Its Own Absurdity; Futile Question revealing gross stupidity: 'Shark-fishing with a silencer?'' Cliché-ridden and dated, this movie has little to offer in terms of suspense, and, despite Bullock's charm, fails to live up to the attraction of the premise behind it. One can imagine that the pitch of a freelance computer analyst unmasking a conspiracy to control information on the internet, then becoming herself a victim of identity threat as the criminal organisation attempts to silence her, held great promise for the studio chiefs. However, the finished product contains too many flaws to deliver. The first issue, beyond the director and producers' control, is that the constant evolution of information technology underlines the inherent risk of focusing a plot so closely upon it. As a consequence, the grainy graphics on display, and outdated formats like the dependence on floppy discs, can so readily lose immediacy for current audiences. Moreover, the film suffers as any would in terms of pace by having to focus on what is happening on a computer monitor. As such, the screenplay opts for the lazy option of having Bullick's supposed computer genius constantly read out what she types. Yet, other deep-rooted plot deficiencies are far more harmful to the film's overall success. The narrative thread throughout requires the audience to suspend disbelief at how our heroine's gullibility, and random coincidence, trigger one chase scene after another. In returning to the first point, one only has to reflect on the risible reactions of our supposed gifted analyst upon discovering that the object of her holiday romance is a professional hit-man sent to eliminate her. Worse follows, with her seconds-long flight ended crashing into rocks large enough to be seen from another celestial body. Yet, of all the implausible scenes within the movie, this reviewer would give pride of place to our beleaguered and detained heroine choosing to make her one available phone call to establish her true identity to her mother, who it has already been established suffers from Alzheimer's. From evidence present here, it appears that the same writing team of Brancato and Ferris' later success with 'The Game', a remarkably similar screenplay of a stranded individual battling against identity threat, must owe much to the skills of the director of that project, David Fincher. Sadly, in this instance, director Irwin Winkler, much more adept at producing than helming, shares the fortunes of his writers' more customary run of disastrous releases. Another negative aspect concerns both the implausible ineptitude of Jeremy Northam's professional killer, and his own leaden performance in that role. This performance is ham-fisted enough without being further lain open to ridicule by Winkler's choice of a close-up on his villain's demonic stare to establish the threat he poses - a technique more akin to silent movies, and better executed by them. Equally as bereft of either acting ability or believability is the presence of Dennis Miller as our protagonist's ex-shrink and ex- lover cum stalker, Dr Alan Champion. So unappealing is his character that his demise at the hands of the cyber-criminals arraigned against our heroine is welcomed rather than evoking a sense of tragic loss. Overall, though this feature attempts to construct a Hitchcockian style suspense, it never rises above the lowest made- for-TV movie production levels. So-so thriller, silly computer graphics; This movie turned out to be an OK thriller, at least for me.  It really moves slowly in places.  And, yes, the computer graphics are of the \"Only In Hollywood\" variety.  Macintosh users:  our fave computer is used a lot throughout the movie(again, excuse the geeky, gimmicky graphics).  Also, look for a couple Photoshop filters to make cameos! My number 166 movie; You have read correctly. This is my number 166 movie. Sandra Bullock does a good job in this thriller, and she looks good. This is a film that you like , when you watch it 2 or 3 times. But the more you watch, the worse it gets. So I recommend watching this not more than 3 times. I rated this film 8/10, because it is a good thriller. exciting!; This was a good thriller where Sandra Bullock plays a computer expert who vacations in Mexico. While there, the bad guys distract her, steal her purse and wallet, trick her into signing a false visa, and use them to delete her identity on the internet. Fortunately, she is a computer expert and able fight back, and what follows is an exciting and tense chase throughout the next two hours. I will admit that this is predictable (what thriller isn't?), but it does have its moments and is tense throughout. The scary thing is that it could happen to you! Bullock gives a terrific performance, and overall I think this was an outstanding movie. Anyone who likes thrillers will like this one. *** out of **** Very good.; Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses, and she does a very good job, as usual.  The Net is suspenseful all the way through, and you are literally rooting for Sandra to kick the bad guys' bootwah!  And kick some bootwah she does do!  It had me on the edge of my seat in the theaters, and I immediately bought it when it came out on video.  A very good movie. Wait. . .what's this thing at the bottom right corner of my screen. . .maybe I should click it. . .No!  Don't click the thingy at the bottom right corner of the. . .!  **** out of *****. There are worse films.. but not many!; When I started watching it I did not know I was going to witness one of the worst movie experiences of my life. The movie is made in 1995 so in some way it is excused. But still, it tries to be high tech in a time period when high tech did not exist! The movie is so far of when it comes to what was possible back then. This was at the birth of Java, Internet as we know it, USB etc. but still not one part of the movie is believable. How someone can rate this film up to 7 or 8 is beyond my comprehension. They were either drunk, asleep during the film, keen on Bullock or were watching another movie. Because this movie is not worth more than maximum 3 stars. And that is just because of Sandra's black bikini. Im sorry Winkler, but you made a film that deserves to be on the Bottom 100 here on IMDb. And Im also sorry to all of you who are going to watch this film during your lifetime! A Common Man's Psychological Thriller; The Net (1995). It's hard to assess THE NET as a computer espionage thriller. It is less action than Enemy of the State (1998) and less poignant in some ways that War Games (1983), and not quite as intimately juvenile/teenager and smooth and polished as Antitrust (2001). In some ways The Net is a psychological thriller that depends more on the subtle, covert computer focus than most of the other movies in as such might be considered a much better, pure form of the this subgenre of computer-espionage thriller. There is the mother-daughter subtext as well as the rather powerful deception twist and the friendship and loss scenes that have some impact. Interestingly the climax seems long in coming and the frustration level quite high in this particular movie. Much of Sandra Bullock's behavior and action seem to be consistent and reasonable considering the circumstance she finds herself and fascinating in that she doesn't need to depend on extraordinary measures outside of her on-screen character which in some ways dampens the excitement of the movie but at the same time places it more in the human-reality context. The overall effect is to make the movie less captivating and yet in a strange way more compelling because of its connection to the Everyman. 7/10. mildly entertaining....; note:  some spoilers may be contained. the basic premise of this movie is that sandy bullock comes across some information she is not supposed to have, and spends two hours running from the bad guys. course, ole sandy has her demons...father ran off, mother suffering from memory loss...and pretty much keeps to herself.  so that bad guys (who have the power to break in to all these computers) just steal her identity. i read a comment that this was not a chick flick, but it VERY MUCH is.  the most all common element that draws it in are that all of the males in the film are either the bad guys OR are of no real help to the protagonist.  in my opinion, dennis miller has a pretty good role as her former lover/therapist who is the only person who can identify her, but he quickly gets offed. while it was mildly entertaining, the movie somewhat drug on and was just too predictable. Complete waste of time.; I see no reason to watch this film ever again. Actually I was only watching it for being curious about how much this movie could suck. Unfortunately it did suck big, big time! I am both a movie lover (with a relatively big collection of movies) and a computer geek (system analyst), so I believe I was able to watch the movie from more than just one viewpoint... I just wish they could have used some kind of networking/computer expert to help them out with the technical details and some able writers to avoid the problems they ran into with this movie, but it's always better to make some quick cash with a trendy subject, than making a movie with any historical value. The only good thing in this movie is sexy Sandra Bullock, who is one of my favorite actors. Unfortunately, a good actor can't save a crappy plot. Not even with help from a professional director like Winkler. It's quite obvious that the guys who put together this horrible screenplay had no idea of either computers or how to create some thrill... Naturally, in a movie based on playing around with computers, it's simply impossible to create any of the elements that make a good movie if you have no idea of what you are writing about. I voted 1/10, without Sandra it would have been -1 :P many complicated ways to kill people; Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) is a software beta test consultant. She's a homebody with few friends outside of cyberspace. She collects computer viruses for her friend Dale Hessman. She visits her mom (Diane Baker) in an old age home but she doesn't remember her. Dale sends her a program that seems to access unauthorized sites and then he's killed. She goes on vacation and meets Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam) who turns out to be a cold-hearted killer looking for the program. She barely escapes the attempt on her life and computers are going wrong giving her an alternate identity Ruth Marx. Her life is taken over by Devlin and she's pursued by the police. The only person she can turn to is Dr. Alan Champion (Dennis Miller) who actually knows her in real life. The question is why not just kill her. That seems to be the objective from before. Of course, he's trying to date her. If they want to know who she talked to, why not kidnap her? Torture is so much easier. Also why couldn't she make copies of the disk? Didn't she have access to the program in the hotel? There is a lot of stuff that is questionable even if the computer stuff is reasonable. The stuff surrounding the computer stuff makes little sense. Also the movie insists on killing people in the most complicated ways possible. And it seems like Bullock is always running in this movie. Most of the reviewers here must be born after 1990 or born before 1950; This was made in 1994-1995 at the beginning of the internet craze and the dot-com bubble, and this movie was wholly appropriate for the time era considering many people were just starting to get on the internet at this time. There are a lot of flaws in this film I agree, which is why I have rated it a 6, but my main complaint here is some of the reviewers on this site. Granted this movie was made at the beginning of the internet era, but some people on here make it sound like 1995 was back in the \"horse and buggy\" days. Either they were born after 1990 and don't remember a time without the internet or they are old as heck and were finally dragged down to the computer store just recently by their kids to get their very first computer. REALLY SCARY...AND IT'S NOT EVEN A HORROR FILM; My summary of this film says that it is scary. Why is it scary? Because the character Angela Bennett is alone, she doesn't have a clue what's going on and somebody else has control over her life. The great thing about this film is the fact that the enemy is initially unseen and not easy to beat. The enemy could be anyone...who can Angela Bennett trust? How much control does the enemy have over Angela Bennett? What does he/she/it/they want with her? I felt myself sympathizing with Sandra Bullock in this movie. If that type of situation were to happen to a person in real life then that person would be paranoid beyond belief and no doubt feeling despair. I love films like this where nothing is what it seems and you're never sure who is good and who is bad. Check it out. Worst bad guy in the history of cinema; I joined IMDb simply to review this movie. Specifically to review the bad guy. If you want the lowdown on the substance of the film go directly to other reviews rated 1 - they are very helpful and largely accurate. Jeremy Northam plays the brainbendingly badly written role of Jack Devlin. The acting wasn't bad per se but whoever wrote this stinker of a role (John D Brancato and Michael Ferris you know who you are) needs to go back to Movie Writing 101. Let me paint the picture. Jack Devlin is a smooth talking, handsome and incredibly IT savvy killer. He has a big boat, a gun and a way with words. Problem is he is comically hopeless at catching, much less killing his target - Angela Bennett played by Sandra Bullock. She is a socially inept computer programmer with no pretensions to know how to defend herself much less fight off a killer but spends the whole movie making Jack Devlin look like a first rate buffoon. Here is a summary of the \"killers\" incompetence: First encounter - Jack lures Angela Bennett to a remote location, constructs the theft of her personal belongings, kills a local low fi criminal, jumps on a boat, has a quick very personal physical encounter with a person he is apparently supposed to be killing (what the?) then leaves his gun in his jacket which Bennett puts on. She knocks him out and escapes. D'oh. Second encounter - Bennett's identity has been stolen. He tracks her down and is ready to pounce - except she steals a phone and runs away by sneaking out the toilet window - that old favourite. He follows her in his car but the IT geek gets away on foot. Third encounter - Jack Devlin sends a stooge, pretending to be an FBI agent to collect Bennett from the police station where she is being held. The plan works - except she sees through the ruse. After driving a long way from the cop shop she has been detained in she grabs the wheel of the car and crashes into - wait for it - Jack Devlin's car! Who wrote this stuff! It is diabolical. She gets away from the trained killer on foot again. Ba ha ha. Final encounter - Bennett breaks into a building to do some super mega sneaky IT stuff. Devlin and his accomplice track her down except Devlin jumps in to prevent her IT derring do and presses ESC on the keyboard. With all those IT skills Devlin believes he has smashed per puerile attempt to alert the authorities. But no. Bennett tricked him - he in fact destroyed the whole database that was the reason he was trying to kill her. Yes - by him pressing ESC. So the chase is on. Devlin shoots his female colleague dead. Then gets knocked cold with a fire extinguisher and plummets to his death. What a loser. The only people this \"killer\" killed was a Mexican hustler and his colleague. Despite having a gun and Bennett standing in front of him for about a third of the film he failed to lay a finger on her. Is Devlin the worst role written for a baddie in the movies. I believe the answer is yes. I commend this movie to that very hardcore minority of movie fans who can bear to watch a shocker of a film to find that rough diamond of abominable writing. Just focus on Devlin and you will be laughing from start to finish. The Movie that put me on the NET; A movie about a freelance computer systems analyst who's identity get's erased from the system, as Angela Bennett Sandra Bullock stumbles on conspiracy and corruption while de-bugging a game for a software company she works for. She then has to find how to get her identity back, in chases, fights and computer hacking. Sandra is excellent of course. Excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller; Wow! In my opinion, THE NET is an excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller that will leave you feeling good all over. When I first saw it, I was feeling good all over for days. When Angela (Sandra Bullock) went to Mexico, I thought to myself, \"That is a really nice place to vacation.\" From the moment Jack (Jermey Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) began chasing her, I thought to myself, \"Don't let anything bad happen to her! Please!\" I also took quite a few deep breaths to prevent myself from screaming any more than I already had. On the bright side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. In conclusion, I give this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller four stars. Complete waste of film stock.; I know, I should have learned by now, Hollywood can not be trusted to depict anything realistic involving computers and technology.  But when this movie is used in a class as an example of the Internet as a utopia or dystopia, you really need to question the professor's thinking. Sandra Bullock plays a computer nerd who beta-tests software for some company.  A co-worker, who collects computer viruses (uh, okay...), sends her an interesting example he found in one of their programs.  And of course, everything unravels from there.  \"Starring\" Dennis Miller as a therapist (who she visited, but presumably didn't get much out of the visits) and a bunch of other actors turning in similarly unremarkable performances. First off, this movie would lead one to believe that no one uses PC's (uh, right), since every single computer used is a Mac, even at the convention. At least the writers correctly predicted Macs would be running Unix (in a way).  But there are just so many plot holes and illogical actions that this movie is just a waste of almost two hours.  True, the plot holes aren't Final Destination bad, but they are still glaringly obvious.  It's like the writers took a stock conspiracy film and slapped a weak Internet plot on it. What is this crap?; This is where my boring adventure began. So the computers at my school were all being shut off all day because of some hackers. We spent TWO WHOLE DAYS in my technology class watching this crap on the screen. I decided to take out my iphone and listen to some music but the teacher said \"NO! Put that away and watch this amazing movie featuring Sandra Bullock\" The chick that was married to that one biker dude with all the tattoos and the one that made out with a girl? I gave it some thought and I actually enjoy old movies every now and then so I began to watch it. WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING?! This movie is junk. It's boring. Nobody is going to be entertained. If you want to see Sandra Bullock on a computer all day, making phone calls to 30 something people and making a huge fuss through out the entire movie, then this is the movie for you. The only part that I found entertaining is when she hangs out with some guy on a boat and some how he ends up being one of the bad guys and pulls out his gun and tries to shoot her. He should have so she can be put out of misery already. But anyways, this doesn't make any sense because she somehow manages to knock this guy out with random objects? He faints a couple times and she manages to escape and go to the boat that's next to her and leave. Then she awakens in some weird hospital place and then after this I kinda zoned out because I almost fell asleep. I told you the most entertaining part of the movie. Yes I understand the technology back then was OH MY GOD! She discovered how to order a pizza! Yaaaay! Big hype back in the day. Just don't watch. My teacher made a mistake, all the seniors and juniors in the class looked so out of it. It was the most boring period of my life. Watch something better. This is a comedy for the true Hackers; I will admit, I liked this movie when I was a teenager, mainly because the movie involved computers. But over the years, I have quickly come to realize that this movie is really nothing more than a silly fiction story. First of all, for this exact reason, the government would never ask a single company to knowingly setup something linking all of the government's computer systems. But probably the most comical part of this movie is how everyone says \"our computers are protected by the Gatekeeper System, so it's not possible that anyone could have broke in to change anything.\" Anyone with a reasonable amount of knowledge in the computer industry will tell you that there is no such thing as absolute security. And frequently, finding ways around a security system can be a lot easier than anyone would ever like to think. I also love the end of this movie, where she unleashes the virus on the Gatekeeper System (their obviously unsecured key to absolute security), and they say \"the virus is eating through the Gatekeeper System, nothing will be left, everything will be destroyed!\" All she did was stick the disk in the computer, and it instantly infects the Gatekeeper system, waiting for them to press Esc. By the way, I thought Mac's were supposed to be immune to viruses. LOL I find it interesting how our society becomes more and more attached to technology, yet the people using it seem to become more and more clueless. From what I've seen, the only movie about computers that ever made reasonable sense was made more than two decades earlier... \"WarGames\" The Net; Now this was a blast from the past, my teenage years (I was 17 at the time). It might seem crazy these days but I distinctly remember watching this in the cinema with a friend, and both of us scoffing at how ridiculous the movies premise was. The whole idea of the internet (something that was more of a joke back then) being able to bring down someone's entire life. The idea of people actually having portable computers and being able to use them, online! everywhere! The idea of someone's life revolving around a computer...or more specifically the net, was at the time almost inconceivable (unless you were rich). Yes these were simpler times my friends, back before the internet was an integral part of people's lives, or before the internet was even taken seriously. Hell back then movies like this were the only introduction some people had to the, so called, information highway. This and movies like 'The Lawnmower Man' were pretty much the only things most common people saw of the internet, hence why we all thought it was a gimmicky flash in the pan. Even British videogames TV show 'GamesMaster' would mock the internet with its limited abilities at the time. We were told one day we'd all be surfing the net, we all ridiculed the notion, how wrong we were. Anyway the movie. Systems analyst Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) is accidentally drawn into the dark world of cyber terrorism when her work college sends her sensitive information on a floppy disk (remember those?!). The information revolves around the death of the US Secretary of Defense and a large software company CEO, Jeff Gregg. Whilst on holiday Bennett gets wined and dined by mysterious British gent Jack Devlin whom she starts to have feelings for. But before she knows it this British gent is trying to kill her so he can get his hands on this disk. Following a nasty accident where Bennett tries to escape Devlin, she awakes in hospital to discover her life has been deleted. Bennett must now try and find help to recover her life, evade Devlin, and uncover the truth on the disk. Yeah so the plot is your typical computer hacking/expert, on the run type affair which is now a dated concept. This idea was quite new at the time but director Irwin Winkler really tapped into the public's interest by utilising the newfangled internet contraption. The internet wasn't unheard of at the time of course, but it was intriguing to the masses and was used a lot to present an exciting new angle to movies. It was almost like an unexplored universe and Hollywood wasn't gonna let it slip by without milking its every potential. The other main draw for this movie was actress Sandra Bullock who was literally the biggest thing in Hollywood between 1993 - 1995. Hot off a trilogy of blockbusting hits that were 'Demolition Man', 'Speed' and 'While You Were Sleeping', Bullock could do no wrong. She was America's sweetheart with her adorable, girl next door looks and squeaky clean image. People just went to movies starring Bullock, no questions asked, she was huge. This movie also used the highly unpopular nerd image which was still something to mock at the time. Nowadays nerds are all the rage but back in the day oh no, being a nerd was not cool. But what baffled people even more was the introduction to a sexy female nerd, this was virtually unheard of at the time. This did present a problem for the movie simply because no one believed a sexy female could be a whizz- kid on computers or a nerd. Especially Bullock who was Hollywood's new darling leading lady. And admittedly it is hard to believe Bullock in this role because she simply doesn't look like she understands what shes talking about half the time. She also looks surprisingly unathletic considering her previous action movies, she kinda sleepwalks through this looking bored. Looking back now this movie is fun simply to see all the retro hardware and early programs in action. All these chunky laptops, very basic net page layouts, disk swapping and loading etc...it does bring back many memories. The action is kinda sparse but reasonably thrilling I suppose, it was never gonna be a violent movie with Bullock in the lead. Bullock was the queen of PG-13/12 rated movies. So the movie cuts away for any violence and there is little profanity, if any. Jeremy Northam is easily the best thing about the film with his devilishly charming contract killer, probably why his character is called Devlin. In the end this is a very safe and harmless action thriller that didn't want to rock the boat for its leading lady. Bullock is still cute and cuddly while under the stress of being hunted down by a hit-man. Being a movie about computers director Winkler obviously couldn't pass up a chance to film at the Macworld/iWorld trade show in San Francisco. So naturally the tense unrealistic finale is shot there. It is hilarious to watch Bennett downloading/uploading such large chunks of data onto floppy disks just in the nick of time. I'm just gonna assume that the trade show would have had the best of the best computers on show so that made it possible. Its all very silly, cutesy and charming these days, so amusing to think this was a big serious release back in the day. 5.5/10 TV show is better; Maybe it didn't help that I saw the TV show first when that came out in 1998, but over all, I think the show was better than the movie. Sure Sandra Bullock is a great actress, but I think she's better in other movies myself. The movie lacked the show's closeness with all the characters, the good guys and the bad guys. We never really got to know anyone up close, not even Angela, which made it kind of hard to understand. It also seemed to jump around a lot, from one place to another without connecting anything. Over all, I think they could have done a much better job, taking out half the characters that were supposedly on her side, which ended up dead before the movie was half over. It was a good movie to some degree, but it required a lot of help, to make it even better. In the end, if you can, watch the TV show instead. You give us the disk and we'll give you your life back!; ***SPOILERS*** Quick paced thriller involving computer analyst Angela Bennett, Sandra Bullock, who unknowingly got her hands on this mysterious floppy disk that she was testing for a computer virus. The disk's information can put an end to the dreams of multi-billionaire founder of the \"Gatekeeper Security System\" Jeff Grege, Gerald Berns. Grege has been trying to get the US Defense Department-the Pentagon-to install his system but Defense Secretary Michael Bergstrom, Ken Howard, was dead set against it. With Grege using the \"Gatekeeper\" to hack into Bergstrom's medical records it falsified them stating that he's suffering from an advance and fatal case of AIDS! This had Bergstrom, whom were told was homophobic, in knowing that he doesn't have long to live go out into a nearby D.C park and blow his brains out. With Bergstrom's replacement Calvin Shoemaker now running the show-Defense Department-the \"Gatekeeper\" is a given but as usual-in computer science- there's a glitz: The geeky and shut-in computer analyst Angela Bennett! Actually Angela got the explosive, that revealed the true nature of the \"Gatekeeper System\", disk from her on-line contact, and fellow computer nerd, Dale Hessman, Ray McKinnon. It was Dale's misfortune to get himself killed in a suspicious plane crash just before he was to get the disk-from Angela-back. With her now in possession of the \"Gatekeeper\" disk Angela's life was turned into a living hell for knowing its contents. On the run from the police and hit-man Jack Devlin, Jeremy Northam, who's working for the \"Gatekeeper Project\" Angela in her choosing to be locked up in her her home, as a computer expert, for some six years has no one who can vouch for her identity as Angela Bennett! Having all her personal belongings stolen-by Devlin-on a trip to Mexico,her first vacation in six years, Angela has been given the bogus identity, by those out to get her, of Ruth Marx a convicted felon! With the police as well as hit-man Devlin on her tail Angela has to prove who she is and at the same time convince the authorities, both federal as well as sate, what Jeff Grege is planning to do. Disrupt the entire US economic and transportation systems with his \"Gatekeeper Project\" and at the same time prevent, by having it installed in the Pentagon, his evil plan from being uncovered! ****SPOILERS**** The movie \"The Net\" was made in early 1995 years before the internet became known, as well as available, to most of those watching it at the time of its release. Despite its very confusing storyline and almost inconceivable climax with the release, by Angela, of a super computer virus the film is still fascinating, now with the internet a major factor in everyone's lives, to watch. We can see how ahead of its time \"The Net\" was in bringing out back then in 1995 which was considered science fiction to what became, engineered computer economic crimes and identity theft, science fact just a few years later!</td>\n",

       "      <td>A good laugh; This short animation tells the story of Scrat who loves his nut, and does everything to protect the nut. This time, he is in a spaceship trying to save his nut from zero gravity situation. However, he accidentally activates the spaceship and the numerous unbelievable functions, causing chaos in space. This is further complicated by aliens showing up to snatch his nut. The first half of the animation is very familiar to me, as I watched it in the new \"Ice Age\". The second half has new scenes which are quite funny. Though each time I keep thinking that the idea of Scrat and his nut is getting very old and beaten, I still get a laugh every time I watch it. Scrat, the adorable saber-toothed squirrel; First of all, loved it! Yet another Scrat adventure and it was awesome. Causing chaos left and right only for trying to hold on to his beloved acorn. I am a big animation fan and I enjoy Ice age, but it would not be the same without Scrat. Not because he is somewhat the driver of the story line (in my opinion) but because he is hilarious to watch and can only be praised for his effort trying to achieve the impossible over and over again. And for those who like Ice Age and love Scrat, watching all his shorts in one go is like watching a Scrat movie and I hope they will continue this until they run out of ideas for Ice Age. Great animation and a lot of laughs from start to finish. This should be called Scrat: F*ck Out; ¿A 14 Mini Movie minute about Scrat? How stupid can be. This is not a Mini Movie, is a clip comparison of ALL THE SCENES OF SCRAT of Ice Age: Collision Course. Including some deleted scenes animated. Scrat: F*ck Out (Oh, i'm sorry, \"Scrat: Spaced Out\"), i'ts nothing that 14 minutes waste of time. Not a single joke was funny, the story is stupid and Scrat as a character is unfunny and disappointing. Yes, the animation is good ¿And what?. This is more \"Ice Age: Without the heard\". It doesn't need your Attention. This is the must unfunny and unoriginal animated short of Scrat I ever seen. If your a fan, just don't watched. Just kill the franchise now. 3/10 Scrat as usual, just longer and in space; \"Scrat: Spaced Out\" is a 2016 animated short film and as such the newest addition to the \"Ice Age\" franchise. Many Scrat short films exist and most of these are really short, but this one here runs for a \"massive\" 15 minutes which is unusual for the films about this character. I guess they still keep making these because of the success (Oscar-nominated) of the early ones. Yeah well, there is not a lot more to say. There was another Scrat short film from last year when he is in space and this new Ice Age full feature film (which was actually very weak) has a connection to space and meteors as well, so this subject seems to be really en vogue for the franchise here. But back to this Scratventure (oh yes I did!). The title character is basically flying through space, sometimes in a capsule, sometimes outside and tries to get a hand on his acorn as always. And as if Scrat was not struggling enough already with natural aspects, he also has to deal with a bunch of supernatural alien creatures (that look like Scrat in other color, female and in space suits). I must say the only funny scene in here was probably the one that involved the other Ice Age characters in a solid little reference. Other than that, I was neither impressed nor entertained, but then again i have never been a really big Scrat fan. His films jumped the shark a long time ago if you ask me, if they even made it up the shark to be honest. I don't recommend this newest films. Thumbs-down.</td>\n",

       "13262  Unbelievable piece of misogyny plus techy unknowledge.; The lack of techy care in the movie is noted well in other reviews. No plot details here, as many other users give that. Just to clear up something elsewhere noted...easy to miss, as it's one line in a single conversation. The reason no one at Angela's office recognizes her and she doesn't go to the Chronicle building to use the computer is: she has never been to SF or her office. She works out of her home in Venice Beach (near L.A.), making her a telecommuter before that was common, and incidentally pointing how very very good at \"legit hacker work\" she is supposed to be, that the company allows this. My comment concerns Sandra Bullock's character itself. Angela is supposed to be a supremely competent computer nerd on the level of a hacker, who is pretty much out of it socially. It makes sense that she is such a moron in regards to the men in the movie. But it's asinine that this extremely knowledgeable and competent woman would fly around squeaking \"help me help me!\" like a subnormally intelligent barefoot and pregnant little woman, taking actions like pressing every button on a radio three times fast and randomly while squeaking \"help me! help me!\" into the mic after the first murder attempt, make not the slightest attempt to protect herself (or anyone else) from the myriad and one things computers control which she obviously knew all about before any of this started, never be at all wary of anyone or anything until the movie is almost over...in short, she acts like the housewifey computer illiterate unable to even figure out the remote for the TV type awash in a sea of confusion throughout the movie, and the few moments of her sitting at some desk somewhere using some computer as if she knows all about it as well as the other character's comments about her switching servers and covering her tracks all ring utterly false because of it. This broad so clearly could not figure out how to hit the power button by herself, there is no way she would be able to handle a comp, much less do any of the things she supposedly does. That ruins an otherwise fun, if not technologically accurate, movie. Let's hope next time around Bullock's part isn't destroyed by a writer who believes that any woman who is good in a \"males only\" job must be shown up as really being the \"typical\" hysterical idiot female. (Anyone remember the can't be explained away by saying its supposed to be a comedy equally totally asinine incompetent female character Bullock portrayed in \"MS Congenialty\"?) Good Suspense;  Bullock Tolerable For Once; This is a typical Sandra Bullock movie in which she plays a mousy (but profane) woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero. Sound familiar? There are plenty of holes in this story. Things just don't add up and some of the suspense is a little corny. But - that suspense is very good. There is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it. The story starts off slow but kicks in pretty soon and stays that way, making it an involving movie for the viewer. That's why I give it a pretty good rating - the movie gets you involved in it. Bullock is more cute than annoying, which she normally is to me, so this is my highest-rated movie with her in it. Love this film; I never tire of watching this movie. I love it every time I watch it, which is often. Of course Sandra Bullock was made for this role. Dennis Miller does a fine job also. I am not very computer savvy, but I had no trouble following the parts of the movie to do with technology. With all the hacking of store accounts now, the plot is even more timely than when it was produced. it is also fun to make note of advances in technology - no more floppy disks. It is a cautionary tale for us all to watch our passwords and the information we let out. It can be enjoyed as a commentary of the times or as a fun movie to watch. No it is not one of the all time great movies,but it is timely and good entertainment. Pure entertainment; I enjoyed this film when I first saw it back in 1995, long before I  became Net savvy.  Let's face it: this film came out before ANYBODY was really that Net savvy.   Now, years later, the technology is unrealistic.  But if you see it as an interesting character, moving the plot along, rather than something to be dissected, it's a fun ride.  Think of it as that robot you saw way back when in Lost in Space--of course he was cardboard, but, boy, wasn't he cool?   I enjoyed Sandra Bullock in this role.  Pretty or not, I could imagine how lonely it could have been to be a women in technology in those days--visit any computer conference and you'll note that even now, we're a bit scarce.  And, I am a Mac Addict, so I'll willingly accept a movie world where Apple is the predominant technology.   I yearn for the innocent days of The Net.  The last time I went to see a so-called tech film, I was treated to John Travolta's character --in what was that, Swordfish?--utilizing it to sexually dehumanize women and murder dozens of people.  I will take Sandra Bullock saving the world with a floppy disk at MacWorld any day. Great movie, timely plot, pertinent points, and excellent portrayals.; I loved this movie! Movies and plays fulfill their purpose when they expose social, political, and other problems that affect the majority. This movie served that purpose. I identify with the plot and know people to whom this has happened. At the time this movie was made, concepts presented in this flick were advanced for the public, yet had already happened to friends of mine by way of people in powerful positions. And, I know what it is like when people do to you what they did to Angela Bennett, because they have done it to me. I greatly enjoyed Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Angela Bennett/Ruth Marx. She portrays a pretty, intelligent, and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid giving up to overwhelming odds, fight hard to keep her sanity and restore her life, and try to protect those whom she loves. Losing her self-concept and succumbing to that age-old attempt to bolster a sagging self esteem by indulging in sex with a stranger added a poignant touch of reality. The climax of the plot reveals the only real solution to this kind problem. Enjoyable but disposable; Sandra Bullock stars in a film which felt like it could have been much better. The premise, a trojan horse \"security\" product allowing the villains to alter data held on computers around the world and gain control through computer manipulation was interesting and the action set pieces successful, but the film was insufficiently engaging to make one really care about the outcome. Oh.  Gee.  Another Chase movie; Other then updating for the information age, The Net isn't particularly different than any other \"One person on the run by a vast global conspiracy - nobody believes her.\"  The biggest suspension of disbelief is that Sandra Bullock's character is a computer nerd, and that drags down what little  \"realism\" the pic may have.  Other than that, it's by-the-numbers chases, escapes, betrayals, and friends dying. What computers?; This movie is such a piece of unbelievable crap. First let me talk about the pros: Sandra Bullock in a black bathing suit. Now the rest of the story which is all pretty much bad. We have said computer programmer Angela Bennett (who's online profile is ANGEL - HOW WITTY!!! I bet the directors cheered over that one for an hour) who basically checks other Company's software for errors/glitches etc. So we start with her ordering pizza on the Internet and then putting on a fireplace on her monitor (EXTREME computer skills shown thus far). This is after she finds some virus on a macintosh program which crashes the whole system after hitting the escape key. This is apparently a HUGE problem yet the virus created to do such could be done in about 1 minute with a simple batch file. Any event, we move on. She gets this call from some other bloke (that works at the same company) and this fool says to go click this symbol which apparently opens up some secret Internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected 'top secret' data woohoo! Angela saves this crap on a disc and now the people that created this loophole are out to get her. This of course is only after she hooks up with one of the bad guys only BEFORE he tries to kill her BEFORE she jumps in the ocean off his boat, BEFORE she winds up in a random hospital. Problem #1: You can't create a loophole on the Internet to gain access to a bunch of top secret FBI data. Where the hell did this come from? Since when can a group of hackers control the basic flow of the Internet (even in 95)? Problem #2: Angela would need proper identification before a hospital or clinic would release her. She could not just pack her things and go. Then these 'hackers' or whatever change Angela's ID so she can't get help from anyone and conveniently enough all her ID is gone. So she returns home and a cat and mouse chase goes on and on and on. Apparently all police and FBI people are stupid and don't believe her. So then she has to utilize a bunch of tactics to enter into the building where she works (where the person who is now filling in for her is) and get back to her old computer. She starts talking to some other random bloke and finds out who is behind everything through some BS IP address that the director knows the audience is too stupid enough to believe. Then she runs to some center to mail all this information to the FBI. She apparently HAS to use a mainframe to email stuff to the FBI. But then the same fool that tried to kill her BEFORE throwing her in the water catches her and easily hacks into the FBI again (wtf?). But remember that cool virus? Well somehow she luckily gets that and even though the virus only worked on software, it now works on the entire system too. It brings down the whole mainframe which has all the fake information because the mainframe was just sitting in the middle of some convention... WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP! Anyway, the now uber virus works and Angela (the real one now) runs away and later kills the evil dude with a fire extinguisher. He of course has a gun, runs up to her so he's like 2 feet away and then decides to aim. CLASSIC Hollywood. All in all this movie is so full of BS and crap. Anyone who doesn't know a lot about computers will be wildly fooled into thinking this crap is possible but not one thing is accurate concerning computers or the net. And I honestly doubt I'd see a multiplatform virus for Mac and a mainframe computer (*cough LMAO*). The Net when it started; When this movie firt came out in 1995, I found it amazingly great. Especially with Sandra Bullock.After having watched her brilliant performance in Speed , i was ready to enjoy any of her movies. Back to The Net, it was a movie that keeps you in suspence.All in all, i enjoyed it so I give it a  **** out of *****. PLEASE!!! THERE IS NO DISCUSSION! THE NET IS A GREAT MOVIE!!!; I don't know who gave this movie a half of a star, but I am a huge fan of Sandra Bullock, and all of her work.  I am totally obsessed with this movie, not only because it is Sandra Bullock, but because it was so well written, and because it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time you watch it!  GREAT MOVIE! Please see it! You will love it! The action is great, and it is so neat to see how everything fits together in the end! Excellent A+! Her driver's license. Her credit cards. Her bank accounts. Her identity. DELETED.; The net is an excellent movie! It's about Angela Bennett(in a great performance of Sandra Bullock) who is a computer expert who works for the Cathedral Company, cleaning virus and testing games for the clients. Angela is a typical nerd who doesn't have friends outside of the cyberspace,almost doesn't take vacations and go out, and stays almost all the time connected. One day her friend Dale Hessman(Ray McKinnon) asks her to help him,sending Angela a disk with a strange program that has many confidential informations. At the same night, when Dale was going to meet her, he is suddenly killed in a plane crash.Going to Mexico in her vacation,Angela meets a beautiful guy called Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam)who shows to be a cold blood killer bastard and one of the guys behind all the secret of the Diskette. Her life then turns into a nightmare: All her records are erased and she is given the new identity of Ruth Marx, a woman with serious problems with the police. This movie is great because it shows how we, humans,depend a lot of the computers and machines(sometimes more that we should) and how vulnerable we are if someday ,someone decides to control and change our personal records,without letting us the chance to prove the error. Very good thriller; I'm quite a fan of thriller movies, and remembered seeing this movie before it came on TV one night. I hardly remembered any of it, but watched it anyway. Boy, I was in for a lot. Sandra Bullock is great in this, we feel her loneliness, and get to like her as the film moves on. Angela Bennet is a woman who basically fixes computer viruses for a job. She is sent a top secret disc, that has massive power in the wrong hands. As she goes on holiday, it is stolen by a man, who is using it's power to access \"The Net\" to delete Angela's identity. Angela returns home, signing under the name of \"Ruth MArx\" so she can access the USA. But her house has been sold, no one remembers her, her car isn't there, and she has no one to state that she is Angela Bennet. She now has to stay away from the police, who think she is the outlaw Ruth MArx, AND uncover the Conspiracy behind the Disc, the man that stole it and a huge Software company. There are lots of suspense scenes when you'll be shouting \"GET OUT THE ROOM!\" at the camera, and lots of action as well. I really cant see why this got a bad review, the only bad point is that the computers in this movie age it quite a bit, and that the plot/conspiracy is a tiny bit hard to understand. But you'll have fun watching this. A technically acurate thriller; Out of the recent genre of \"Big Brother\" computer plots this one has to be the most believable. No fancy whiz-kid hackers that break into FBI mainframe files in seconds. Irwin Winklers ability to bring reality into a thriller gives it the credibility that says \"This could happen - this could be me!\" Full marks for a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat based just on good scriptwriting and acting alone! If you like this one, \"Enemy of the State\" is worth looking at as well. Unwatchable; Are you kidding me? This movie is terrible. The plot twists can be seen a mile away by a blind man. There are big enough holes in the plot that a semi could be driven through them. Sandra Bullock is a charming actress, but the question is why would she make this movie? Dumb question, the answer of course is for a truck load of money. The script resorts to every cliche ever used in a thriller. From unnecessary chases that move the story along not at all to authorities that don't believe a word the victim says, we have seen this all before. And quite frankly, we have seen it done a hell of a lot better than it was done here. I can't even watch this movie because it is so methodical in letting you know what is going to happen next. It is just irritating. Unrealistic but still good; There is no doubt that Sandra Bullock can act, she also has a great deal of stage presence, she showed great chemistry with Dennis Miller and I'm gonna be bold enough to say that Sandra Bullock made this movie what it is. However, I had a problem with the unrealistic way the movie portrayed the Net. All those graphics (like the \"Mozart's Ghost\" one) were able to be saved on a floppy disk (when in reality, you need a zip drive to fit a file like that) and the Net wouldn't be able to handle that much graphic without Java or any other applet. When computers are concerned, it wasn't very realistic, and don't even get me started on that virus! But I gotta admit, I enjoyed watching this tech movie. Although for people who have no idea how the Net goes, this kind of movie will awaken feelings of paranoia and the notion that the Net is a horrible place. But I like this movie. I have always loved chase movies, but this isn't the typical chase movie, I don't know, I think it's the use of technology that makes it special. I give it a well-deserved **** I recommend it to anyone. We Ante In Microchips Now; For anyone who has ever logged on to the internet (and of course you have!) this movie will have you looking over your shoulder and seeking enrollment in a twelve step program for computer addiction.  `The Net,' directed by Irwin Winkler, stars Sandra Bullock as a computer nerd who has her identity-- her whole life, in fact-- snatched away from her with the stroke of a single key.  Angela Bennett (Bullock) is a computer whiz kid who works out of her home finding flaws in and debugging new programs sent to her on disc by her employer.  One day she inadvertently stumbles across one that is so big it sets off a chain reaction of intrigue that places her at the eye of the storm, though she hasn't a clue as to what it's all about.  All she knows is that suddenly she's not herself any more; at least according the records stored on hard drives everywhere.  And it's only the beginning of complications, the likes of which would give anyone with even the slightest bit of paranoia nightmares. \\tWith a plot that would make Kafka proud, this precursor to the even more paranoia-inducing `Enemy Of The State,' is a dark, cautionary tale of the misuse of a  technology that has quickly encompassed virtually every walk of life, yet without anyone having first harnessed the full fury of it's potential.  A work of fiction?  Of course; one could even say `science' fiction.  But in this case the technology is already in place, and anyone who wants YOU badly enough need look no further than the data base of the DMV, a credit card bureau or the Post Office, and they will quickly know more about you than you know yourself.  For those who would scoff, there's an old adage that goes something like:  Anything that can be used `for' you can also be used `against' you.  At the very least it's food for thought that could keep those with opposing views on the matter debating endlessly.  Or, as in this case of this movie, it's enough to drive the average computer hacker to the brink of madness.  Shades of Lovecraft. \\tAt any rate, Winkler has given us an engrossing film that is intense and so exasperating, as you can only sit by and watch helplessly as he puts Angela through her paces, while Bullock makes it all convincing with an excellent performance, making Angela believable as an average girl-next-door whose frame of reference doesn't go much beyond her computer screen.  And all without making her too innocent or naive; she strikes an honest chord with her character that makes her one with whom the audience can readily identify, which is one of the strengths of the movie.  She evokes such empathy that it's easy to feel what it would be like to be in her place; and through her eyes, it's not a pretty sight.   \\tThe supporting cast includes Jeremy Northam (Jack), Dennis Miller (Alan), Diane Baker (Mrs. Bennett), Wendy Gazelle (Ruth Marx) and Ken Howard (Bergstrom). Along with the dawning of a new age in technology comes the birth of a new era in fiction that will forevermore be fueled by the microchip.  And if `The Net' is any indication, buckle your seat belts, because it's going to be an intense, bumpy-- and highly entertaining-- ride (as already evidenced by `The Matrix,' as well as the aforementioned `EOTS').  It's inevitable that the questions of possibility or probability will arise, especially when a film like this has a contemporary setting; but the most important thing to remember is that if projects such as this fall into capable hands, we'll all be in for some exciting cinema.  It's all a matter of using the magic wisely.  I rate this one 6/10. Mediocre Internet crime thriller; Mediocre Internet crime thriller which starts OK, but then lacks development and turns pretty much into Sandra Bullock being chased around by lots of nasty but clever people who also delete/steal her passport, credit cards, work, insurance records and everything else. The \"reason\" for all mayhem is fairly lame  and to me some of these events appeared to occur in the wrong logical order. Also, all the impossible computer hacks were cloaked by use of buzzwords/fancy graphics to make it sound and look like they knew what they were doing. I preferred Disclosure. Suspenseful but with a human story; \"The Net\" is a fantastic film. Sandra Bullock is funny, refreshing, and tragic by turns, as a \"nobody\" caught in the middle of a major conspiracy to take over the Internet, and thereby, our very lives. Like many good films, \"The Net\" lets us see things from various points of view at once. When Angela is trying to explain her predicament to her court-appointed lawyer, we can see her paranoia as both understandable from her point of view and as the typical defensive craziness that her public defender might see. Jeremy Northam is perfect as the bad guy who can't seem to decide whether he wants to prolong the sexual tension of the chase or just kill her and get it over with. As one other reviewer here has noted, this film is very Hitchcockian. It reminded me of \"Strangers on a Train\": the carousel scene seems to be a direct reference to \"Train,\" and the whole theme of Angela meeting a stranger who then takes over her life is very similar. The film is very skillfully edited for suspense. For example, the scene on the boat when Angela discovers the gun: she is shown just discovering it right before Devlin comes up to the deck, but by the time he gets there, she's quite prepared for his arrival, although you think she's a goner. This sort of editing is masterful and really adds to the suspense. The scene where she confronts Devlin on the boat is my favorite: I just love how she says \"So.... who are you...Jack?\" -- she gives the word \"Jack\" just the right staccato emphasis. Devlin's response is classic, and gives away his \"badness\" perfectly; and then the camera focusing on only half his face at a time (eyes/mouth) is perfect, also. This recalls the camera's focus on Angela's mouth when she's typing to the chat room before. The implication is that we are just mouths on the Internet (typing words) and eyes in real life (sexual attraction), and we have to connect the two somehow. I also liked the use of names: \"Champion\" for Angela's only friend, \"Devlin\" for the devilishly evil Jack, \"Angela\" (often shortened to \"Angel\") to denote Angela's essential innocence. Angela's mother having Alzheimer's reinforces Angela being cut off from people -- the person she's closest to doesn't even remember her name. I always get teary during the scene where she's trying to get her mom to identify her to the cop (although Angela calling her may be putting her mom in danger, it's a very human thing for her to do). Over the course of the movie, we see Angela changing: she's starting to value her friends and family more, and realizing that she's been cut off from people. Ironically, Devlin is one of the instruments of her growing understanding, when he tells her that \"we're really very similar, you and I.\" She's shocked into realizing that she *is* tied to her family (such as it is) with a bond of love (even her defense of her absentee father to Champion brings us some insight into her feeling for her family). This attachment to people is something neither Devlin nor the \"imposter Angela\" can understand (for example, the \"imposter Angela\" looks around at the computer convention and says: \"Let's get outta here, all these people are making me nervous\"). Annie Lennox's cover of \"Whiter Shade of Pale\" is used in the film, most appropriately. Angela is a \"vestal virgin\" in many ways, who must go through some pretty psychedelic experiences to find herself. An important aspect of this film is obviously its portrayal of a brief moment in history when only a few organizations and hackers were aware of the vast potential of the Internet. Because this film was made in 1995, it conveys the feeling of \"newness\" of all the technology. This makes Angela's isolation from others both easier to understand (weren't all hackers at that time isolated from those who had no idea what the \"Internet\" was?) and more frightening: will we all soon succumb to the Net's seductive pull? The computer aspects of the film were actually quite impressive: if not totally realistic for the technology of the time, at least the film has aged well. For the time it was made, the film's understanding of the role the Internet would play in our lives was almost prophetic. The main point about the use of the technology in the film, however, is that it does *not* override the human story. Overall, I recommend this film as highly entertaining and suspenseful, with the theme of the dangerous implications, for both the individual and society, of our new computer technology. Not one fact correct; Got a peak of this movie for the second time a week ago and I just had to react to the incredible amount of errors in the movie. OK, so the Internet was quite new in the days when the movie was made, but that doesn't mean they have to make it wrong. The movie can't beat the \"virus-uploading-scene\" in ID4, but it's not far from. I don't wanna spam this comment with all errors made, I just wanna point out that if you like movies that make sense don't see this one. If it wasn't for Sandra Bullock I would never had seen the full movie. Net of mistakes; Rating: *1/2 out of **** \"The Net\" is one of those films that won't remain in your mind till the next one hour. Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is. It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage. One of those adjectives I've just used above is the reason which made me add 1/2 a star to the one I would have given. So is it a case of 'so bad it is good'? No. It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'. Bullock in a (surprise!) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time. She works at home, doesn't have any friends and her neighbors don't know her. Suddenly, she sees herself involved in dangerous situations, after her colleague dies and the same thing almost happens to her. Her identity, bank accounts, etc, etc, etc, are all deleted, and she is now Ruth Marx. The conspiracy involves even the government and... Wait! Haven't we seen this before? Yes, thousands of times. \"The Net\" tries to be modern, to be the portrait of the '90s, showing the computer as a villain. Big deal! It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes. Take the scene of the boat accident. I just laughed when the camera started to get slow... What makes everything even worse here is Sandra Bullock. How awful she is! Has she already made a decent film? \"A Time to Kill\", okay. But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures. The vantages and disadvantages of the computer were already shown in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", the best, most intelligent and most complex film ever made. It's not needed to compare \"The Net\" with it, is it...? The only reason to see \"The Net\" is to laugh, as I've said, and to see what it tried to be. The results, well, are a shame. DELETE this film from your mind! It's not rocket science but...; You could get into the nitty gritty of this film, and say how it couldn't happen, or how could the main character just walk into offices and start using computers etc without someone noticing and really pick the movie to bits...or you could just sit back with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the acting. Personally, I prefer the latter, I live real life and watch the news with all it's doom and gloom, and so would much rather be entertained by my movies, and see the bad guys get their just rewards.  Don't take it too seriously, and you can thoroughly enjoy this film. Sandra's ok to me!; I really like Sandra Bullock in all acting, but the net was the best! I don't care if the virus screens were a little fake, I liked it and bought it! I have seen it 10 times and are ready for more. Regards, RT woman is pursued by killers who want her floppy; Sandra Bullock portrays a computer nerd who comes into possession of a valuable floppy. A mysterious group want the software, and are willing to kill her for it. They move on her as she is on vacation, wiping her identity out making it impossible to return home. An exciting chase ensues with a thrill a minute. One of Sandra's best. Interesting movie; I saw this movie on TV. It was one of those movies that really make you think. It was thrilling and fun to watch. Great entertainment! I give it an 8 out of 10. Underdone Internet Thriller; A fantastic premise that bears no fruit. I am sure there's a great espionage thriller in the Internet somewhere, but this half-baked idea from co-writer/director Irwin Winkler is dreadfully underdone. \"The Net\" is seriously lacking in character development, so we never get a chance to delve into the minds of the players involved in this story of a computer freak who accidentally stumbles across a program which allows access to restricted sub-nets like the air traffic control network, and several other highly sensitive computer systems. Before poor Angela Bennet knows what's happening, she's fleeing for her life and trying to convince someone of the existence of the evil organisation that is infiltrating the Internet. The half-decent plot turns out very pedestrian in the hands of Winkler. Admittedly there wasn't a great deal he could do with this neglected yarn, but he appears to have gambled on the chance that the clever premise would alone be enough to carry the entire show. Not so! \"The Net\" is an enjoyable entertainment though, thanks to Sandra Bullock's natural every-girl appeal - she may not have the face of a model, and she's no Jodie Foster, but somehow Sandra manages to keep you interested in what's happening to her. Bullock not only carries the limping storyline, but the 'along for the ride' support cast as well. Mark Isham's score is catchy, but not utilised nearly enough. Good fun, but \"Disclosure\" it is not. Looking forward to a real Internet nail biter! Tuesday, November 7, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema A decent if (dated) thriller -which only makes it more fun; I caught this on TV the other night and stuck with it. Its seriously dated now (1995) and laughable in terms of computer technology and giant cell phones but still a good thriller for the most part. Actually all the outdated technology just ended up making this kind of fun and campy. I think its the hook of Sandra's entire identity being erased and replaced with that of a wanted criminal that's so good -scary and intriguing there. The bad guy (Jeremy Northam) becomes very one dimensional after his initial charm wears off but Sandra Bullock does a great job all the way through, with lots of running and evading of the cyber thugs. This opens with Angela Bennett, a reclusive computer programmer who works from home, orders pizza online and only associates with her cyber friends. After she unwittingly comes into possession of software that allows access to secret government information Angela's life is put in danger as the bad guys try to gain access to the floppy disk, culminating with them deleting all evidence of her existence. Dennis Miller plays her sort of boyfriend here and there is a brief cameo from Ron Howard. I always forget how AIDS paranoid we were in the early 90's. 4/11/15 I enjoyed it; I thought this was an exciting thriller. Sandra does a wonderful job in her role. The most interesting thing about it is, that this could easily happen. That is what makes this whole movie so scary. You never know whom you will meet, in real life or on the internet. Our lives are on the computer. All of our information is on the computer. We sometimes can never know who to trust. This movie was very well paced. It started kind of slow, but it helped show us who Angela Bennett was. I know there are people out there who would love to have Angela Bennett's job, and not have to deal with the outside world. All in all, an enjoyable movie. One I can watch over and over. Sandra Bullock and dial up modems!; Think back to 1995, did you even know what I.D. theft was? Well Michael Ferris and John Brancato did, and at the time, it wasn't really that scary. In the film, Sandra Bullock lives alone, spending most of her time fixing her company's computers online. She seems to rarely go out or socialize except with others by computer. She even orders her food over the computer, and it's delivered. Because she keeps to herself, hardly anyone knows her personally, and her mother is in a nursing home with Alzheimer's Disease, so she doesn't remember her. Her only friend is an ex boyfriend, who happens to be a psychiatrist, and she's broken up with him. The fact that she's so incognito has a lot to do with the film. Before leaving for her first vacation in years, she get's a call from a friend in her company who is confused about a weird disk that's come into his possession, and wants her to help him. Not willing to figure it out over the phone or on the computer, he tells her he needs to see her in person and he's flying to her home in L.A. He never arrives... The cast is great, with Sandra Bullock pulling out all the stops in her fight for what is right. There are no sex scenes, no violence or over-indulgent special effects, just content. Every movie lover should own a copy of this film as an example of how to make a film without over indulgence and heavy reliance on effect.. This is a film that can be viewed several times, with each time revealing a little more detail. There is less obvious comedy and glamour in this role, but Sandra Bullock is excellent and intense, as the woman fighting for her life, and ends on a happy note caring for her Mother, and with a new status, working from a new home. There were a lot of conspiracies in this movie, in my opinion its a film that makes you really think how controlled your life is by the internet. Very compelling story. Overall rating: 8 out of 10. Wonderful; When I first saw this movie, I was blown away at how realistic it was. Everything in this movie could really have happened and it gives us a different view on the Internet and the control someone could have in a position like the baddies have in this movie.  You genuinely feel for Sandra Bullock's character in this movie.  Great performances from all actors and thank you to the director for making such a brilliant movie. I like this movie very much!; Just a short comment! I want to say that I like this movie very much! Sandra Bullock is my favourite actress. I like the whole story, from the beginning until the end! I have it on tape and I can watch it a 100 times, it doesn't matter!!! If you are true to yourself, you needn't overcast.; The Net is a glass of onion martini. I have no doubt that Sandra Bullock falls for the taste. Though too many efforts have been made to foreshadow the climax that comes too late, the movie is still thrilling especially in the cat-and-mouse chasing scenarios and near the end of the story. Bullock's performance has great weight with the box office. That's what we call Bullock influence, bigger than the film itself. She is low-key and she never overdraws her roles. Maybe that's because she is acting herself. If you are true to yourself, you needn't overcast. This is much a self-independent, self-help story, a predecessor of \"Flight Plan\". These women are really heart breakers because of their braveness in desperation. Helpless, desperate, fragile yet stubborn, they want to survive this jungle-law world. If Weaker or less intelligent, they will be devoured mercilessly. There are heaps of \"innocent people being wrongly accused\" movies. Maybe it reflects our tastes. The movie is well-crafted. It covers the affection a daughter has for her mother who's caught senile dementia; deals with tenderness a psychologist shows to his former patient and lover; as well as admiration and hatred an assassin entertains to his target. They were tangled up to make the movie a little bit overloaded. Jeremy Northam is blessed with the role as the assassin who is more complex than we see those in other movies. Bullock's roles are stereotyped, mostly\" nobody turning to a big hero\". She is still likable. Harmless filler; OK, I didn't watch this film for accuracy nor was I expecting a true \"thriller\". I like Sandra Bullock a lot, and this was a film of hers I hadn't seen before, so I rented it. While You Were Sleeping is so dear to my heart (my favorite movie), but I wanted to see Sandra in something a little different. This slick movie was quite a departure for her. Not only for Bullock, but for Jeremy Northam, who was amazing as Mr. Knightley in Emma. But his villain is too cartoonish to really be believable, but that might be the writers' fault and not his. Anyway, The Net is fun, but to me it got pretty boring and tedious towards the end. Nothing great, but OK. not too realistic, but what it portrays should be a cause for concern; When \"The Net\" was first being advertised, the ads made it look ridiculous. Then, when I saw it, it was actually quite good. Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) spends her days working on the computer and has never gotten to know her neighbors. Then, through a series of events, her identity gets erased by a cabal of shadowy people, and she can't prove that she exists. Some parts of the movie are a little bit far-fetched; you'd probably know which parts if you saw the movie. Still, it's a good look into what the existence of the Internet may have wrought on unsuspecting people. I do recommend it. Beauty (black bikini) and beast (absurd computers); Why a rating of 5? Because 10 stars go to to Sandra's black bikini... To be more precise, to Sandra's wonderful body and her amazing face shot in close up. 0 stars go to everything else, especially the way they present software. I suppose that the at the time Apple managers sponsored the film, just to destroy their own brand: A computer network that's so easy to hack and that lies about everything was not the best way to promote Apple... Thanks God Steve Jobs returned back and stopped immediately those ultra expensive, self destroying ad campaigns. If you love Sandra Bullock, watch this movie, it's worth it. Otherwise forget it. I like just about any movie with Sandra Bullock; This could be a spoiler, I have to say that I only thought 5 of the scenes were hokey and not of them had to do with computers. Whoever did the technical review and technical advising of the script was not very thorough. The boat scene was dumb, I drove one of those when I was 6 years old um I am sure Sandra even though she plays a blonde sometime with all that computer experience would have been smart enough to figure out how to operate that boat. And the IP address and the search for the IP address through the routers was technically incorrect along with the who is search through a router. IP addresses in the 300 range are incorrect. The search wouldn't have gotten past the first 300 number it would have said subnet range is incorrect when you tried to type it the first time. So they didn't want people going out searching/hacking that IP address use an address 10.15.224.30 at that point you could have shown that address a million times and no one is hacking anything. It wont route. And then there is the scene where Dennis Miller is intubated but hey hes quiet that way! ty but no gr8 thrillr! Not 2 bad tho @s far as xciting 'net movies go.; For once I totally agree with the voted rating here. 5.6 is spot on! Sandra B plays a computer whiz, altogether one sexy package, who offers a customised programming and data manipulation service to her clientele. What a shock then when we find she has taken one job too many...or rather the WRONG job. Before you can say \"Norton's Utilities\" she finds herself pretty much electronically \"erased\" and on the run from the law, her boyfriend (ultimately poor choice here!) and a really bad holiday! Although cliche'd and not much in the suspense or logic department, Bullock keeps the thing moving along - she is by far the best thing in it! Predictable and hammy ending don't exactly spoil it, because there never was anything much to spoil. A few decent keyboards on display, but little else. Jeremy Northam turns in an over the top performance as Sandra Bullock's lover-come-lately and the film's conclusion reeks of cinematic desperation. Not suited to multiple viewings unless one is very easily pleased! Intriguing!; I liked this movie very, very much. And it shows what happens when you become a victim of ID theft. You know who you are, but everyone doesn't. Angela Bennet(Sandra Bullock), is a big time computer geek who spends time on computers and pizza. Really doesn't give much anything else, until now. Sandra Bullock really puts on a show playing the strong will, smart and cunning character. Not only was Angela was the victim, other around and outside her were as well. Though she encountered some phonies along the way. Ruth Marx(Wendy Gazelle) really had everyone fooled except the real Bennet and me. If it wasn't for the infected disk, the fraudulent happening would have continued to spread like a plague. So far, the movie wasn't boring, it was filled intrigue, suspense, and most of all a fine ending. Everyone got what they wanted and so did I. Well done, Sandra Bullock! Rating 3 out of 5 stars! This Net Not Worth Getting Caught In.; The Net (1995): Dir: Irvin Winkler / Cast: Sandra Bullock, Jeremy Northam, Dennis Miller, Diane Baker, Ken Howard: Intriguing yet disappointing thriller about the Internet snare Sandra Bullock finds herself caught in. She gains access to a disc and encounters a peculiar guy while on vacation who seeks the disc. She makes her escape only to discover that she suddenly doesn't exist. She does a lot of running from danger to find out who is using her name and what the content on the disc is. Director Irvin Winkler does an effective job at creating Bullock's sudden world of paranoia. Bullock basically runs and makes narrow escapes. She could have out paced most marathon runners with the amount of running she does, and it effects the depth of the role, which slowly disintegrates. Jeremy Northam is cardboard as the sly villain. He talks the talk and gets blasted in the face with a fire extinguisher. He should be thankful considering how dull his dialogue was sounding coming from his mouth. Dennis Miller plays Bullock's only trusted friend who lands in trouble just for helping her. Or perhaps he landed in hot water for agreeing to do the film. Diane Baker also appears for all the good it does her. It is well made but it is unfortunate that the screenplay settles for tired thriller formula as oppose to examine the reality of identity theft. It teaches how easy one's identity can disappear as easy as the screenplay. Score: 4 / 10 mildly entertaining....; note:  some spoilers may be contained. the basic premise of this movie is that sandy bullock comes across some information she is not supposed to have, and spends two hours running from the bad guys. course, ole sandy has her demons...father ran off, mother suffering from memory loss...and pretty much keeps to herself.  so that bad guys (who have the power to break in to all these computers) just steal her identity. i read a comment that this was not a chick flick, but it VERY MUCH is.  the most all common element that draws it in are that all of the males in the film are either the bad guys OR are of no real help to the protagonist.  in my opinion, dennis miller has a pretty good role as her former lover/therapist who is the only person who can identify her, but he quickly gets offed. while it was mildly entertaining, the movie somewhat drug on and was just too predictable. Real TERROR of modern life.; Imagine, you put your informations in the internet and your life is ruined by the internet. Real TERROR of modern life. I love this movie very much because it presented us the fact that Internet has a dark side too. Our life turn up-side down by internet can happen in our real life.  Everything in this movie can be real. I think that this movie tried to warn The Internet Users all over the world to be careful about using Internet or else you will be like Sandra Bullock in this movie.  Her life (in this movie) is totally up-side down. Silly suspense; Made and released at the time when the internet was just becoming huge, this is a storyline Hitchcock would have loved. Sadly, Hitchcock wasn't around to make it, and we're left with an occasionally suspenseful but mostly silly thriller, that is held (barely) together by Bullock's intelligence. It was released in 1995 but is already dated, and the amount of mistakes and inaccuaracies regarding computers must be seen to be believed, and you don't even have to be a dot.com person to spot them! The prototypical two-and-a-half star movie; This movie must have been what critics were thinking of when they invented the two-and-a-half star rating. The writing is average, the direction is average, the suspense is average, and the acting (besides Sandra Bullock) is average. Bullock has seen her share of flops (\"Two If by Sea\", \"Speed 2\", and most recently, \"Practical Magic\") but she still manages to give consistently good, if not Oscar-worthy, performances. Besides that, the movie is, well...average. Web thriller on it's edge!; Pursued by an IT based terrorist to totally annihilate Angela Bennet(Sandra Bullock)in the world, she finds no one to relay her ordeal coz no one would going to believe such a story w/o anticipating the reality that connects user from the danger's of giving up personal information on the computerized system. A breath stopping chased ensued between Angela and her would be assassin played by(Jeremy Northam)and the chances of recovering her true identity from the Ruth Marx he shifted into her was dimmer w/o taking the risk of infiltrating the same software program w/c brought her to mess. Then in the end , she outsmarted the thugs raising the fact that no evil schemes could succeed good ones. Albeit I was little puzzled of how they over demonstrated the capability of computers, I can still brag that it was still a great movie compared to the flop, garbage cyber film,\"Hackers\".Thrilling portrayal of the web world is how I summed up this movie. Caught Like a Fish in the Net; This film deals with identity theft. Made nearly a decade ago, you might think it is outdated and irrelevant. WRONG! The topic is more relevant today than when it was made. The writing is ingenious and the acting is superb. Sandra Bullock is arguably better than she was in The Lake House, or even The Blind Side. I think this is one of her best works. The supporting actors are also good, but less memorable. I made popcorn to eat while watching, but found myself too mesmerized to begin chewing. The suspense is terrifying. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film. I never knew what would happen next. After watching, I can only hope I never find myself in a situation like this. Hopefully this film will help people realize the real threat of identity theft and be aware on how to prevent it. Two thumbs way, way up. It is, by far, one of the most thought out films of the decade. I tie my arm to be free-have you ever been free?; Unlike a box of cereal, a movie does not have contents, instead a movie has scenes and sequences. When I emptied out the contents of this cereal box of a movie, I looked upon a spread-out mass of meaningless pieces, not worth consuming. They made the movie too soon, like the studio heard back in 95 that the Internet might be a thing in the future, so they cobble together a feeble film under the premise that being first is always best, first internet movie! yeah! Generic thriller ham-fistedly rendered, lacking at all times suspense. Featuring a PG-13 rating so you know for certain nothing awesome will happen, no blood no tittie no cussing no violence. All of our schemes and machinations just to have sex with each other--it's all a big joke. Does Hollywood just not care anymore?; This is my first review, so go easy on me. I have to say that this is one of my all time Favorites. I think I watched this the first time when I was about 13 and not so long ago got my own Computer with Internet Access. I know how People say that there are a lot of Plot holes in this Movie, but I have to say I just don't see them. I am usually very picky and even small stuff gets me to complain. This movie actually does a very good Job at making this kind of Identity Theft even possible Today. Just imagine being able to search through every Database and change everything about a Persons life? Even if People would know them, for the System they don't exist or appear to be someone else and therefore just adding Identy theft to the list. You can already put it on there to make it more believable. That being written I would recommend this Movie to anyone who is even just slightly interested into Technology. It has a good pace and it actually gets me to think a little bit, which is more then I can say about more recent Movies. Sandra Bullock gives a believable performance even though some scenes are really just set up for her to look scared and disoriented, but in that Situation you would be too. Decent, if somewhat far-fetched thriller; The films protagonist; software engineer Angela Bennett, works from home; in fact she is such a recluse that she has never met any of her co-workers in person and doesn't even know her neighbours; her only contacts are the people she talks to on the internet and her mother who has Alzheimer's. One day a co-worker sends her a strange program that gives access to a new security program known as Gatekeeper; she agrees to meet him but he is killed when his plane's navigation system fails. She is shocked but thinks it was an accident so goes on her planned holiday to Mexico. Here she meets Jack Devlin; he appears to be the perfect man for her to spend time with as he shares so many of her interests; the problem is he just wants the disc with the program on and is 'perfect' because he has been talking to her on line. When he thinks he has the disc he intends to kill her but she manages to escape. This isn't the end of her troubles though; somebody has changed all computer records relating to her; when she gets home she finds her home is up for sale and her employers now have a new 'Angela Bennett' working in their offices; she is left with the identity 'Ruth Marx'; a wanted criminal. With her identity stolen she turns to the only man she can trust; Alan Champion her former psychiatrist and one time lover. Devlin is still trying to kill her; if she is to survive she is going to have to find out about a sinister group of hackers known as the Praetorians and how they are connected with Gatekeeper. In many ways this film feels quite dated and in many ways it is obviously far-fetched; if you can overlook these faults though it is a decent paranoid thriller with plenty of tense moments. Sandra Bullock did a fine job as the protagonist although I found it a little hard to believe that somebody as socially awkward as Angela Bennett would have worn THAT bikini... it did look good on her though! The rest of the cast were good enough although none of the other characters were really fleshed out. If you can suspend belief enough to accept that it might be possible to completely steal some ones identity the film as a nice streak of paranoia running through it; how would a person behave if nobody believed who they said they were any more? Over all I'd say this is far from being a classic but it was much better than I expected and is worth watching if you want a reasonable thriller. Sandra rocks!; This awesome, action-packed little gem, is one of my all-time favorite movies!! Sandra Bullock, once again, outdoes herself in this wicked film all about the Internet and the taking-over of people's lives. In 'The Net', Bullock stars as Angela Bennett, a computer-whizz, who while on holiday, encounters a dangerous man, who steals her wallet... and her life. Soon, the real Angela Bennett disappears, and an ex-con, takes on her identity, swapping her life for Angelas! Of course, Sandy isn't the type to take this kinda thing lying down - and all on her own, she fights hard to get back the life they took away from her. A wicked film - that'll leave you breathless for start to finish!! 9/10 Unrealistic; I don't understand why a woman so capable with the Internet would send and receive viruses via fed-ex-ed floppy disks as opposed to online. Hello, one of the things about being online is that every bit of information can be transported electronically. Did anyone else find this ridiculous?

Not Bad; I have to admit, I was only attracted to this movie due to the appearance of Jeremy Northam. After seeing him in \"Emma,\" I knew he was one of the greats. I didn't think he'd do well alongside Sandra Bullock, but I was proved completely wrong! They were dynamic. This movie is enough to hold you in your seat and then rocket you out of it. I've seen it three times, and still bite my nails for the last half hour of the film. The movie's pretty clean, so I think it's probably okay for most kids to watch (only a few bad words, and one scene where it's pretty obvious Jack and Angela made love; but it's not graphic and there's no nudity). All in all, I think it's a pretty cool movie. If you believe a man can fly then believe this; OK yes, the tech is old but it's my era tech. I loved the 3 and a half inch discs, I even liked the 5 inch floppies before those, not keen on the tape though, and I loved Castle Wolfenstien, first game where I beat the last boss, anyway la di da great movie. I watched to the end (That's always a good sign). Although I would liked to see the main villain Gregg get more than prison, a bit of torment as he realized the game was up, beaten by female geek no less. Sandra Bullock always does a good job in any acting role so it's worth a watch just see her doing her stuff (A very attractive girl also)(Can I say that?) so, definitely worth a watch, recommend. Oh, Mellisa Bones, nice job. A regular and engaging action movie with a storyline full of holes.; This film tells how a young computer technician sees her life stolen by hackers, who want to install an advanced computer hacking program on the computers of banks and state enterprises. Soon, she turns into a target, sought by the police, and arranges a way to stop the villains. It's a rather unreal story, full of holes but nice, creating a suspense that can hold us until the end. The pace is good and the short length also helps, there is no plot for a very long film. I especially liked Jeremy Northam, who gives us the main villain, a dangerous assassin in charge of stealing a disc that went to the hands of Angela (Bullock's character), and that tries to do it approaching romantically of her before revealing its face and trying to kill her. Sandra Bullock also played well, but we have seen this actress in several other similar characters. The rest is within the standards of a regular action movie of the nineties, so there is nothing more to point out here. Awful; What a miserable movie about the wonderful Internet. Sandy Bullock is for a sure a doll; I usually like all her movies but this one I could take for about an hour and off it went. A ridiculously confusing and impossible-to-believe story which was supposed to be \"Hitchcockian\" while turning out to be dumber than a Three Stooges reel. Good movie at that time; The Net seems to be a good movie at a time when the internet technology just took its pace off. Thus, it would've left people ignorant and puzzled when they hear terms used in the movie. Good entertainer though! Sandra Bullock's acting in the movie is good. The screenplay is good except in a few places where it could've been done much better. A scene where the guy updates the criminal record of Ruth Marx is far from reality. It makes people think that it was so easy to make anyone a criminal just by hacking up a server of the police department. And things like mainframe, I think it was not shown properly. A mainframe usually depicts the scene of huge servers in a room or its a remote session in a mainframe terminal. But sandra looks like she has been using a web user interface though which could've confused many audience. Caught Up in Its Own Absurdity; Futile Question revealing gross stupidity: 'Shark-fishing with a silencer?'' Cliché-ridden and dated, this movie has little to offer in terms of suspense, and, despite Bullock's charm, fails to live up to the attraction of the premise behind it. One can imagine that the pitch of a freelance computer analyst unmasking a conspiracy to control information on the internet, then becoming herself a victim of identity threat as the criminal organisation attempts to silence her, held great promise for the studio chiefs. However, the finished product contains too many flaws to deliver. The first issue, beyond the director and producers' control, is that the constant evolution of information technology underlines the inherent risk of focusing a plot so closely upon it. As a consequence, the grainy graphics on display, and outdated formats like the dependence on floppy discs, can so readily lose immediacy for current audiences. Moreover, the film suffers as any would in terms of pace by having to focus on what is happening on a computer monitor. As such, the screenplay opts for the lazy option of having Bullick's supposed computer genius constantly read out what she types. Yet, other deep-rooted plot deficiencies are far more harmful to the film's overall success. The narrative thread throughout requires the audience to suspend disbelief at how our heroine's gullibility, and random coincidence, trigger one chase scene after another. In returning to the first point, one only has to reflect on the risible reactions of our supposed gifted analyst upon discovering that the object of her holiday romance is a professional hit-man sent to eliminate her. Worse follows, with her seconds-long flight ended crashing into rocks large enough to be seen from another celestial body. Yet, of all the implausible scenes within the movie, this reviewer would give pride of place to our beleaguered and detained heroine choosing to make her one available phone call to establish her true identity to her mother, who it has already been established suffers from Alzheimer's. From evidence present here, it appears that the same writing team of Brancato and Ferris' later success with 'The Game', a remarkably similar screenplay of a stranded individual battling against identity threat, must owe much to the skills of the director of that project, David Fincher. Sadly, in this instance, director Irwin Winkler, much more adept at producing than helming, shares the fortunes of his writers' more customary run of disastrous releases. Another negative aspect concerns both the implausible ineptitude of Jeremy Northam's professional killer, and his own leaden performance in that role. This performance is ham-fisted enough without being further lain open to ridicule by Winkler's choice of a close-up on his villain's demonic stare to establish the threat he poses - a technique more akin to silent movies, and better executed by them. Equally as bereft of either acting ability or believability is the presence of Dennis Miller as our protagonist's ex-shrink and ex- lover cum stalker, Dr Alan Champion. So unappealing is his character that his demise at the hands of the cyber-criminals arraigned against our heroine is welcomed rather than evoking a sense of tragic loss. Overall, though this feature attempts to construct a Hitchcockian style suspense, it never rises above the lowest made- for-TV movie production levels. So-so thriller, silly computer graphics; This movie turned out to be an OK thriller, at least for me.  It really moves slowly in places.  And, yes, the computer graphics are of the \"Only In Hollywood\" variety.  Macintosh users:  our fave computer is used a lot throughout the movie(again, excuse the geeky, gimmicky graphics).  Also, look for a couple Photoshop filters to make cameos! My number 166 movie; You have read correctly. This is my number 166 movie. Sandra Bullock does a good job in this thriller, and she looks good. This is a film that you like , when you watch it 2 or 3 times. But the more you watch, the worse it gets. So I recommend watching this not more than 3 times. I rated this film 8/10, because it is a good thriller. exciting!; This was a good thriller where Sandra Bullock plays a computer expert who vacations in Mexico. While there, the bad guys distract her, steal her purse and wallet, trick her into signing a false visa, and use them to delete her identity on the internet. Fortunately, she is a computer expert and able fight back, and what follows is an exciting and tense chase throughout the next two hours. I will admit that this is predictable (what thriller isn't?), but it does have its moments and is tense throughout. The scary thing is that it could happen to you! Bullock gives a terrific performance, and overall I think this was an outstanding movie. Anyone who likes thrillers will like this one. *** out of **** Very good.; Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses, and she does a very good job, as usual.  The Net is suspenseful all the way through, and you are literally rooting for Sandra to kick the bad guys' bootwah!  And kick some bootwah she does do!  It had me on the edge of my seat in the theaters, and I immediately bought it when it came out on video.  A very good movie. Wait. . .what's this thing at the bottom right corner of my screen. . .maybe I should click it. . .No!  Don't click the thingy at the bottom right corner of the. . .!  **** out of *****. There are worse films.. but not many!; When I started watching it I did not know I was going to witness one of the worst movie experiences of my life. The movie is made in 1995 so in some way it is excused. But still, it tries to be high tech in a time period when high tech did not exist! The movie is so far of when it comes to what was possible back then. This was at the birth of Java, Internet as we know it, USB etc. but still not one part of the movie is believable. How someone can rate this film up to 7 or 8 is beyond my comprehension. They were either drunk, asleep during the film, keen on Bullock or were watching another movie. Because this movie is not worth more than maximum 3 stars. And that is just because of Sandra's black bikini. Im sorry Winkler, but you made a film that deserves to be on the Bottom 100 here on IMDb. And Im also sorry to all of you who are going to watch this film during your lifetime! A Common Man's Psychological Thriller; The Net (1995). It's hard to assess THE NET as a computer espionage thriller. It is less action than Enemy of the State (1998) and less poignant in some ways that War Games (1983), and not quite as intimately juvenile/teenager and smooth and polished as Antitrust (2001). In some ways The Net is a psychological thriller that depends more on the subtle, covert computer focus than most of the other movies in as such might be considered a much better, pure form of the this subgenre of computer-espionage thriller. There is the mother-daughter subtext as well as the rather powerful deception twist and the friendship and loss scenes that have some impact. Interestingly the climax seems long in coming and the frustration level quite high in this particular movie. Much of Sandra Bullock's behavior and action seem to be consistent and reasonable considering the circumstance she finds herself and fascinating in that she doesn't need to depend on extraordinary measures outside of her on-screen character which in some ways dampens the excitement of the movie but at the same time places it more in the human-reality context. The overall effect is to make the movie less captivating and yet in a strange way more compelling because of its connection to the Everyman. 7/10. mildly entertaining....; note:  some spoilers may be contained. the basic premise of this movie is that sandy bullock comes across some information she is not supposed to have, and spends two hours running from the bad guys. course, ole sandy has her demons...father ran off, mother suffering from memory loss...and pretty much keeps to herself.  so that bad guys (who have the power to break in to all these computers) just steal her identity. i read a comment that this was not a chick flick, but it VERY MUCH is.  the most all common element that draws it in are that all of the males in the film are either the bad guys OR are of no real help to the protagonist.  in my opinion, dennis miller has a pretty good role as her former lover/therapist who is the only person who can identify her, but he quickly gets offed. while it was mildly entertaining, the movie somewhat drug on and was just too predictable. Complete waste of time.; I see no reason to watch this film ever again. Actually I was only watching it for being curious about how much this movie could suck. Unfortunately it did suck big, big time! I am both a movie lover (with a relatively big collection of movies) and a computer geek (system analyst), so I believe I was able to watch the movie from more than just one viewpoint... I just wish they could have used some kind of networking/computer expert to help them out with the technical details and some able writers to avoid the problems they ran into with this movie, but it's always better to make some quick cash with a trendy subject, than making a movie with any historical value. The only good thing in this movie is sexy Sandra Bullock, who is one of my favorite actors. Unfortunately, a good actor can't save a crappy plot. Not even with help from a professional director like Winkler. It's quite obvious that the guys who put together this horrible screenplay had no idea of either computers or how to create some thrill... Naturally, in a movie based on playing around with computers, it's simply impossible to create any of the elements that make a good movie if you have no idea of what you are writing about. I voted 1/10, without Sandra it would have been -1 :P many complicated ways to kill people; Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) is a software beta test consultant. She's a homebody with few friends outside of cyberspace. She collects computer viruses for her friend Dale Hessman. She visits her mom (Diane Baker) in an old age home but she doesn't remember her. Dale sends her a program that seems to access unauthorized sites and then he's killed. She goes on vacation and meets Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam) who turns out to be a cold-hearted killer looking for the program. She barely escapes the attempt on her life and computers are going wrong giving her an alternate identity Ruth Marx. Her life is taken over by Devlin and she's pursued by the police. The only person she can turn to is Dr. Alan Champion (Dennis Miller) who actually knows her in real life. The question is why not just kill her. That seems to be the objective from before. Of course, he's trying to date her. If they want to know who she talked to, why not kidnap her? Torture is so much easier. Also why couldn't she make copies of the disk? Didn't she have access to the program in the hotel? There is a lot of stuff that is questionable even if the computer stuff is reasonable. The stuff surrounding the computer stuff makes little sense. Also the movie insists on killing people in the most complicated ways possible. And it seems like Bullock is always running in this movie. Most of the reviewers here must be born after 1990 or born before 1950; This was made in 1994-1995 at the beginning of the internet craze and the dot-com bubble, and this movie was wholly appropriate for the time era considering many people were just starting to get on the internet at this time. There are a lot of flaws in this film I agree, which is why I have rated it a 6, but my main complaint here is some of the reviewers on this site. Granted this movie was made at the beginning of the internet era, but some people on here make it sound like 1995 was back in the \"horse and buggy\" days. Either they were born after 1990 and don't remember a time without the internet or they are old as heck and were finally dragged down to the computer store just recently by their kids to get their very first computer. REALLY SCARY...AND IT'S NOT EVEN A HORROR FILM; My summary of this film says that it is scary. Why is it scary? Because the character Angela Bennett is alone, she doesn't have a clue what's going on and somebody else has control over her life. The great thing about this film is the fact that the enemy is initially unseen and not easy to beat. The enemy could be anyone...who can Angela Bennett trust? How much control does the enemy have over Angela Bennett? What does he/she/it/they want with her? I felt myself sympathizing with Sandra Bullock in this movie. If that type of situation were to happen to a person in real life then that person would be paranoid beyond belief and no doubt feeling despair. I love films like this where nothing is what it seems and you're never sure who is good and who is bad. Check it out. Worst bad guy in the history of cinema; I joined IMDb simply to review this movie. Specifically to review the bad guy. If you want the lowdown on the substance of the film go directly to other reviews rated 1 - they are very helpful and largely accurate. Jeremy Northam plays the brainbendingly badly written role of Jack Devlin. The acting wasn't bad per se but whoever wrote this stinker of a role (John D Brancato and Michael Ferris you know who you are) needs to go back to Movie Writing 101. Let me paint the picture. Jack Devlin is a smooth talking, handsome and incredibly IT savvy killer. He has a big boat, a gun and a way with words. Problem is he is comically hopeless at catching, much less killing his target - Angela Bennett played by Sandra Bullock. She is a socially inept computer programmer with no pretensions to know how to defend herself much less fight off a killer but spends the whole movie making Jack Devlin look like a first rate buffoon. Here is a summary of the \"killers\" incompetence: First encounter - Jack lures Angela Bennett to a remote location, constructs the theft of her personal belongings, kills a local low fi criminal, jumps on a boat, has a quick very personal physical encounter with a person he is apparently supposed to be killing (what the?) then leaves his gun in his jacket which Bennett puts on. She knocks him out and escapes. D'oh. Second encounter - Bennett's identity has been stolen. He tracks her down and is ready to pounce - except she steals a phone and runs away by sneaking out the toilet window - that old favourite. He follows her in his car but the IT geek gets away on foot. Third encounter - Jack Devlin sends a stooge, pretending to be an FBI agent to collect Bennett from the police station where she is being held. The plan works - except she sees through the ruse. After driving a long way from the cop shop she has been detained in she grabs the wheel of the car and crashes into - wait for it - Jack Devlin's car! Who wrote this stuff! It is diabolical. She gets away from the trained killer on foot again. Ba ha ha. Final encounter - Bennett breaks into a building to do some super mega sneaky IT stuff. Devlin and his accomplice track her down except Devlin jumps in to prevent her IT derring do and presses ESC on the keyboard. With all those IT skills Devlin believes he has smashed per puerile attempt to alert the authorities. But no. Bennett tricked him - he in fact destroyed the whole database that was the reason he was trying to kill her. Yes - by him pressing ESC. So the chase is on. Devlin shoots his female colleague dead. Then gets knocked cold with a fire extinguisher and plummets to his death. What a loser. The only people this \"killer\" killed was a Mexican hustler and his colleague. Despite having a gun and Bennett standing in front of him for about a third of the film he failed to lay a finger on her. Is Devlin the worst role written for a baddie in the movies. I believe the answer is yes. I commend this movie to that very hardcore minority of movie fans who can bear to watch a shocker of a film to find that rough diamond of abominable writing. Just focus on Devlin and you will be laughing from start to finish. The Movie that put me on the NET; A movie about a freelance computer systems analyst who's identity get's erased from the system, as Angela Bennett Sandra Bullock stumbles on conspiracy and corruption while de-bugging a game for a software company she works for. She then has to find how to get her identity back, in chases, fights and computer hacking. Sandra is excellent of course. Excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller; Wow! In my opinion, THE NET is an excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller that will leave you feeling good all over. When I first saw it, I was feeling good all over for days. When Angela (Sandra Bullock) went to Mexico, I thought to myself, \"That is a really nice place to vacation.\" From the moment Jack (Jermey Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) began chasing her, I thought to myself, \"Don't let anything bad happen to her! Please!\" I also took quite a few deep breaths to prevent myself from screaming any more than I already had. On the bright side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. In conclusion, I give this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller four stars. Complete waste of film stock.; I know, I should have learned by now, Hollywood can not be trusted to depict anything realistic involving computers and technology.  But when this movie is used in a class as an example of the Internet as a utopia or dystopia, you really need to question the professor's thinking. Sandra Bullock plays a computer nerd who beta-tests software for some company.  A co-worker, who collects computer viruses (uh, okay...), sends her an interesting example he found in one of their programs.  And of course, everything unravels from there.  \"Starring\" Dennis Miller as a therapist (who she visited, but presumably didn't get much out of the visits) and a bunch of other actors turning in similarly unremarkable performances. First off, this movie would lead one to believe that no one uses PC's (uh, right), since every single computer used is a Mac, even at the convention. At least the writers correctly predicted Macs would be running Unix (in a way).  But there are just so many plot holes and illogical actions that this movie is just a waste of almost two hours.  True, the plot holes aren't Final Destination bad, but they are still glaringly obvious.  It's like the writers took a stock conspiracy film and slapped a weak Internet plot on it. What is this crap?; This is where my boring adventure began. So the computers at my school were all being shut off all day because of some hackers. We spent TWO WHOLE DAYS in my technology class watching this crap on the screen. I decided to take out my iphone and listen to some music but the teacher said \"NO! Put that away and watch this amazing movie featuring Sandra Bullock\" The chick that was married to that one biker dude with all the tattoos and the one that made out with a girl? I gave it some thought and I actually enjoy old movies every now and then so I began to watch it. WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING?! This movie is junk. It's boring. Nobody is going to be entertained. If you want to see Sandra Bullock on a computer all day, making phone calls to 30 something people and making a huge fuss through out the entire movie, then this is the movie for you. The only part that I found entertaining is when she hangs out with some guy on a boat and some how he ends up being one of the bad guys and pulls out his gun and tries to shoot her. He should have so she can be put out of misery already. But anyways, this doesn't make any sense because she somehow manages to knock this guy out with random objects? He faints a couple times and she manages to escape and go to the boat that's next to her and leave. Then she awakens in some weird hospital place and then after this I kinda zoned out because I almost fell asleep. I told you the most entertaining part of the movie. Yes I understand the technology back then was OH MY GOD! She discovered how to order a pizza! Yaaaay! Big hype back in the day. Just don't watch. My teacher made a mistake, all the seniors and juniors in the class looked so out of it. It was the most boring period of my life. Watch something better. This is a comedy for the true Hackers; I will admit, I liked this movie when I was a teenager, mainly because the movie involved computers. But over the years, I have quickly come to realize that this movie is really nothing more than a silly fiction story. First of all, for this exact reason, the government would never ask a single company to knowingly setup something linking all of the government's computer systems. But probably the most comical part of this movie is how everyone says \"our computers are protected by the Gatekeeper System, so it's not possible that anyone could have broke in to change anything.\" Anyone with a reasonable amount of knowledge in the computer industry will tell you that there is no such thing as absolute security. And frequently, finding ways around a security system can be a lot easier than anyone would ever like to think. I also love the end of this movie, where she unleashes the virus on the Gatekeeper System (their obviously unsecured key to absolute security), and they say \"the virus is eating through the Gatekeeper System, nothing will be left, everything will be destroyed!\" All she did was stick the disk in the computer, and it instantly infects the Gatekeeper system, waiting for them to press Esc. By the way, I thought Mac's were supposed to be immune to viruses. LOL I find it interesting how our society becomes more and more attached to technology, yet the people using it seem to become more and more clueless. From what I've seen, the only movie about computers that ever made reasonable sense was made more than two decades earlier... \"WarGames\" The Net; Now this was a blast from the past, my teenage years (I was 17 at the time). It might seem crazy these days but I distinctly remember watching this in the cinema with a friend, and both of us scoffing at how ridiculous the movies premise was. The whole idea of the internet (something that was more of a joke back then) being able to bring down someone's entire life. The idea of people actually having portable computers and being able to use them, online! everywhere! The idea of someone's life revolving around a computer...or more specifically the net, was at the time almost inconceivable (unless you were rich). Yes these were simpler times my friends, back before the internet was an integral part of people's lives, or before the internet was even taken seriously. Hell back then movies like this were the only introduction some people had to the, so called, information highway. This and movies like 'The Lawnmower Man' were pretty much the only things most common people saw of the internet, hence why we all thought it was a gimmicky flash in the pan. Even British videogames TV show 'GamesMaster' would mock the internet with its limited abilities at the time. We were told one day we'd all be surfing the net, we all ridiculed the notion, how wrong we were. Anyway the movie. Systems analyst Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) is accidentally drawn into the dark world of cyber terrorism when her work college sends her sensitive information on a floppy disk (remember those?!). The information revolves around the death of the US Secretary of Defense and a large software company CEO, Jeff Gregg. Whilst on holiday Bennett gets wined and dined by mysterious British gent Jack Devlin whom she starts to have feelings for. But before she knows it this British gent is trying to kill her so he can get his hands on this disk. Following a nasty accident where Bennett tries to escape Devlin, she awakes in hospital to discover her life has been deleted. Bennett must now try and find help to recover her life, evade Devlin, and uncover the truth on the disk. Yeah so the plot is your typical computer hacking/expert, on the run type affair which is now a dated concept. This idea was quite new at the time but director Irwin Winkler really tapped into the public's interest by utilising the newfangled internet contraption. The internet wasn't unheard of at the time of course, but it was intriguing to the masses and was used a lot to present an exciting new angle to movies. It was almost like an unexplored universe and Hollywood wasn't gonna let it slip by without milking its every potential. The other main draw for this movie was actress Sandra Bullock who was literally the biggest thing in Hollywood between 1993 - 1995. Hot off a trilogy of blockbusting hits that were 'Demolition Man', 'Speed' and 'While You Were Sleeping', Bullock could do no wrong. She was America's sweetheart with her adorable, girl next door looks and squeaky clean image. People just went to movies starring Bullock, no questions asked, she was huge. This movie also used the highly unpopular nerd image which was still something to mock at the time. Nowadays nerds are all the rage but back in the day oh no, being a nerd was not cool. But what baffled people even more was the introduction to a sexy female nerd, this was virtually unheard of at the time. This did present a problem for the movie simply because no one believed a sexy female could be a whizz- kid on computers or a nerd. Especially Bullock who was Hollywood's new darling leading lady. And admittedly it is hard to believe Bullock in this role because she simply doesn't look like she understands what shes talking about half the time. She also looks surprisingly unathletic considering her previous action movies, she kinda sleepwalks through this looking bored. Looking back now this movie is fun simply to see all the retro hardware and early programs in action. All these chunky laptops, very basic net page layouts, disk swapping and loading etc...it does bring back many memories. The action is kinda sparse but reasonably thrilling I suppose, it was never gonna be a violent movie with Bullock in the lead. Bullock was the queen of PG-13/12 rated movies. So the movie cuts away for any violence and there is little profanity, if any. Jeremy Northam is easily the best thing about the film with his devilishly charming contract killer, probably why his character is called Devlin. In the end this is a very safe and harmless action thriller that didn't want to rock the boat for its leading lady. Bullock is still cute and cuddly while under the stress of being hunted down by a hit-man. Being a movie about computers director Winkler obviously couldn't pass up a chance to film at the Macworld/iWorld trade show in San Francisco. So naturally the tense unrealistic finale is shot there. It is hilarious to watch Bennett downloading/uploading such large chunks of data onto floppy disks just in the nick of time. I'm just gonna assume that the trade show would have had the best of the best computers on show so that made it possible. Its all very silly, cutesy and charming these days, so amusing to think this was a big serious release back in the day. 5.5/10 TV show is better; Maybe it didn't help that I saw the TV show first when that came out in 1998, but over all, I think the show was better than the movie. Sure Sandra Bullock is a great actress, but I think she's better in other movies myself. The movie lacked the show's closeness with all the characters, the good guys and the bad guys. We never really got to know anyone up close, not even Angela, which made it kind of hard to understand. It also seemed to jump around a lot, from one place to another without connecting anything. Over all, I think they could have done a much better job, taking out half the characters that were supposedly on her side, which ended up dead before the movie was half over. It was a good movie to some degree, but it required a lot of help, to make it even better. In the end, if you can, watch the TV show instead. You give us the disk and we'll give you your life back!; ***SPOILERS*** Quick paced thriller involving computer analyst Angela Bennett, Sandra Bullock, who unknowingly got her hands on this mysterious floppy disk that she was testing for a computer virus. The disk's information can put an end to the dreams of multi-billionaire founder of the \"Gatekeeper Security System\" Jeff Grege, Gerald Berns. Grege has been trying to get the US Defense Department-the Pentagon-to install his system but Defense Secretary Michael Bergstrom, Ken Howard, was dead set against it. With Grege using the \"Gatekeeper\" to hack into Bergstrom's medical records it falsified them stating that he's suffering from an advance and fatal case of AIDS! This had Bergstrom, whom were told was homophobic, in knowing that he doesn't have long to live go out into a nearby D.C park and blow his brains out. With Bergstrom's replacement Calvin Shoemaker now running the show-Defense Department-the \"Gatekeeper\" is a given but as usual-in computer science- there's a glitz: The geeky and shut-in computer analyst Angela Bennett! Actually Angela got the explosive, that revealed the true nature of the \"Gatekeeper System\", disk from her on-line contact, and fellow computer nerd, Dale Hessman, Ray McKinnon. It was Dale's misfortune to get himself killed in a suspicious plane crash just before he was to get the disk-from Angela-back. With her now in possession of the \"Gatekeeper\" disk Angela's life was turned into a living hell for knowing its contents. On the run from the police and hit-man Jack Devlin, Jeremy Northam, who's working for the \"Gatekeeper Project\" Angela in her choosing to be locked up in her her home, as a computer expert, for some six years has no one who can vouch for her identity as Angela Bennett! Having all her personal belongings stolen-by Devlin-on a trip to Mexico,her first vacation in six years, Angela has been given the bogus identity, by those out to get her, of Ruth Marx a convicted felon! With the police as well as hit-man Devlin on her tail Angela has to prove who she is and at the same time convince the authorities, both federal as well as sate, what Jeff Grege is planning to do. Disrupt the entire US economic and transportation systems with his \"Gatekeeper Project\" and at the same time prevent, by having it installed in the Pentagon, his evil plan from being uncovered! ****SPOILERS**** The movie \"The Net\" was made in early 1995 years before the internet became known, as well as available, to most of those watching it at the time of its release. Despite its very confusing storyline and almost inconceivable climax with the release, by Angela, of a super computer virus the film is still fascinating, now with the internet a major factor in everyone's lives, to watch. We can see how ahead of its time \"The Net\" was in bringing out back then in 1995 which was considered science fiction to what became, engineered computer economic crimes and identity theft, science fact just a few years later!   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        A good laugh; This short animation tells the story of Scrat who loves his nut, and does everything to protect the nut. This time, he is in a spaceship trying to save his nut from zero gravity situation. However, he accidentally activates the spaceship and the numerous unbelievable functions, causing chaos in space. This is further complicated by aliens showing up to snatch his nut. The first half of the animation is very familiar to me, as I watched it in the new \"Ice Age\". The second half has new scenes which are quite funny. Though each time I keep thinking that the idea of Scrat and his nut is getting very old and beaten, I still get a laugh every time I watch it. Scrat, the adorable saber-toothed squirrel; First of all, loved it! Yet another Scrat adventure and it was awesome. Causing chaos left and right only for trying to hold on to his beloved acorn. I am a big animation fan and I enjoy Ice age, but it would not be the same without Scrat. Not because he is somewhat the driver of the story line (in my opinion) but because he is hilarious to watch and can only be praised for his effort trying to achieve the impossible over and over again. And for those who like Ice Age and love Scrat, watching all his shorts in one go is like watching a Scrat movie and I hope they will continue this until they run out of ideas for Ice Age. Great animation and a lot of laughs from start to finish. This should be called Scrat: F*ck Out; ¿A 14 Mini Movie minute about Scrat? How stupid can be. This is not a Mini Movie, is a clip comparison of ALL THE SCENES OF SCRAT of Ice Age: Collision Course. Including some deleted scenes animated. Scrat: F*ck Out (Oh, i'm sorry, \"Scrat: Spaced Out\"), i'ts nothing that 14 minutes waste of time. Not a single joke was funny, the story is stupid and Scrat as a character is unfunny and disappointing. Yes, the animation is good ¿And what?. This is more \"Ice Age: Without the heard\". It doesn't need your Attention. This is the must unfunny and unoriginal animated short of Scrat I ever seen. If your a fan, just don't watched. Just kill the franchise now. 3/10 Scrat as usual, just longer and in space; \"Scrat: Spaced Out\" is a 2016 animated short film and as such the newest addition to the \"Ice Age\" franchise. Many Scrat short films exist and most of these are really short, but this one here runs for a \"massive\" 15 minutes which is unusual for the films about this character. I guess they still keep making these because of the success (Oscar-nominated) of the early ones. Yeah well, there is not a lot more to say. There was another Scrat short film from last year when he is in space and this new Ice Age full feature film (which was actually very weak) has a connection to space and meteors as well, so this subject seems to be really en vogue for the franchise here. But back to this Scratventure (oh yes I did!). The title character is basically flying through space, sometimes in a capsule, sometimes outside and tries to get a hand on his acorn as always. And as if Scrat was not struggling enough already with natural aspects, he also has to deal with a bunch of supernatural alien creatures (that look like Scrat in other color, female and in space suits). I must say the only funny scene in here was probably the one that involved the other Ice Age characters in a solid little reference. Other than that, I was neither impressed nor entertained, but then again i have never been a really big Scrat fan. His films jumped the shark a long time ago if you ask me, if they even made it up the shark to be honest. I don't recommend this newest films. Thumbs-down.   \n",
