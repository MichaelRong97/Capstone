       "      <td>Best Film of the 90's!; That film has made its first success with the most beloved buddy picture of all time! The Next Who Framed Roger Rabbit I love how they try to make something different with CGI, because all they've done in the beginning were commercials and shorts. Ever since John Lasseter saw Tron, he knew that CGI would go all over the place. And boy has Pixar nailed it! The Story has taken itself to a whole new level, it's all about getting back to a young boy by using the power of teamwork, accepting for what you are, and telling the truth in an innocent way. Woody never meant to hurt Buzz, he just wanted to spend his life with Andy. The other toys are blinded by this accident that they decide to toss their leader out like garbage. Sid is what I believe the best villain for three reasons 1.He's the bully for the toys 2.He's stuck in the mind of a mad doctor or scientist 3.He learns an important lesson that toys are meant to be in heaven, not in toy hell. Unless you're a Losto Bear who thinks that humans are the enemies. Man! This is the reason why people loved the 90's. There was a time when animation wanted to push itself to next level. And Toy Story was one the important examples of being the greatest survivors with a lovely story, fresh start animation, amazing characters, and epic songs by Randy Newman. This could be a fresh start for those who wanna tell stories. In fact I have novel that I'm working on. It's on my Watpadd. Check it out https://www.wattpad.com/story/37790294-meme-world Toys, a symbol of our childhood; This film tells a story of rivalry between two toys: a cowboy doll named Woody and an action figure named Buzz Lightyear. They will fight for the affection of a child from the moment that Buzz is offered to him as a gift, threatening Woody's place as his favorite toy. A rivalry that will lead to a strong friendship between them. Directed by John Lasseter, one of the brightest minds of Pixar Studios, the film features the voices of Tom Hanks (as Woody) and Tim Allen (as Buzz) for the main characters. This was the film that launched Pixar to success, in a journey that still goes and deserves the respect of all admirers of the seventh art. The story of this film is deeply moving, not only to focus on strong themes like loyalty and friendship but, mainly, because it mess with our fondest memories by involving toys that we all played when we were kids. Its not a coincidence that we see, in this film, toys of our parents and grandparents living with action figures and games of our time. This film tries to touch everyone, from the small audience to the adults who take them to the movies. It's a great movie for the family and it's still current today, twenty years after his premiere. great job; this movie was such a great family movie. My daughter absolutely loves all the toy story movies we watched every single one of them and it always gets to us. great job to the creator of the movie. I loved how my daughter reacts to the movie when her favorite part comes up. I think she seen this movie so many times she probably knows the lines already. Woody is such an awesome cowboys i think he is one of my favorite characters along with little Bo-peep and slinky. Every toy in that movie make a really good team. I thought it was mean that woody pushed buzz out the window because he was a jealous toy. But I'm glad him and buzz get along great. one of the best animated; In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present, a group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy Davis (John Morris), are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his single mother (Laurie Metcalf) and infant sister Molly are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess (Annie Potts), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex the Dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberger) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge (R. Lee Ermey), spy on the party and report the results to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift  an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who believes that he is an actual space ranger. Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie; I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about. Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys. The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys. Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film. toys are alive; ****spoiler***** All of children have some toys, for example, baby dole, teddy bear, gun and so on, but everyone doesn't think that the toys able to move, speak and have their live. If it was true, it is a little scared, but it is so interesting to image their living. But in this movie, it seem that the toys don't know that they are made by someone at first. The setting is so interesting, When BUZZ he is a new toy of his master knows that he is not a real hero, he is so depressed because he had lost his identity. But the lead character, WOODY, helps him, even if he is hated by his friends. The time when BUZZ accepts his real potential and gets over a trial with WOODY makes us exciting and it makes us forget that they are toys sometimes. This is the first successful film which is the CG animation for Disney films and the anecdote of STEVE JOBS and JOHN ALAN LASSETER will not disappear forever. Great fun, a film that's not just for kids; I wasn't too sure about this film before I watched it. The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story. The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up  something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space! Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home. Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is 6 years old, but I've only just seen it!). The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others  such as Mr. Potato Head  are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep  who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries! The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back. Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible. The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films  particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations. All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again. And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them? Well, now we know why! The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in 1937 lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Fantastic animated movie for all ages.; Toy Story is a fantastic animated movie for all ages. The movies stars toys brought to life and their tiny adventures. Full of thrill, comedy and charm. Even though the computer graphics are starting to get a bit dated, it's incredibly fascinating seeing Pixars humble beginnings. This is the movie that laid the groundwork for their continued successes. The movie stars Tim Allan as Buzz Lightyear, Tom Hanks as Woody, just to name a few of the talented actors that have loaned their voices to this instant classic. I highly recommended this movie to anyone looking for a good time. Pixar's overall #1 best, one of the best parts of my childhood, overall best animated film, and one of the best films in general as well; Toy Story is the very first animated film ever made in history, it's the overall best and set the bar high for plenty of future computer animated films in general for a lot of good reasons. Pixar's first film takes place in a world where toys come alive when nobody is around, the story centers around a pull string cowboy doll named Woody who's voiced by Tom Hanks, he's the favorite toy of a young boy named Andy, but that changes when Andy gets a new action figure for his birthday, that particular toy is Buzz Lightyear who is voiced by Tim Allen, Buzz wins all the attention which makes Woody inevitably jealous and forces him to try to get rid of Buzz, resulting in them getting separated from Andy, therefore, they must put their differences aside and try to get back to Andy before him and his family move to their new house. With great writers like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, and Joss Whedon, the story as a whole needs nothing more and nothing less, it's just right, every scene advances the story forward. The characters are all memorable, the Pizza Planet aliens, the cowardly Rex voiced by Wallace Shawn, the know-it-all Hamm the piggy bank voiced by John Ratzenberger, the loyal Slinky-Dog voiced by Jim Varney, and the sassy and rude but always hilarious Mr. Potato-Head who's voiced by Don Rickles. But the best characters are the two main protagonists, Buzz Lightyear is a character that took a life of his own and became a pop-cultural phenomenon over night, even getting his own TV show, in fact in December 1995 every child on the planet wanted a Buzz Lightyear action figure, which is what Buzz represents the toy we all wanted when we were kids but weren't lucky enough to get, the ultimate action hero of the ultimate hero, and on top of all that casting Tim Allen to do his voice is by far one the best voice over performances of all time. Then there's Woody, Tom Hanks' performance as the sheriff of these parts was outrageously flawless, he's an old soul and his case is quite literal, considering he is a toy from the early generation which we didn't grow up in, but he is probably the character we can relate to the most. As for the best scene, the end of the final chase scene when Buzz and Woody are flying through the air after almost being blown up by a rocket: Woody: Hey Buzz you're flying! Buzz: this isn't flying, this is falling with style! Where Buzz finally achieves what he knew he could do from the start and Woody can put his doubts aside. Get the family together and get ready to go as Buzz and Woody put it \"TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!\"  This movie was one of the best 3d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an 8.5.(I gave it an 8) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of 3d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! G.o.a.t; I loved this film. For me, this is the best animated movie of all time. I think the story is very heartfelt and captures the relationship between a young boy and his toys really well. It has a universal message that applies to all ages: love. I think they did a great job with the range of characters, too; Each one brings a different perspective/attitude that really crosses over into real life whilst maintaining true to their toy-personality. This movie has good elements of comedy and drama, good guys/bad guys, heroes and aliens. It is a feel-good, timeless movie that will be relevant for generations to come. Good, Creative charm for kids and adults!; I'm not a huge fan of animated films, so coming into Toy Story I had very low expectations. At first, I thought it was Meh. Then, as the movie progressed it got better and better. Buzz is funny, Woody is a good cowboy, Sid is awesomely evil. Toy Story has an amazing cast as well. I mean, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, AND the Amazing Don RICKLES as Mr. Potato Head! Toy Story keeps kids and adults on their feet and I'm praising it so much because I have never seen any ANIMATED film as good as Toy Story so far. Disney really worked their magic into this classic. Toy Story FTW. I'm going to go rent Toy Story 2, and see if this film series has advanced even further. The one that started it all; In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In 1995, they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be 100% made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history. The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having \"souls\" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was. Rating: 9,5/10 Best Kids Movie of All-Time; When ever I here someone hating on this movie I cant believe it. What is not to like about this movie? It is a story about realizing who your true friends are in times of trouble and learning to live with what you are. This movie is something not only kids will like but their parents will love it too. I know for a while my mom liked this movie more than I did. Tom Hanks was perfect for the role of Woody and his paranoid attitude is what makes the movie what it is (morally). Change is a good thing and this movie changed everything. Even though the graphics are obviously outdated everything still works as well as it did almost 20 years ago! and Im feeling old.... But it is a must see for anyone i would love to buy this movie but i cannot find it anywhere, that says something. Hanks and Allen are hilarious even animated!; As if Tom Hanks wasn't talented enough...someone had the brilliant idea to animate him! Not to mention pair Hanks great sense of humor with comedic genius Tim Allen! Together, these two keep the giggles and laughs coming in this cute and successful Disney Pixar flick that spawned an even cuter sequal! Pixar's first full length movie.; This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back 10 years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies. Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only 7 when I first watched it in theaters). The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like \"Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc.\" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him. Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a \"Buzz Lightyear\" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys. Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more. I give it an 8/10 perfect movie for the whole family to watch. One Of The Great Animated Features Of The 1990's!; If you love Toy Story 2, then, you'll love this original classic!!! The first Disney/Pixar production (And, the first animated feature to be computer made) is well worth a double feature with Toy Story 2-of course! If A Bug's Life can knock Antz and The Prince Of Egypt out of the minds of moviegoers, Toy Story have no rivals to forget! One of a kind! - the first computer-animated film and a touching story of friendship; This movie is just awesome! Bearing in mind that this was a film from 1994/95, the quality of the realistic 3D animation is stunning and what a perfect way to start a new era! Just as a new form of animation comes to life, a vast number of toys magically come to life when their child-owner Andy is out of the room. Maybe that's a true-to-life symbolisation! From the word go, every single one of those toys have become so famous and iconic. Argos (especially), Toys R Us, Amazon, Woolworths and more have never, since the film's 1995-release, been without stock of them! Like it says in the summary, it's a heart-warming story as well as a funny, super-cool movie about a pull-string ragdoll (Woody) whose popularity is short-lived as Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday as a result of new electronic toys hitting the market proving to be better than a just a ragdoll. Understandably, Woody is jealous of Buzz and can't stand his guts. He's an arrogant, self-interested toy but, more than anything else, an total, utter idiot. All the toys have their own personalities; there's Little Bo Peep who has a soft spot for Woody, Slinky Dog who likes Woody and is very friendly, Rex the world's most IRRITATING dinosaur ever, RC, the RC who revs up and down rather than talks and then there's Mr Potato Head and he is VILE! So, so mean and frequently rude. He seems to have some kind of vendetta against Woody for no reason I can think of. Then, he creates his very own campaign to destroy Woody in order to avenge Buzz when Woody's the one who has felt lonely and unwanted for so long! You'd think it'd put children off the authentic Mr Potato Head by Playskool! Oh yes and there's one more toy I didn't mention - Lenny, the toy-sized pair of binoculars. He was voiced by Joe Ranft who contributed in the story development of \"Toy Story\" and is now sadly no longer on this earth. He was killed when the speed of his car went beyond control, crashed through the wall of a bridge and plunged into the river below. The Pixar team miss him terribly... JOE RANFT 1960-2005 The one that started it all; Toy Story will forever be remembered as the first feature film to be fully animated by computer. Since its debut in 1995, dozens more have joined it, including a sequel (soon to be two sequels as of this writing), as well as several other excellent films from its animation company, Pixar. However, for its unique accomplishment, Toy Story stands alone. It doesn't hurt that even beyond the technical achievement, the film is charming, well-written, and touching. The toys in question belong to Andy, who has a huge variety of them scattered around his room. The unofficial head toy is Woody, a cowboy toy who has \"been Andy's favorite since kindergarten\". Woody loves being the favored toy, but the order is shaken up when Andy receives a surprise present on his birthday: a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who causes Woody to become jealous when he begins to take over the #1 toy position in Andy's playtime. There's a lot of good stuff in this film: The animation, which mostly still works 15 years later; the voice acting, which is carried out excellently; the story, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. What gets me most about Toy Story is the way that both Woody and Buzz must grow throughout the movie. Woody has to let go of his jealousy and accept that things change when someone new enters the mix. Buzz has to learn (the hard way) that he really is a toy, but that he has a very important role as such. This is better character development than we see in some \"more mature\" films. It was here that Pixar began a long line of memorable, excellently crafted characters. Pixar has released ten feature films in the past fifteen years. Toy Story 3 this summer will make eleven. They've maintained a very high standard of quality during that time. It definitely helps that, with Toy Story, they were off to an excellent start. First Pixar Film, Did Amazing; I Recentely Re-Watched Toy Story And I Think That Every Time I Watch This Film, It Gets Better. This Is Basically The Plot. Sheriff Toy Is Jealous When A New, Cooler Toy Named Buzz Lightyear Came And Changed The Sheriff. Then The Sheriff And The Space Ranger Are Proceeded To Be Tortured By A Toy-Torturer Named Sid, A Boy Who Loves Giving Pain To All Toys. I Think That This Film Is One of, If Not, One of The Best 3D Animated Movies EVER. Some Scenes Give You The Feels, Some Get You Into The Movie. Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) Was A Masterpiece In This First Installment of The Toy Story Trilogy. Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) Was Completely Enthusiastic In This Movie. I Think Most People Think Sid Is A Toy Serial Killer. I Agree. Sid Is Completely At It With Giving His 'Pain Surgery' To Fellow Toys Who Were Tormented By His Schemes. This Movie Has A Great Plot, Gives Character Development, Chose Great Actors That Overall, Enjoyed Their Parts! This Deserves At Least A 9/10 For An Outstanding 3D Animated Movie In 1995. It's a Happy Movie! Ya there's spoilers; I put this computer animated movie just on the cusp of being great. You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time...8.7/10 This DVD is part of the Toy Story 2 Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages. Quality animation always looks good on the big screen and this looks wonderful. This is a Buy and Hold to flesh out your collection to include 'Happy Movies' as my daughter puts it. The DVD is a solid 9/10 Awesome; A very sweet and fun movie. TOY STORY has great computer animation. A simple yet well told story is also added as well. The voice overs are top notch and everyone gets a fair share in this movie. PIXAR has done a good job placing itself on the map. Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle. Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel. A good rent. On it's 20th Birthday, Toy Story still soars To Infinity and Beyond!; In 1989, Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help. They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as \"Toy Story\", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about. First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the \"I'm Mrs Nesbitt\" sequence and the \"You Are A Toy\" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies \"You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic \"To Infinity and Beyond\" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history. There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's 81 minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" and \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" hit the right notes by being memorable songs. Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school. Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late 2000s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy 20th Birthday. Classic!; \"Toy Story\" is one of the best animated films ever created! The movie is about Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) hating each other like no other. Buzz accidently fell out of the window and Woody is accused by all the other toys of having killed him. He has to go look for him outside so they can return to Andy's room. But they got into trouble by a toy torturer while trying to get home. \"Toy Story\" is a must-see for everybody who likes Disney and it is for all ages to watch! Followed by an amazing sequel! 10/10 stars!</td>\n",

       "      <td>A great movie for All ages!; Jumanji! based on the story's by Chris Van Allsburg Robin Williams is a blast! The effects were groundbreaking. The movie itself is highly original. What are you waiting for! if you haven't seen this, be ready for some quality family time! why an 8? Because it is simply fun and entertaining. Sure it is not a perfect movie , but this is what a movie is supposed to be. i am SHOCKED by the low rating!!! 6.5 really?, Unlike dark knight or inception, which are awful in every way, this is actually entertaining and fun. A little creepy for the faint of heart... \"kids\" but they will survive! this is in a world of its own!!!!! and it deserves far more then the 6.5 it receives id like to see it reaching a 7.5 for entertainment value only! not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late 1960s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is 1969, and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats. 26 years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good! Stupid, but fun, family adventure; Board games aren't as popular as they used to be. Before the likes of Xbox and Facebook, we had classic board games such as Go For Broke and Game Of Life. Luckily, we didn't have anything like Jumanji; a mystical board game which magically comes to life as you're playing. It sounds incredibly fun, which is what young Alan Parrish thinks, minutes before he is sucked into the game and left to fend for himself for 30 years. Reawakened by a younger generation, old Alan, played by the late Robin Williams, must finish the game before it engulfs the entire town. If it sounds a little ridiculous, that's because it is. But it is a heck of a lot of fun as well. Robin Williams brings his usual maniacal charm and injects healthy doses of humour when the movie threatens to take itself too seriously and a young Kirsten Dunst offers ample support as one of the younger players. But the real star of the show is the effects; we are treated to scenes of an animal stampede through the streets, a monsoon inside a huge mansion and, in a wonderful subplot, one of the players is gradually transformed into a monkey because he tries to cheat the game. It is almost 20 years old now so, understandably, some of the effects don't quite hold up, with the monkeys being the prime example but the premise is so much fun that you won't really mind a few dodgy effects shots here or there. It also takes a little while to find its feet, with the beginning seeming to drag on for a little longer than necessary, and the ending may be a little to sickly sweet for some tastes. But once the main plot gets going it barely stops for breath as the players have to deal with any threat that the game delivers and a big part of the fun is waiting to see what the game will spit out next. A wonderfully fun family film with plenty of thrills and a great premise. Not for 13+ age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for 1980 not for 1995. Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. review for jumanji.; This 1995 film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game 26 years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are 8+ as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than 8 and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. IT's the most great movie EVER, you can't get Enough of it; I want to give this movie what it really deserve ,If i will say there is movie that i will never forget in my life ,it will be this great movie for the brilliant actor robin Williams. first of all, I want to thanks all the cast of this movie and the great director ,for bringing it to us. when I want to be refresh and happy and laugh I will watch it when I want to feel the power of love and the thriller of adventure, I will watch it , there are a lot of people how see it as for children only but its really not , it was like they know where to start and finish. this movie is for everyone its my best movie ever I give it 10%10 don't miss it original, not like any other game; I saw this when I was 9, and I was obsessed with it and saw it 3 times in the theater, and it was my favorite movie. The whole idea of slight, unhappy, 12-year-old Alan Parrsih (Adam Hann-Byrd-Little man Tate, Halloween H:20) getting trapped in a board game in 1969, for 26-years and coming back as a grown man. The idea was unforgettable to my interest in time, and I imagined my self then coming back 35-years old. The movie is so elaborate and original, the stampede was always my favorite, it's got such edge-of-year seat action with the Rhinos, Elephants, and Zebras crashing throught the wall at the last second, and they used the most dangerous animals possible. Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) ALan's childhood friend, and Peter (Bradley Pierce) and Judy (Kirsten Dunst, along with Alan play the game and bring Gian mosquitos, vines and a Hunter from the game. The movies also really funny especially the cop. Robin Williams Best Film; Robin Williams is a great actor who has made some great films over the years but I think Jumanji is the best. I mean, what more could you possibly ask for? It's a great idea-as a child I would have loved a board-game like that. It's certainly a very gripping movie throughout-the more the players get involved the worse things become. Before you know it elephant's and rhino's are on the loose trashing a town and there's a mad hunter lurking around too. This is one of those films which you can watch again and again and still enjoy. I recommend it highly-it has a great plot, great acting and some great scenes. Watch out for the scene with the male lion on the bed.  Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... Great fun; Robin Williams is in his element as an adult/child and with wonderful support from Kirsten Dunst, Ian Richardson playing the Englishman hunter and sending himself up nicely, the excellent children and others make this escapist adventure at it's best. Til the dice read five or eight \n",
       " Jumanji; Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in 1995, I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 1800's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in 1969, transporting him into the jungle world for 26 years until two new children stumble upon its drumming. Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time \n",
       " well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects. The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be \"real\", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end. The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still childrenone had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow upand with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think. There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as \"Soulman\" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the \"adult\" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal. good original family movie; Joe Johnston's Jumanji is very good family movie that is well paced. The movie is the story of a mysterious game that involves it's players more than the normal board game. The movie begins with a young boy, Alan Parrish, finding the abandoned game. He talks the girl he has a crush on, Sarah Whittle, into playing with him. Once the game starts, chaos ensues. Robin Williams carries this movie, giving it life. The other actors do okay with the bare dialogue. Joe Johnston uses the experiences on the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies to craft a fantasy world that is believable. Though not outstanding in any way, Jumanji is a fun movie that should delight children with its action and fantasy. 6 out of 10 stars. Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for 25(?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\" Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a 10/10. My first childhood film and one of my all time favorites!; I was born in 1994 so I am one year older than but my Uncle bought a copy of Jumanji when I was in pre-school and the whole family watched it together. And after seeing the film for the first time, the story is just like a funny adventure to me and I really love it. I always sneak up to the CD cabinet to watch it again because my grandmother always gone mad every time I switch the CD player and the television. And after a several replays, the movie grown deeper to me; the message of the film and everything. Until now, I still watch the movie and still having lots of laugh. A Great Family Entertainer!; Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid &amp; I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism &amp; magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh &amp; Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining &amp; magical. It offers humor, magic &amp; emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography &amp; Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd &amp; Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up! Jumanji Review; Jumanji is a film directed by Joe Johnston based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg. Now I wasn't quite excited to see the films considering the reviews. But I did enjoy Zathura, the spiritual sequel to this film so I deiced to give it a go. And to my surprise I was quite entertained by the film. Plot: Judy and Peter play a board game to some disastrous results. Story and direction: The film opens up with 2 children from 1869 burying something and saying that whoever opens this up may God be with them. I mean this scene was basically not necessary. The film could have opened from 1969 with our protagonist Alan Parrish. We see Alan's world where he is bullied a lot and hides in his father's shoe factory. There we are introduced to Carl who I think was not necessary for the film in the first place. Then we see Alan taking the Jumanji game to his home and opening it. in the meanwhile, we see Alan's parents deciding to send him to boarding school to which he objects and decides never to talk to them again. Then Alan and Sarah begin to play the game when Alan gets sucked into it and Sarah getting scared runs for her life. Then the film takes a 26 year leap, where we are introduced to 2 new characters Peter and Judy, who have been given a quite nice back story. They open up the game and while they playing Alan comes out of it. Then we are taken on a joyride where the try to finish the game with a now grown Sarah. Now the thing that felt awful in the film was the CGI. It felt like you were watching some big patches of imagery that were just pasted onto the screen. Then I guess the Van Pelt character. He was just too laughable for me. And was wasted a lot. And finally, the revised 1995 version wherein some things were not explained rightly, according to me. Performances: Robin Williams made me remember that why I will be remembering him as a great actor. His comic timing was spot on. RIP Sir Williams. Bonnie Hunt was also great as Sarah. Kirsten Dunst was a great child artist in the film. So as Bradley Pierce. Favirite Scene: The scene where Alan pops up to save Peter and Judy from a lion and his joy that he has returned home after 26 years of being trapped in the game. Robin Williams just acted so great in this scene. Verdict: Although with some misses, Jumanji is a very much watchable film. I enjoyed my time with this movie. I am going with a 7.5/10 Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Has more depth than the book, but lacks much of its lustre; When I was in fifth Grade, I read a book called Jumanji. It was a 1982 book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera. A year later (February or March 1996), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In 1869, two young chaps bury in a chest \"Jumanji\", a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy. 100 years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in 1969, but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight\"; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic 1995, where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost... Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm. The other three characters, but the movie is so focused on the four players that everyone else looks like a decoration set. The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining . But the screenplay touches on the drama scenes so lightly that they do not create much justice to the film. The anarchic present looks like a throwback of Back to the Future II's Alternate 1985. But all ends well at the conclusion, and people will find it likable, including those who read the book. By the way, this was the first time I heard about Kirsten Dunst... **1/2 out of **** Grade A Effects; This movie is the kind of movie you wouldn't want to watch when you're trying to get to sleep. This movie is lurking with action and adventure around every corner, along with some animals. Great effects, good plot, and interesting characters. A *** out of ****.</td>\n",

       "      <td>forget the fussing; As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the 1st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life &amp; Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau &amp; Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman &amp; John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a 7.4 out of 10 the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. 7/10 stars. Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5. Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter &amp; Jack's previous films together. It was this film &amp; the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max &amp; John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from 1995. The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe 8yrs old, and must have seen it over 100 x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it 15 minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. One of the best movies of 1995!; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10 Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT 7 out of 10 Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. 2/5 stars - John Ulmer More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in 1995, 2 years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie 8 out of 10. The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. I give this one 2 out of 10. Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" Hilarious in Parts; 1995 was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in 1995, the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life. Please. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this 1995 film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about 15 or 16 and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. A 3 is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Great female flick of the '90s!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track 6: This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops &amp; horrible movies. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker. 6 of 10 stars. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the 1951 movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the 1950 classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the 4 year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $15k bonus to move out in 10 days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $100k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a 10, i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. 5/10 Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. 2.5 out of 5 stars. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in 1995. It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW2, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the 1951 sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of 50. This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late '40's)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie.</td>\n",



       "0  Best Film of the 90's!; That film has made its first success with the most beloved buddy picture of all time! The Next Who Framed Roger Rabbit I love how they try to make something different with CGI, because all they've done in the beginning were commercials and shorts. Ever since John Lasseter saw Tron, he knew that CGI would go all over the place. And boy has Pixar nailed it! The Story has taken itself to a whole new level, it's all about getting back to a young boy by using the power of teamwork, accepting for what you are, and telling the truth in an innocent way. Woody never meant to hurt Buzz, he just wanted to spend his life with Andy. The other toys are blinded by this accident that they decide to toss their leader out like garbage. Sid is what I believe the best villain for three reasons 1.He's the bully for the toys 2.He's stuck in the mind of a mad doctor or scientist 3.He learns an important lesson that toys are meant to be in heaven, not in toy hell. Unless you're a Losto Bear who thinks that humans are the enemies. Man! This is the reason why people loved the 90's. There was a time when animation wanted to push itself to next level. And Toy Story was one the important examples of being the greatest survivors with a lovely story, fresh start animation, amazing characters, and epic songs by Randy Newman. This could be a fresh start for those who wanna tell stories. In fact I have novel that I'm working on. It's on my Watpadd. Check it out https://www.wattpad.com/story/37790294-meme-world Toys, a symbol of our childhood; This film tells a story of rivalry between two toys: a cowboy doll named Woody and an action figure named Buzz Lightyear. They will fight for the affection of a child from the moment that Buzz is offered to him as a gift, threatening Woody's place as his favorite toy. A rivalry that will lead to a strong friendship between them. Directed by John Lasseter, one of the brightest minds of Pixar Studios, the film features the voices of Tom Hanks (as Woody) and Tim Allen (as Buzz) for the main characters. This was the film that launched Pixar to success, in a journey that still goes and deserves the respect of all admirers of the seventh art. The story of this film is deeply moving, not only to focus on strong themes like loyalty and friendship but, mainly, because it mess with our fondest memories by involving toys that we all played when we were kids. Its not a coincidence that we see, in this film, toys of our parents and grandparents living with action figures and games of our time. This film tries to touch everyone, from the small audience to the adults who take them to the movies. It's a great movie for the family and it's still current today, twenty years after his premiere. great job; this movie was such a great family movie. My daughter absolutely loves all the toy story movies we watched every single one of them and it always gets to us. great job to the creator of the movie. I loved how my daughter reacts to the movie when her favorite part comes up. I think she seen this movie so many times she probably knows the lines already. Woody is such an awesome cowboys i think he is one of my favorite characters along with little Bo-peep and slinky. Every toy in that movie make a really good team. I thought it was mean that woody pushed buzz out the window because he was a jealous toy. But I'm glad him and buzz get along great. one of the best animated; In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present, a group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy Davis (John Morris), are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his single mother (Laurie Metcalf) and infant sister Molly are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess (Annie Potts), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex the Dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberger) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge (R. Lee Ermey), spy on the party and report the results to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift  an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who believes that he is an actual space ranger. Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie; I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about. Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys. The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys. Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film. toys are alive; ****spoiler***** All of children have some toys, for example, baby dole, teddy bear, gun and so on, but everyone doesn't think that the toys able to move, speak and have their live. If it was true, it is a little scared, but it is so interesting to image their living. But in this movie, it seem that the toys don't know that they are made by someone at first. The setting is so interesting, When BUZZ he is a new toy of his master knows that he is not a real hero, he is so depressed because he had lost his identity. But the lead character, WOODY, helps him, even if he is hated by his friends. The time when BUZZ accepts his real potential and gets over a trial with WOODY makes us exciting and it makes us forget that they are toys sometimes. This is the first successful film which is the CG animation for Disney films and the anecdote of STEVE JOBS and JOHN ALAN LASSETER will not disappear forever. Great fun, a film that's not just for kids; I wasn't too sure about this film before I watched it. The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story. The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up  something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space! Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home. Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is 6 years old, but I've only just seen it!). The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others  such as Mr. Potato Head  are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep  who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries! The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back. Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible. The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films  particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations. All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again. And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them? Well, now we know why! The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in 1937 lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Fantastic animated movie for all ages.; Toy Story is a fantastic animated movie for all ages. The movies stars toys brought to life and their tiny adventures. Full of thrill, comedy and charm. Even though the computer graphics are starting to get a bit dated, it's incredibly fascinating seeing Pixars humble beginnings. This is the movie that laid the groundwork for their continued successes. The movie stars Tim Allan as Buzz Lightyear, Tom Hanks as Woody, just to name a few of the talented actors that have loaned their voices to this instant classic. I highly recommended this movie to anyone looking for a good time. Pixar's overall #1 best, one of the best parts of my childhood, overall best animated film, and one of the best films in general as well; Toy Story is the very first animated film ever made in history, it's the overall best and set the bar high for plenty of future computer animated films in general for a lot of good reasons. Pixar's first film takes place in a world where toys come alive when nobody is around, the story centers around a pull string cowboy doll named Woody who's voiced by Tom Hanks, he's the favorite toy of a young boy named Andy, but that changes when Andy gets a new action figure for his birthday, that particular toy is Buzz Lightyear who is voiced by Tim Allen, Buzz wins all the attention which makes Woody inevitably jealous and forces him to try to get rid of Buzz, resulting in them getting separated from Andy, therefore, they must put their differences aside and try to get back to Andy before him and his family move to their new house. With great writers like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, and Joss Whedon, the story as a whole needs nothing more and nothing less, it's just right, every scene advances the story forward. The characters are all memorable, the Pizza Planet aliens, the cowardly Rex voiced by Wallace Shawn, the know-it-all Hamm the piggy bank voiced by John Ratzenberger, the loyal Slinky-Dog voiced by Jim Varney, and the sassy and rude but always hilarious Mr. Potato-Head who's voiced by Don Rickles. But the best characters are the two main protagonists, Buzz Lightyear is a character that took a life of his own and became a pop-cultural phenomenon over night, even getting his own TV show, in fact in December 1995 every child on the planet wanted a Buzz Lightyear action figure, which is what Buzz represents the toy we all wanted when we were kids but weren't lucky enough to get, the ultimate action hero of the ultimate hero, and on top of all that casting Tim Allen to do his voice is by far one the best voice over performances of all time. Then there's Woody, Tom Hanks' performance as the sheriff of these parts was outrageously flawless, he's an old soul and his case is quite literal, considering he is a toy from the early generation which we didn't grow up in, but he is probably the character we can relate to the most. As for the best scene, the end of the final chase scene when Buzz and Woody are flying through the air after almost being blown up by a rocket: Woody: Hey Buzz you're flying! Buzz: this isn't flying, this is falling with style! Where Buzz finally achieves what he knew he could do from the start and Woody can put his doubts aside. Get the family together and get ready to go as Buzz and Woody put it \"TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!\"  This movie was one of the best 3d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an 8.5.(I gave it an 8) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of 3d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! G.o.a.t; I loved this film. For me, this is the best animated movie of all time. I think the story is very heartfelt and captures the relationship between a young boy and his toys really well. It has a universal message that applies to all ages: love. I think they did a great job with the range of characters, too; Each one brings a different perspective/attitude that really crosses over into real life whilst maintaining true to their toy-personality. This movie has good elements of comedy and drama, good guys/bad guys, heroes and aliens. It is a feel-good, timeless movie that will be relevant for generations to come. Good, Creative charm for kids and adults!; I'm not a huge fan of animated films, so coming into Toy Story I had very low expectations. At first, I thought it was Meh. Then, as the movie progressed it got better and better. Buzz is funny, Woody is a good cowboy, Sid is awesomely evil. Toy Story has an amazing cast as well. I mean, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, AND the Amazing Don RICKLES as Mr. Potato Head! Toy Story keeps kids and adults on their feet and I'm praising it so much because I have never seen any ANIMATED film as good as Toy Story so far. Disney really worked their magic into this classic. Toy Story FTW. I'm going to go rent Toy Story 2, and see if this film series has advanced even further. The one that started it all; In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In 1995, they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be 100% made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history. The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having \"souls\" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was. Rating: 9,5/10 Best Kids Movie of All-Time; When ever I here someone hating on this movie I cant believe it. What is not to like about this movie? It is a story about realizing who your true friends are in times of trouble and learning to live with what you are. This movie is something not only kids will like but their parents will love it too. I know for a while my mom liked this movie more than I did. Tom Hanks was perfect for the role of Woody and his paranoid attitude is what makes the movie what it is (morally). Change is a good thing and this movie changed everything. Even though the graphics are obviously outdated everything still works as well as it did almost 20 years ago! and Im feeling old.... But it is a must see for anyone i would love to buy this movie but i cannot find it anywhere, that says something. Hanks and Allen are hilarious even animated!; As if Tom Hanks wasn't talented enough...someone had the brilliant idea to animate him! Not to mention pair Hanks great sense of humor with comedic genius Tim Allen! Together, these two keep the giggles and laughs coming in this cute and successful Disney Pixar flick that spawned an even cuter sequal! Pixar's first full length movie.; This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back 10 years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies. Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only 7 when I first watched it in theaters). The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like \"Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc.\" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him. Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a \"Buzz Lightyear\" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys. Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more. I give it an 8/10 perfect movie for the whole family to watch. One Of The Great Animated Features Of The 1990's!; If you love Toy Story 2, then, you'll love this original classic!!! The first Disney/Pixar production (And, the first animated feature to be computer made) is well worth a double feature with Toy Story 2-of course! If A Bug's Life can knock Antz and The Prince Of Egypt out of the minds of moviegoers, Toy Story have no rivals to forget! One of a kind! - the first computer-animated film and a touching story of friendship; This movie is just awesome! Bearing in mind that this was a film from 1994/95, the quality of the realistic 3D animation is stunning and what a perfect way to start a new era! Just as a new form of animation comes to life, a vast number of toys magically come to life when their child-owner Andy is out of the room. Maybe that's a true-to-life symbolisation! From the word go, every single one of those toys have become so famous and iconic. Argos (especially), Toys R Us, Amazon, Woolworths and more have never, since the film's 1995-release, been without stock of them! Like it says in the summary, it's a heart-warming story as well as a funny, super-cool movie about a pull-string ragdoll (Woody) whose popularity is short-lived as Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday as a result of new electronic toys hitting the market proving to be better than a just a ragdoll. Understandably, Woody is jealous of Buzz and can't stand his guts. He's an arrogant, self-interested toy but, more than anything else, an total, utter idiot. All the toys have their own personalities; there's Little Bo Peep who has a soft spot for Woody, Slinky Dog who likes Woody and is very friendly, Rex the world's most IRRITATING dinosaur ever, RC, the RC who revs up and down rather than talks and then there's Mr Potato Head and he is VILE! So, so mean and frequently rude. He seems to have some kind of vendetta against Woody for no reason I can think of. Then, he creates his very own campaign to destroy Woody in order to avenge Buzz when Woody's the one who has felt lonely and unwanted for so long! You'd think it'd put children off the authentic Mr Potato Head by Playskool! Oh yes and there's one more toy I didn't mention - Lenny, the toy-sized pair of binoculars. He was voiced by Joe Ranft who contributed in the story development of \"Toy Story\" and is now sadly no longer on this earth. He was killed when the speed of his car went beyond control, crashed through the wall of a bridge and plunged into the river below. The Pixar team miss him terribly... JOE RANFT 1960-2005 The one that started it all; Toy Story will forever be remembered as the first feature film to be fully animated by computer. Since its debut in 1995, dozens more have joined it, including a sequel (soon to be two sequels as of this writing), as well as several other excellent films from its animation company, Pixar. However, for its unique accomplishment, Toy Story stands alone. It doesn't hurt that even beyond the technical achievement, the film is charming, well-written, and touching. The toys in question belong to Andy, who has a huge variety of them scattered around his room. The unofficial head toy is Woody, a cowboy toy who has \"been Andy's favorite since kindergarten\". Woody loves being the favored toy, but the order is shaken up when Andy receives a surprise present on his birthday: a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who causes Woody to become jealous when he begins to take over the #1 toy position in Andy's playtime. There's a lot of good stuff in this film: The animation, which mostly still works 15 years later; the voice acting, which is carried out excellently; the story, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. What gets me most about Toy Story is the way that both Woody and Buzz must grow throughout the movie. Woody has to let go of his jealousy and accept that things change when someone new enters the mix. Buzz has to learn (the hard way) that he really is a toy, but that he has a very important role as such. This is better character development than we see in some \"more mature\" films. It was here that Pixar began a long line of memorable, excellently crafted characters. Pixar has released ten feature films in the past fifteen years. Toy Story 3 this summer will make eleven. They've maintained a very high standard of quality during that time. It definitely helps that, with Toy Story, they were off to an excellent start. First Pixar Film, Did Amazing; I Recentely Re-Watched Toy Story And I Think That Every Time I Watch This Film, It Gets Better. This Is Basically The Plot. Sheriff Toy Is Jealous When A New, Cooler Toy Named Buzz Lightyear Came And Changed The Sheriff. Then The Sheriff And The Space Ranger Are Proceeded To Be Tortured By A Toy-Torturer Named Sid, A Boy Who Loves Giving Pain To All Toys. I Think That This Film Is One of, If Not, One of The Best 3D Animated Movies EVER. Some Scenes Give You The Feels, Some Get You Into The Movie. Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) Was A Masterpiece In This First Installment of The Toy Story Trilogy. Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) Was Completely Enthusiastic In This Movie. I Think Most People Think Sid Is A Toy Serial Killer. I Agree. Sid Is Completely At It With Giving His 'Pain Surgery' To Fellow Toys Who Were Tormented By His Schemes. This Movie Has A Great Plot, Gives Character Development, Chose Great Actors That Overall, Enjoyed Their Parts! This Deserves At Least A 9/10 For An Outstanding 3D Animated Movie In 1995. It's a Happy Movie! Ya there's spoilers; I put this computer animated movie just on the cusp of being great. You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time...8.7/10 This DVD is part of the Toy Story 2 Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages. Quality animation always looks good on the big screen and this looks wonderful. This is a Buy and Hold to flesh out your collection to include 'Happy Movies' as my daughter puts it. The DVD is a solid 9/10 Awesome; A very sweet and fun movie. TOY STORY has great computer animation. A simple yet well told story is also added as well. The voice overs are top notch and everyone gets a fair share in this movie. PIXAR has done a good job placing itself on the map. Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle. Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel. A good rent. On it's 20th Birthday, Toy Story still soars To Infinity and Beyond!; In 1989, Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help. They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as \"Toy Story\", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about. First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the \"I'm Mrs Nesbitt\" sequence and the \"You Are A Toy\" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies \"You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic \"To Infinity and Beyond\" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history. There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's 81 minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" and \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" hit the right notes by being memorable songs. Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school. Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late 2000s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy 20th Birthday. Classic!; \"Toy Story\" is one of the best animated films ever created! The movie is about Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) hating each other like no other. Buzz accidently fell out of the window and Woody is accused by all the other toys of having killed him. He has to go look for him outside so they can return to Andy's room. But they got into trouble by a toy torturer while trying to get home. \"Toy Story\" is a must-see for everybody who likes Disney and it is for all ages to watch! Followed by an amazing sequel! 10/10 stars!  \n",

The effects were groundbreaking. The movie itself is highly original. What are you waiting for! if you haven't seen this, be ready for some quality family time! why an 8? Because it is simply fun and entertaining. Sure it is not a perfect movie , but this is what a movie is supposed to be. i am SHOCKED by the low rating!!! 6.5 really?, Unlike dark knight or inception, which are awful in every way, this is actually entertaining and fun. A little creepy for the faint of heart... \"kids\" but they will survive! this is in a world of its own!!!!! and it deserves far more then the 6.5 it receives id like to see it reaching a 7.5 for entertainment value only! not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late 1960s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is 1969, and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats. 26 years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good! Stupid, but fun, family adventure; Board games aren't as popular as they used to be. Before the likes of Xbox and Facebook, we had classic board games such as Go For Broke and Game Of Life. Luckily, we didn't have anything like Jumanji; a mystical board game which magically comes to life as you're playing. It sounds incredibly fun, which is what young Alan Parrish thinks, minutes before he is sucked into the game and left to fend for himself for 30 years. Reawakened by a younger generation, old Alan, played by the late Robin Williams, must finish the game before it engulfs the entire town. If it sounds a little ridiculous, that's because it is. But it is a heck of a lot of fun as well. Robin Williams brings his usual maniacal charm and injects healthy doses of humour when the movie threatens to take itself too seriously and a young Kirsten Dunst offers ample support as one of the younger players. But the real star of the show is the effects; we are treated to scenes of an animal stampede through the streets, a monsoon inside a huge mansion and, in a wonderful subplot, one of the players is gradually transformed into a monkey because he tries to cheat the game. It is almost 20 years old now so, understandably, some of the effects don't quite hold up, with the monkeys being the prime example but the premise is so much fun that you won't really mind a few dodgy effects shots here or there. It also takes a little while to find its feet, with the beginning seeming to drag on for a little longer than necessary, and the ending may be a little to sickly sweet for some tastes. But once the main plot gets going it barely stops for breath as the players have to deal with any threat that the game delivers and a big part of the fun is waiting to see what the game will spit out next. A wonderfully fun family film with plenty of thrills and a great premise. Not for 13+ age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for 1980 not for 1995. Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. review for jumanji.; This 1995 film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game 26 years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are 8+ as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than 8 and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. IT's the most great movie EVER, you can't get Enough of it; I want to give this movie what it really deserve ,If i will say there is movie that i will never forget in my life ,it will be this great movie for the brilliant actor robin Williams. first of all, I want to thanks all the cast of this movie and the great director ,for bringing it to us. when I want to be refresh and happy and laugh I will watch it when I want to feel the power of love and the thriller of adventure, I will watch it , there are a lot of people how see it as for children only but its really not , it was like they know where to start and finish. this movie is for everyone its my best movie ever I give it 10%10 don't miss it original, not like any other game; I saw this when I was 9, and I was obsessed with it and saw it 3 times in the theater, and it was my favorite movie. The whole idea of slight, unhappy, 12-year-old Alan Parrsih (Adam Hann-Byrd-Little man Tate, Halloween H:20) getting trapped in a board game in 1969, for 26-years and coming back as a grown man. The idea was unforgettable to my interest in time, and I imagined my self then coming back 35-years old. The movie is so elaborate and original, the stampede was always my favorite, it's got such edge-of-year seat action with the Rhinos, Elephants, and Zebras crashing throught the wall at the last second, and they used the most dangerous animals possible. Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) ALan's childhood friend, and Peter (Bradley Pierce) and Judy (Kirsten Dunst, along with Alan play the game and bring Gian mosquitos, vines and a Hunter from the game. The movies also really funny especially the cop. Robin Williams Best Film; Robin Williams is a great actor who has made some great films over the years but I think Jumanji is the best. I mean, what more could you possibly ask for? It's a great idea-as a child I would have loved a board-game like that. It's certainly a very gripping movie throughout-the more the players get involved the worse things become. Before you know it elephant's and rhino's are on the loose trashing a town and there's a mad hunter lurking around too. This is one of those films which you can watch again and again and still enjoy. I recommend it highly-it has a great plot, great acting and some great scenes. Watch out for the scene with the male lion on the bed.  Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... Great fun; Robin Williams is in his element as an adult/child and with wonderful support from Kirsten Dunst, Ian Richardson playing the Englishman hunter and sending himself up nicely, the excellent children and others make this escapist adventure at it's best. Til the dice read five or eight \n",
       " Jumanji; Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in 1995, I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 1800's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in 1969, transporting him into the jungle world for 26 years until two new children stumble upon its drumming. Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time \n",
       " well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects. The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be \"real\", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end. The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still childrenone had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow upand with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think. There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as \"Soulman\" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the \"adult\" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal. good original family movie; Joe Johnston's Jumanji is very good family movie that is well paced. The movie is the story of a mysterious game that involves it's players more than the normal board game. The movie begins with a young boy, Alan Parrish, finding the abandoned game. He talks the girl he has a crush on, Sarah Whittle, into playing with him. Once the game starts, chaos ensues. Robin Williams carries this movie, giving it life. The other actors do okay with the bare dialogue. Joe Johnston uses the experiences on the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies to craft a fantasy world that is believable. Though not outstanding in any way, Jumanji is a fun movie that should delight children with its action and fantasy. 6 out of 10 stars. Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for 25(?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\" Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a 10/10. My first childhood film and one of my all time favorites!; I was born in 1994 so I am one year older than but my Uncle bought a copy of Jumanji when I was in pre-school and the whole family watched it together. And after seeing the film for the first time, the story is just like a funny adventure to me and I really love it. I always sneak up to the CD cabinet to watch it again because my grandmother always gone mad every time I switch the CD player and the television. And after a several replays, the movie grown deeper to me; the message of the film and everything. Until now, I still watch the movie and still having lots of laugh. A Great Family Entertainer!; Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid & I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism & magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh & Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining & magical. It offers humor, magic & emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd & Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up! Jumanji Review; Jumanji is a film directed by Joe Johnston based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg. Now I wasn't quite excited to see the films considering the reviews. But I did enjoy Zathura, the spiritual sequel to this film so I deiced to give it a go. And to my surprise I was quite entertained by the film. Plot: Judy and Peter play a board game to some disastrous results. Story and direction: The film opens up with 2 children from 1869 burying something and saying that whoever opens this up may God be with them. I mean this scene was basically not necessary. The film could have opened from 1969 with our protagonist Alan Parrish. We see Alan's world where he is bullied a lot and hides in his father's shoe factory. There we are introduced to Carl who I think was not necessary for the film in the first place. Then we see Alan taking the Jumanji game to his home and opening it. in the meanwhile, we see Alan's parents deciding to send him to boarding school to which he objects and decides never to talk to them again. Then Alan and Sarah begin to play the game when Alan gets sucked into it and Sarah getting scared runs for her life. Then the film takes a 26 year leap, where we are introduced to 2 new characters Peter and Judy, who have been given a quite nice back story. They open up the game and while they playing Alan comes out of it. Then we are taken on a joyride where the try to finish the game with a now grown Sarah. Now the thing that felt awful in the film was the CGI. It felt like you were watching some big patches of imagery that were just pasted onto the screen. Then I guess the Van Pelt character. He was just too laughable for me. And was wasted a lot. And finally, the revised 1995 version wherein some things were not explained rightly, according to me. Performances: Robin Williams made me remember that why I will be remembering him as a great actor. His comic timing was spot on. RIP Sir Williams. Bonnie Hunt was also great as Sarah. Kirsten Dunst was a great child artist in the film. So as Bradley Pierce. Favirite Scene: The scene where Alan pops up to save Peter and Judy from a lion and his joy that he has returned home after 26 years of being trapped in the game. Robin Williams just acted so great in this scene. Verdict: Although with some misses, Jumanji is a very much watchable film. I enjoyed my time with this movie. I am going with a 7.5/10 Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Has more depth than the book, but lacks much of its lustre; When I was in fifth Grade, I read a book called Jumanji. It was a 1982 book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera. A year later (February or March 1996), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In 1869, two young chaps bury in a chest \"Jumanji\", a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy. 100 years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in 1969, but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight\"; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic 1995, where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost... Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm. The other three characters, but the movie is so focused on the four players that everyone else looks like a decoration set. The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining . But the screenplay touches on the drama scenes so lightly that they do not create much justice to the film. The anarchic present looks like a throwback of Back to the Future II's Alternate 1985. But all ends well at the conclusion, and people will find it likable, including those who read the book. By the way, this was the first time I heard about Kirsten Dunst... **1/2 out of **** Grade A Effects; This movie is the kind of movie you wouldn't want to watch when you're trying to get to sleep. This movie is lurking with action and adventure around every corner, along with some animals. Great effects, good plot, and interesting characters. A *** out of ****.  \n",

          forget the fussing; As a 50++ female who married again only 2 years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at 7 AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the 1st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life & Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau & Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman & John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a 7.4 out of 10 the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in 1995, noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A(1) vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A(2) there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(1), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(2), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my 88-year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG-13 rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was 61 at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was 75--a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. 7/10 stars. Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from 1993. The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment. 2 stars out of 5. Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter & Jack's previous films together. It was this film & the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max & John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the 2 adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. Classic sequel, better than 1st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the 1st --8.5 out of 10 for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from 1995. The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe 8yrs old, and must have seen it over 100 x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it 15 minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four) Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. One of the best movies of 1995!; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having 2 or 3 scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about 10 minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as 6/10 Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT 7 out of 10 Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. 2/5 stars - John Ulmer More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in 1995, 2 years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie 8 out of 10. The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from 1995 is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $5 of the $6 that I paid to see it. I give this one 2 out of 10. Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" Hilarious in Parts; 1995 was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in 1995, the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life. Please. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this 1995 film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about 15 or 16 and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. A 3 is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Great female flick of the '90s!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track 6: This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops & horrible movies. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses.

Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker. 6 of 10 stars. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the 1951 movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the 1950 classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the 4 year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $15k bonus to move out in 10 days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $100k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a 10, i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. 5/10 Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. 2.5 out of 5 stars. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in 1995. It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW2, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the 1951 sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of 50. This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late '40's)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie.  "

       "      <td>Best Film of the 's!; That film has made its first success with the most beloved buddy picture of all time! The Next Who Framed Roger Rabbit I love how they try to make something different with CGI, because all they've done in the beginning were commercials and shorts. Ever since John Lasseter saw Tron, he knew that CGI would go all over the place. And boy has Pixar nailed it! The Story has taken itself to a whole new level, it's all about getting back to a young boy by using the power of teamwork, accepting for what you are, and telling the truth in an innocent way. Woody never meant to hurt Buzz, he just wanted to spend his life with Andy. The other toys are blinded by this accident that they decide to toss their leader out like garbage. Sid is what I believe the best villain for three reasons .He's the bully for the toys .He's stuck in the mind of a mad doctor or scientist .He learns an important lesson that toys are meant to be in heaven, not in toy hell. Unless you're a Losto Bear who thinks that humans are the enemies. Man! This is the reason why people loved the 's. There was a time when animation wanted to push itself to next level. And Toy Story was one the important examples of being the greatest survivors with a lovely story, fresh start animation, amazing characters, and epic songs by Randy Newman. This could be a fresh start for those who wanna tell stories. In fact I have novel that I'm working on. It's on my Watpadd. Check it out https://www.wattpad.com/story/-meme-world Toys, a symbol of our childhood; This film tells a story of rivalry between two toys: a cowboy doll named Woody and an action figure named Buzz Lightyear. They will fight for the affection of a child from the moment that Buzz is offered to him as a gift, threatening Woody's place as his favorite toy. A rivalry that will lead to a strong friendship between them. Directed by John Lasseter, one of the brightest minds of Pixar Studios, the film features the voices of Tom Hanks (as Woody) and Tim Allen (as Buzz) for the main characters. This was the film that launched Pixar to success, in a journey that still goes and deserves the respect of all admirers of the seventh art. The story of this film is deeply moving, not only to focus on strong themes like loyalty and friendship but, mainly, because it mess with our fondest memories by involving toys that we all played when we were kids. Its not a coincidence that we see, in this film, toys of our parents and grandparents living with action figures and games of our time. This film tries to touch everyone, from the small audience to the adults who take them to the movies. It's a great movie for the family and it's still current today, twenty years after his premiere. great job; this movie was such a great family movie. My daughter absolutely loves all the toy story movies we watched every single one of them and it always gets to us. great job to the creator of the movie. I loved how my daughter reacts to the movie when her favorite part comes up. I think she seen this movie so many times she probably knows the lines already. Woody is such an awesome cowboys i think he is one of my favorite characters along with little Bo-peep and slinky. Every toy in that movie make a really good team. I thought it was mean that woody pushed buzz out the window because he was a jealous toy. But I'm glad him and buzz get along great. one of the best animated; In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present, a group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy Davis (John Morris), are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his single mother (Laurie Metcalf) and infant sister Molly are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess (Annie Potts), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex the Dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberger) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge (R. Lee Ermey), spy on the party and report the results to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift  an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who believes that he is an actual space ranger. Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie; I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about. Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys. The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys. Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film. toys are alive; ****spoiler***** All of children have some toys, for example, baby dole, teddy bear, gun and so on, but everyone doesn't think that the toys able to move, speak and have their live. If it was true, it is a little scared, but it is so interesting to image their living. But in this movie, it seem that the toys don't know that they are made by someone at first. The setting is so interesting, When BUZZ he is a new toy of his master knows that he is not a real hero, he is so depressed because he had lost his identity. But the lead character, WOODY, helps him, even if he is hated by his friends. The time when BUZZ accepts his real potential and gets over a trial with WOODY makes us exciting and it makes us forget that they are toys sometimes. This is the first successful film which is the CG animation for Disney films and the anecdote of STEVE JOBS and JOHN ALAN LASSETER will not disappear forever. Great fun, a film that's not just for kids; I wasn't too sure about this film before I watched it. The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story. The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up  something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space! Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home. Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is  years old, but I've only just seen it!). The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others  such as Mr. Potato Head  are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep  who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries! The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back. Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible. The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films  particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations. All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again. And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them? Well, now we know why! The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in  lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Fantastic animated movie for all ages.; Toy Story is a fantastic animated movie for all ages. The movies stars toys brought to life and their tiny adventures. Full of thrill, comedy and charm. Even though the computer graphics are starting to get a bit dated, it's incredibly fascinating seeing Pixars humble beginnings. This is the movie that laid the groundwork for their continued successes. The movie stars Tim Allan as Buzz Lightyear, Tom Hanks as Woody, just to name a few of the talented actors that have loaned their voices to this instant classic. I highly recommended this movie to anyone looking for a good time. Pixar's overall # best, one of the best parts of my childhood, overall best animated film, and one of the best films in general as well; Toy Story is the very first animated film ever made in history, it's the overall best and set the bar high for plenty of future computer animated films in general for a lot of good reasons. Pixar's first film takes place in a world where toys come alive when nobody is around, the story centers around a pull string cowboy doll named Woody who's voiced by Tom Hanks, he's the favorite toy of a young boy named Andy, but that changes when Andy gets a new action figure for his birthday, that particular toy is Buzz Lightyear who is voiced by Tim Allen, Buzz wins all the attention which makes Woody inevitably jealous and forces him to try to get rid of Buzz, resulting in them getting separated from Andy, therefore, they must put their differences aside and try to get back to Andy before him and his family move to their new house. With great writers like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, and Joss Whedon, the story as a whole needs nothing more and nothing less, it's just right, every scene advances the story forward. The characters are all memorable, the Pizza Planet aliens, the cowardly Rex voiced by Wallace Shawn, the know-it-all Hamm the piggy bank voiced by John Ratzenberger, the loyal Slinky-Dog voiced by Jim Varney, and the sassy and rude but always hilarious Mr. Potato-Head who's voiced by Don Rickles. But the best characters are the two main protagonists, Buzz Lightyear is a character that took a life of his own and became a pop-cultural phenomenon over night, even getting his own TV show, in fact in December  every child on the planet wanted a Buzz Lightyear action figure, which is what Buzz represents the toy we all wanted when we were kids but weren't lucky enough to get, the ultimate action hero of the ultimate hero, and on top of all that casting Tim Allen to do his voice is by far one the best voice over performances of all time. Then there's Woody, Tom Hanks' performance as the sheriff of these parts was outrageously flawless, he's an old soul and his case is quite literal, considering he is a toy from the early generation which we didn't grow up in, but he is probably the character we can relate to the most. As for the best scene, the end of the final chase scene when Buzz and Woody are flying through the air after almost being blown up by a rocket: Woody: Hey Buzz you're flying! Buzz: this isn't flying, this is falling with style! Where Buzz finally achieves what he knew he could do from the start and Woody can put his doubts aside. Get the family together and get ready to go as Buzz and Woody put it \"TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!\"  This movie was one of the best d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an ..(I gave it an ) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! G.o.a.t; I loved this film. For me, this is the best animated movie of all time. I think the story is very heartfelt and captures the relationship between a young boy and his toys really well. It has a universal message that applies to all ages: love. I think they did a great job with the range of characters, too; Each one brings a different perspective/attitude that really crosses over into real life whilst maintaining true to their toy-personality. This movie has good elements of comedy and drama, good guys/bad guys, heroes and aliens. It is a feel-good, timeless movie that will be relevant for generations to come. Good, Creative charm for kids and adults!; I'm not a huge fan of animated films, so coming into Toy Story I had very low expectations. At first, I thought it was Meh. Then, as the movie progressed it got better and better. Buzz is funny, Woody is a good cowboy, Sid is awesomely evil. Toy Story has an amazing cast as well. I mean, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, AND the Amazing Don RICKLES as Mr. Potato Head! Toy Story keeps kids and adults on their feet and I'm praising it so much because I have never seen any ANIMATED film as good as Toy Story so far. Disney really worked their magic into this classic. Toy Story FTW. I'm going to go rent Toy Story , and see if this film series has advanced even further. The one that started it all; In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In , they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be % made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history. The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having \"souls\" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was. Rating: ,/ Best Kids Movie of All-Time; When ever I here someone hating on this movie I cant believe it. What is not to like about this movie? It is a story about realizing who your true friends are in times of trouble and learning to live with what you are. This movie is something not only kids will like but their parents will love it too. I know for a while my mom liked this movie more than I did. Tom Hanks was perfect for the role of Woody and his paranoid attitude is what makes the movie what it is (morally). Change is a good thing and this movie changed everything. Even though the graphics are obviously outdated everything still works as well as it did almost  years ago! and Im feeling old.... But it is a must see for anyone i would love to buy this movie but i cannot find it anywhere, that says something. Hanks and Allen are hilarious even animated!; As if Tom Hanks wasn't talented enough...someone had the brilliant idea to animate him! Not to mention pair Hanks great sense of humor with comedic genius Tim Allen! Together, these two keep the giggles and laughs coming in this cute and successful Disney Pixar flick that spawned an even cuter sequal! Pixar's first full length movie.; This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back  years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies. Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only  when I first watched it in theaters). The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like \"Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc.\" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him. Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a \"Buzz Lightyear\" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys. Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more. I give it an / perfect movie for the whole family to watch. One Of The Great Animated Features Of The 's!; If you love Toy Story , then, you'll love this original classic!!! The first Disney/Pixar production (And, the first animated feature to be computer made) is well worth a double feature with Toy Story -of course! If A Bug's Life can knock Antz and The Prince Of Egypt out of the minds of moviegoers, Toy Story have no rivals to forget! One of a kind! - the first computer-animated film and a touching story of friendship; This movie is just awesome! Bearing in mind that this was a film from /, the quality of the realistic D animation is stunning and what a perfect way to start a new era! Just as a new form of animation comes to life, a vast number of toys magically come to life when their child-owner Andy is out of the room. Maybe that's a true-to-life symbolisation! From the word go, every single one of those toys have become so famous and iconic. Argos (especially), Toys R Us, Amazon, Woolworths and more have never, since the film's -release, been without stock of them! Like it says in the summary, it's a heart-warming story as well as a funny, super-cool movie about a pull-string ragdoll (Woody) whose popularity is short-lived as Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday as a result of new electronic toys hitting the market proving to be better than a just a ragdoll. Understandably, Woody is jealous of Buzz and can't stand his guts. He's an arrogant, self-interested toy but, more than anything else, an total, utter idiot. All the toys have their own personalities; there's Little Bo Peep who has a soft spot for Woody, Slinky Dog who likes Woody and is very friendly, Rex the world's most IRRITATING dinosaur ever, RC, the RC who revs up and down rather than talks and then there's Mr Potato Head and he is VILE! So, so mean and frequently rude. He seems to have some kind of vendetta against Woody for no reason I can think of. Then, he creates his very own campaign to destroy Woody in order to avenge Buzz when Woody's the one who has felt lonely and unwanted for so long! You'd think it'd put children off the authentic Mr Potato Head by Playskool! Oh yes and there's one more toy I didn't mention - Lenny, the toy-sized pair of binoculars. He was voiced by Joe Ranft who contributed in the story development of \"Toy Story\" and is now sadly no longer on this earth. He was killed when the speed of his car went beyond control, crashed through the wall of a bridge and plunged into the river below. The Pixar team miss him terribly... JOE RANFT - The one that started it all; Toy Story will forever be remembered as the first feature film to be fully animated by computer. Since its debut in , dozens more have joined it, including a sequel (soon to be two sequels as of this writing), as well as several other excellent films from its animation company, Pixar. However, for its unique accomplishment, Toy Story stands alone. It doesn't hurt that even beyond the technical achievement, the film is charming, well-written, and touching. The toys in question belong to Andy, who has a huge variety of them scattered around his room. The unofficial head toy is Woody, a cowboy toy who has \"been Andy's favorite since kindergarten\". Woody loves being the favored toy, but the order is shaken up when Andy receives a surprise present on his birthday: a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who causes Woody to become jealous when he begins to take over the # toy position in Andy's playtime. There's a lot of good stuff in this film: The animation, which mostly still works  years later; the voice acting, which is carried out excellently; the story, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. What gets me most about Toy Story is the way that both Woody and Buzz must grow throughout the movie. Woody has to let go of his jealousy and accept that things change when someone new enters the mix. Buzz has to learn (the hard way) that he really is a toy, but that he has a very important role as such. This is better character development than we see in some \"more mature\" films. It was here that Pixar began a long line of memorable, excellently crafted characters. Pixar has released ten feature films in the past fifteen years. Toy Story  this summer will make eleven. They've maintained a very high standard of quality during that time. It definitely helps that, with Toy Story, they were off to an excellent start. First Pixar Film, Did Amazing; I Recentely Re-Watched Toy Story And I Think That Every Time I Watch This Film, It Gets Better. This Is Basically The Plot. Sheriff Toy Is Jealous When A New, Cooler Toy Named Buzz Lightyear Came And Changed The Sheriff. Then The Sheriff And The Space Ranger Are Proceeded To Be Tortured By A Toy-Torturer Named Sid, A Boy Who Loves Giving Pain To All Toys. I Think That This Film Is One of, If Not, One of The Best D Animated Movies EVER. Some Scenes Give You The Feels, Some Get You Into The Movie. Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) Was A Masterpiece In This First Installment of The Toy Story Trilogy. Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) Was Completely Enthusiastic In This Movie. I Think Most People Think Sid Is A Toy Serial Killer. I Agree. Sid Is Completely At It With Giving His 'Pain Surgery' To Fellow Toys Who Were Tormented By His Schemes. This Movie Has A Great Plot, Gives Character Development, Chose Great Actors That Overall, Enjoyed Their Parts! This Deserves At Least A / For An Outstanding D Animated Movie In . It's a Happy Movie! Ya there's spoilers; I put this computer animated movie just on the cusp of being great. You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time..../ This DVD is part of the Toy Story  Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages. Quality animation always looks good on the big screen and this looks wonderful. This is a Buy and Hold to flesh out your collection to include 'Happy Movies' as my daughter puts it. The DVD is a solid / Awesome; A very sweet and fun movie. TOY STORY has great computer animation. A simple yet well told story is also added as well. The voice overs are top notch and everyone gets a fair share in this movie. PIXAR has done a good job placing itself on the map. Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle. Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel. A good rent. On it's th Birthday, Toy Story still soars To Infinity and Beyond!; In , Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help. They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as \"Toy Story\", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about. First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the \"I'm Mrs Nesbitt\" sequence and the \"You Are A Toy\" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies \"You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic \"To Infinity and Beyond\" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history. There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's  minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" and \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" hit the right notes by being memorable songs. Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school. Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy th Birthday. Classic!; \"Toy Story\" is one of the best animated films ever created! The movie is about Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) hating each other like no other. Buzz accidently fell out of the window and Woody is accused by all the other toys of having killed him. He has to go look for him outside so they can return to Andy's room. But they got into trouble by a toy torturer while trying to get home. \"Toy Story\" is a must-see for everybody who likes Disney and it is for all ages to watch!

       "      <td>A great movie for All ages!; Jumanji! based on the story's by Chris Van Allsburg Robin Williams is a blast! The effects were groundbreaking. The movie itself is highly original. What are you waiting for! if you haven't seen this, be ready for some quality family time! why an ? Because it is simply fun and entertaining. Sure it is not a perfect movie , but this is what a movie is supposed to be. i am SHOCKED by the low rating!!! . really?, Unlike dark knight or inception, which are awful in every way, this is actually entertaining and fun. A little creepy for the faint of heart... \"kids\" but they will survive! this is in a world of its own!!!!! and it deserves far more then the . it receives id like to see it reaching a . for entertainment value only! not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is , and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats.  years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number  on The  Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number  on The  Greatest Family Films. Very good! Stupid, but fun, family adventure; Board games aren't as popular as they used to be. Before the likes of Xbox and Facebook, we had classic board games such as Go For Broke and Game Of Life. Luckily, we didn't have anything like Jumanji; a mystical board game which magically comes to life as you're playing. It sounds incredibly fun, which is what young Alan Parrish thinks, minutes before he is sucked into the game and left to fend for himself for  years. Reawakened by a younger generation, old Alan, played by the late Robin Williams, must finish the game before it engulfs the entire town. If it sounds a little ridiculous, that's because it is. But it is a heck of a lot of fun as well. Robin Williams brings his usual maniacal charm and injects healthy doses of humour when the movie threatens to take itself too seriously and a young Kirsten Dunst offers ample support as one of the younger players. But the real star of the show is the effects; we are treated to scenes of an animal stampede through the streets, a monsoon inside a huge mansion and, in a wonderful subplot, one of the players is gradually transformed into a monkey because he tries to cheat the game. It is almost  years old now so, understandably, some of the effects don't quite hold up, with the monkeys being the prime example but the premise is so much fun that you won't really mind a few dodgy effects shots here or there. It also takes a little while to find its feet, with the beginning seeming to drag on for a little longer than necessary, and the ending may be a little to sickly sweet for some tastes. But once the main plot gets going it barely stops for breath as the players have to deal with any threat that the game delivers and a big part of the fun is waiting to see what the game will spit out next. A wonderfully fun family film with plenty of thrills and a great premise. Not for + age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for  not for . Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. review for jumanji.; This  film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game  years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are + as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than  and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around  when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably  or , so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. IT's the most great movie EVER, you can't get Enough of it; I want to give this movie what it really deserve ,If i will say there is movie that i will never forget in my life ,it will be this great movie for the brilliant actor robin Williams. first of all, I want to thanks all the cast of this movie and the great director ,for bringing it to us. when I want to be refresh and happy and laugh I will watch it when I want to feel the power of love and the thriller of adventure, I will watch it , there are a lot of people how see it as for children only but its really not , it was like they know where to start and finish. this movie is for everyone its my best movie ever I give it % don't miss it original, not like any other game; I saw this when I was , and I was obsessed with it and saw it  times in the theater, and it was my favorite movie. The whole idea of slight, unhappy, -year-old Alan Parrsih (Adam Hann-Byrd-Little man Tate, Halloween H:) getting trapped in a board game in , for -years and coming back as a grown man. The idea was unforgettable to my interest in time, and I imagined my self then coming back -years old. The movie is so elaborate and original, the stampede was always my favorite, it's got such edge-of-year seat action with the Rhinos, Elephants, and Zebras crashing throught the wall at the last second, and they used the most dangerous animals possible. Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) ALan's childhood friend, and Peter (Bradley Pierce) and Judy (Kirsten Dunst, along with Alan play the game and bring Gian mosquitos, vines and a Hunter from the game. The movies also really funny especially the cop. Robin Williams Best Film; Robin Williams is a great actor who has made some great films over the years but I think Jumanji is the best. I mean, what more could you possibly ask for? It's a great idea-as a child I would have loved a board-game like that. It's certainly a very gripping movie throughout-the more the players get involved the worse things become. Before you know it elephant's and rhino's are on the loose trashing a town and there's a mad hunter lurking around too. This is one of those films which you can watch again and again and still enjoy. I recommend it highly-it has a great plot, great acting and some great scenes. Watch out for the scene with the male lion on the bed.  Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... Great fun; Robin Williams is in his element as an adult/child and with wonderful support from Kirsten Dunst, Ian Richardson playing the Englishman hunter and sending himself up nicely, the excellent children and others make this escapist adventure at it's best. Til the dice read five or eight \n",
       " Jumanji; Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in , I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in , transporting him into the jungle world for  years until two new children stumble upon its drumming. Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time \n",
       " well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects. The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be \"real\", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end. The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still childrenone had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow upand with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think. There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as \"Soulman\" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the \"adult\" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal. good original family movie; Joe Johnston's Jumanji is very good family movie that is well paced. The movie is the story of a mysterious game that involves it's players more than the normal board game. The movie begins with a young boy, Alan Parrish, finding the abandoned game. He talks the girl he has a crush on, Sarah Whittle, into playing with him. Once the game starts, chaos ensues. Robin Williams carries this movie, giving it life. The other actors do okay with the bare dialogue. Joe Johnston uses the experiences on the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies to craft a fantasy world that is believable. Though not outstanding in any way, Jumanji is a fun movie that should delight children with its action and fantasy.  out of  stars. Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for (?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\" Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a /. My first childhood film and one of my all time favorites!; I was born in  so I am one year older than but my Uncle bought a copy of Jumanji when I was in pre-school and the whole family watched it together. And after seeing the film for the first time, the story is just like a funny adventure to me and I really love it. I always sneak up to the CD cabinet to watch it again because my grandmother always gone mad every time I switch the CD player and the television. And after a several replays, the movie grown deeper to me; the message of the film and everything. Until now, I still watch the movie and still having lots of laugh. A Great Family Entertainer!; Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid &amp; I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism &amp; magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh &amp; Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining &amp; magical. It offers humor, magic &amp; emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography &amp; Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd &amp; Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up! Jumanji Review; Jumanji is a film directed by Joe Johnston based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg. Now I wasn't quite excited to see the films considering the reviews. But I did enjoy Zathura, the spiritual sequel to this film so I deiced to give it a go. And to my surprise I was quite entertained by the film. Plot: Judy and Peter play a board game to some disastrous results. Story and direction: The film opens up with  children from  burying something and saying that whoever opens this up may God be with them. I mean this scene was basically not necessary. The film could have opened from  with our protagonist Alan Parrish. We see Alan's world where he is bullied a lot and hides in his father's shoe factory. There we are introduced to Carl who I think was not necessary for the film in the first place. Then we see Alan taking the Jumanji game to his home and opening it. in the meanwhile, we see Alan's parents deciding to send him to boarding school to which he objects and decides never to talk to them again. Then Alan and Sarah begin to play the game when Alan gets sucked into it and Sarah getting scared runs for her life. Then the film takes a  year leap, where we are introduced to  new characters Peter and Judy, who have been given a quite nice back story. They open up the game and while they playing Alan comes out of it. Then we are taken on a joyride where the try to finish the game with a now grown Sarah. Now the thing that felt awful in the film was the CGI. It felt like you were watching some big patches of imagery that were just pasted onto the screen. Then I guess the Van Pelt character. He was just too laughable for me. And was wasted a lot. And finally, the revised  version wherein some things were not explained rightly, according to me. Performances: Robin Williams made me remember that why I will be remembering him as a great actor. His comic timing was spot on. RIP Sir Williams. Bonnie Hunt was also great as Sarah. Kirsten Dunst was a great child artist in the film. So as Bradley Pierce. Favirite Scene: The scene where Alan pops up to save Peter and Judy from a lion and his joy that he has returned home after  years of being trapped in the game. Robin Williams just acted so great in this scene. Verdict: Although with some misses, Jumanji is a very much watchable film. I enjoyed my time with this movie. I am going with a ./ Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Has more depth than the book, but lacks much of its lustre; When I was in fifth Grade, I read a book called Jumanji. It was a  book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera. A year later (February or March ), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In , two young chaps bury in a chest \"Jumanji\", a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy.  years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in , but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight\"; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic , where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost... Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm. The other three characters, but the movie is so focused on the four players that everyone else looks like a decoration set. The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining . But the screenplay touches on the drama scenes so lightly that they do not create much justice to the film. The anarchic present looks like a throwback of Back to the Future II's Alternate . But all ends well at the conclusion, and people will find it likable, including those who read the book. By the way, this was the first time I heard about Kirsten Dunst... **/ out of **** Grade A Effects; This movie is the kind of movie you wouldn't want to watch when you're trying to get to sleep. This movie is lurking with action and adventure around every corner, along with some animals. Great effects, good plot, and interesting characters. A *** out of ****.</td>\n",

       "      <td>forget the fussing; As a ++ female who married again only  years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at  AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached , God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the  teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his  years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life &amp; Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau &amp; Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman &amp; John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a . out of  the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in , noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A() vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A() there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's , lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my -year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG- rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was  at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was --a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. / stars. Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from . The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment.  stars out of . Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter &amp; Jack's previous films together. It was this film &amp; the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max &amp; John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the  adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. Classic sequel, better than st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the st --. out of  for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from . The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe yrs old, and must have seen it over  x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it  minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***/ (out of four) Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. One of the best movies of !; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having  or  scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about  minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as / Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT  out of  Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. / stars - John Ulmer More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in ,  years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie  out of . The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from  is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $ of the $ that I paid to see it. I give this one  out of . Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" Hilarious in Parts;  was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in , the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for  + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those  minutes back of my life. Please. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this  film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about  or  and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. A  is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Great female flick of the 's!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track : This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no. and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops &amp; horrible movies. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in  at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four  something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker.  of  stars. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course % of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation.</td>\n",

She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the  movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the  classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the  year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $k bonus to move out in  days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a , i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September ,  - Video Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part  right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part  still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part  is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part  is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. / Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. . out of  stars. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in . It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the  sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of . This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late ''s)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie.</td>\n",

       "0  Best Film of the 's!; That film has made its first success with the most beloved buddy picture of all time! The Next Who Framed Roger Rabbit I love how they try to make something different with CGI, because all they've done in the beginning were commercials and shorts. Ever since John Lasseter saw Tron, he knew that CGI would go all over the place. And boy has Pixar nailed it! The Story has taken itself to a whole new level, it's all about getting back to a young boy by using the power of teamwork, accepting for what you are, and telling the truth in an innocent way. Woody never meant to hurt Buzz, he just wanted to spend his life with Andy. The other toys are blinded by this accident that they decide to toss their leader out like garbage. Sid is what I believe the best villain for three reasons .He's the bully for the toys .He's stuck in the mind of a mad doctor or scientist .He learns an important lesson that toys are meant to be in heaven, not in toy hell. Unless you're a Losto Bear who thinks that humans are the enemies. Man! This is the reason why people loved the 's. There was a time when animation wanted to push itself to next level. And Toy Story was one the important examples of being the greatest survivors with a lovely story, fresh start animation, amazing characters, and epic songs by Randy Newman. This could be a fresh start for those who wanna tell stories. In fact I have novel that I'm working on. It's on my Watpadd. Check it out https://www.wattpad.com/story/-meme-world Toys, a symbol of our childhood; This film tells a story of rivalry between two toys: a cowboy doll named Woody and an action figure named Buzz Lightyear. They will fight for the affection of a child from the moment that Buzz is offered to him as a gift, threatening Woody's place as his favorite toy. A rivalry that will lead to a strong friendship between them. Directed by John Lasseter, one of the brightest minds of Pixar Studios, the film features the voices of Tom Hanks (as Woody) and Tim Allen (as Buzz) for the main characters. This was the film that launched Pixar to success, in a journey that still goes and deserves the respect of all admirers of the seventh art. The story of this film is deeply moving, not only to focus on strong themes like loyalty and friendship but, mainly, because it mess with our fondest memories by involving toys that we all played when we were kids. Its not a coincidence that we see, in this film, toys of our parents and grandparents living with action figures and games of our time. This film tries to touch everyone, from the small audience to the adults who take them to the movies. It's a great movie for the family and it's still current today, twenty years after his premiere. great job; this movie was such a great family movie. My daughter absolutely loves all the toy story movies we watched every single one of them and it always gets to us. great job to the creator of the movie. I loved how my daughter reacts to the movie when her favorite part comes up. I think she seen this movie so many times she probably knows the lines already. Woody is such an awesome cowboys i think he is one of my favorite characters along with little Bo-peep and slinky. Every toy in that movie make a really good team. I thought it was mean that woody pushed buzz out the window because he was a jealous toy. But I'm glad him and buzz get along great. one of the best animated; In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present, a group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy Davis (John Morris), are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his single mother (Laurie Metcalf) and infant sister Molly are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess (Annie Potts), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex the Dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberger) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge (R. Lee Ermey), spy on the party and report the results to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift  an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who believes that he is an actual space ranger. Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie; I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about. Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys. The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys. Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film. toys are alive; ****spoiler***** All of children have some toys, for example, baby dole, teddy bear, gun and so on, but everyone doesn't think that the toys able to move, speak and have their live. If it was true, it is a little scared, but it is so interesting to image their living. But in this movie, it seem that the toys don't know that they are made by someone at first. The setting is so interesting, When BUZZ he is a new toy of his master knows that he is not a real hero, he is so depressed because he had lost his identity. But the lead character, WOODY, helps him, even if he is hated by his friends. The time when BUZZ accepts his real potential and gets over a trial with WOODY makes us exciting and it makes us forget that they are toys sometimes. This is the first successful film which is the CG animation for Disney films and the anecdote of STEVE JOBS and JOHN ALAN LASSETER will not disappear forever. Great fun, a film that's not just for kids; I wasn't too sure about this film before I watched it. The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story. The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up  something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space! Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home. Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is  years old, but I've only just seen it!). The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others  such as Mr. Potato Head  are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep  who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries! The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back. Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible. The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films  particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations. All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again. And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them? Well, now we know why! The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in  lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Fantastic animated movie for all ages.; Toy Story is a fantastic animated movie for all ages. The movies stars toys brought to life and their tiny adventures. Full of thrill, comedy and charm. Even though the computer graphics are starting to get a bit dated, it's incredibly fascinating seeing Pixars humble beginnings. This is the movie that laid the groundwork for their continued successes. The movie stars Tim Allan as Buzz Lightyear, Tom Hanks as Woody, just to name a few of the talented actors that have loaned their voices to this instant classic. I highly recommended this movie to anyone looking for a good time. Pixar's overall # best, one of the best parts of my childhood, overall best animated film, and one of the best films in general as well; Toy Story is the very first animated film ever made in history, it's the overall best and set the bar high for plenty of future computer animated films in general for a lot of good reasons. Pixar's first film takes place in a world where toys come alive when nobody is around, the story centers around a pull string cowboy doll named Woody who's voiced by Tom Hanks, he's the favorite toy of a young boy named Andy, but that changes when Andy gets a new action figure for his birthday, that particular toy is Buzz Lightyear who is voiced by Tim Allen, Buzz wins all the attention which makes Woody inevitably jealous and forces him to try to get rid of Buzz, resulting in them getting separated from Andy, therefore, they must put their differences aside and try to get back to Andy before him and his family move to their new house. With great writers like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, and Joss Whedon, the story as a whole needs nothing more and nothing less, it's just right, every scene advances the story forward. The characters are all memorable, the Pizza Planet aliens, the cowardly Rex voiced by Wallace Shawn, the know-it-all Hamm the piggy bank voiced by John Ratzenberger, the loyal Slinky-Dog voiced by Jim Varney, and the sassy and rude but always hilarious Mr. Potato-Head who's voiced by Don Rickles. But the best characters are the two main protagonists, Buzz Lightyear is a character that took a life of his own and became a pop-cultural phenomenon over night, even getting his own TV show, in fact in December  every child on the planet wanted a Buzz Lightyear action figure, which is what Buzz represents the toy we all wanted when we were kids but weren't lucky enough to get, the ultimate action hero of the ultimate hero, and on top of all that casting Tim Allen to do his voice is by far one the best voice over performances of all time. Then there's Woody, Tom Hanks' performance as the sheriff of these parts was outrageously flawless, he's an old soul and his case is quite literal, considering he is a toy from the early generation which we didn't grow up in, but he is probably the character we can relate to the most. As for the best scene, the end of the final chase scene when Buzz and Woody are flying through the air after almost being blown up by a rocket: Woody: Hey Buzz you're flying! Buzz: this isn't flying, this is falling with style! Where Buzz finally achieves what he knew he could do from the start and Woody can put his doubts aside. Get the family together and get ready to go as Buzz and Woody put it \"TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!\"  This movie was one of the best d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an ..(I gave it an ) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! G.o.a.t; I loved this film. For me, this is the best animated movie of all time. I think the story is very heartfelt and captures the relationship between a young boy and his toys really well. It has a universal message that applies to all ages: love. I think they did a great job with the range of characters, too; Each one brings a different perspective/attitude that really crosses over into real life whilst maintaining true to their toy-personality. This movie has good elements of comedy and drama, good guys/bad guys, heroes and aliens. It is a feel-good, timeless movie that will be relevant for generations to come. Good, Creative charm for kids and adults!; I'm not a huge fan of animated films, so coming into Toy Story I had very low expectations. At first, I thought it was Meh. Then, as the movie progressed it got better and better. Buzz is funny, Woody is a good cowboy, Sid is awesomely evil. Toy Story has an amazing cast as well. I mean, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, AND the Amazing Don RICKLES as Mr. Potato Head! Toy Story keeps kids and adults on their feet and I'm praising it so much because I have never seen any ANIMATED film as good as Toy Story so far. Disney really worked their magic into this classic. Toy Story FTW. I'm going to go rent Toy Story , and see if this film series has advanced even further. The one that started it all; In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In , they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be % made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history. The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having \"souls\" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was. Rating: ,/ Best Kids Movie of All-Time; When ever I here someone hating on this movie I cant believe it. What is not to like about this movie? It is a story about realizing who your true friends are in times of trouble and learning to live with what you are. This movie is something not only kids will like but their parents will love it too. I know for a while my mom liked this movie more than I did. Tom Hanks was perfect for the role of Woody and his paranoid attitude is what makes the movie what it is (morally). Change is a good thing and this movie changed everything. Even though the graphics are obviously outdated everything still works as well as it did almost  years ago! and Im feeling old.... But it is a must see for anyone i would love to buy this movie but i cannot find it anywhere, that says something. Hanks and Allen are hilarious even animated!; As if Tom Hanks wasn't talented enough...someone had the brilliant idea to animate him! Not to mention pair Hanks great sense of humor with comedic genius Tim Allen! Together, these two keep the giggles and laughs coming in this cute and successful Disney Pixar flick that spawned an even cuter sequal! Pixar's first full length movie.; This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back  years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies. Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only  when I first watched it in theaters). The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like \"Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc.\" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him. Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a \"Buzz Lightyear\" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys. Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more. I give it an / perfect movie for the whole family to watch. One Of The Great Animated Features Of The 's!; If you love Toy Story , then, you'll love this original classic!!! The first Disney/Pixar production (And, the first animated feature to be computer made) is well worth a double feature with Toy Story -of course! If A Bug's Life can knock Antz and The Prince Of Egypt out of the minds of moviegoers, Toy Story have no rivals to forget! One of a kind! - the first computer-animated film and a touching story of friendship; This movie is just awesome! Bearing in mind that this was a film from /, the quality of the realistic D animation is stunning and what a perfect way to start a new era! Just as a new form of animation comes to life, a vast number of toys magically come to life when their child-owner Andy is out of the room. Maybe that's a true-to-life symbolisation! From the word go, every single one of those toys have become so famous and iconic. Argos (especially), Toys R Us, Amazon, Woolworths and more have never, since the film's -release, been without stock of them! Like it says in the summary, it's a heart-warming story as well as a funny, super-cool movie about a pull-string ragdoll (Woody) whose popularity is short-lived as Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday as a result of new electronic toys hitting the market proving to be better than a just a ragdoll. Understandably, Woody is jealous of Buzz and can't stand his guts. He's an arrogant, self-interested toy but, more than anything else, an total, utter idiot. All the toys have their own personalities; there's Little Bo Peep who has a soft spot for Woody, Slinky Dog who likes Woody and is very friendly, Rex the world's most IRRITATING dinosaur ever, RC, the RC who revs up and down rather than talks and then there's Mr Potato Head and he is VILE! So, so mean and frequently rude. He seems to have some kind of vendetta against Woody for no reason I can think of. Then, he creates his very own campaign to destroy Woody in order to avenge Buzz when Woody's the one who has felt lonely and unwanted for so long! You'd think it'd put children off the authentic Mr Potato Head by Playskool! Oh yes and there's one more toy I didn't mention - Lenny, the toy-sized pair of binoculars. He was voiced by Joe Ranft who contributed in the story development of \"Toy Story\" and is now sadly no longer on this earth. He was killed when the speed of his car went beyond control, crashed through the wall of a bridge and plunged into the river below. The Pixar team miss him terribly... JOE RANFT - The one that started it all; Toy Story will forever be remembered as the first feature film to be fully animated by computer. Since its debut in , dozens more have joined it, including a sequel (soon to be two sequels as of this writing), as well as several other excellent films from its animation company, Pixar. However, for its unique accomplishment, Toy Story stands alone. It doesn't hurt that even beyond the technical achievement, the film is charming, well-written, and touching. The toys in question belong to Andy, who has a huge variety of them scattered around his room. The unofficial head toy is Woody, a cowboy toy who has \"been Andy's favorite since kindergarten\". Woody loves being the favored toy, but the order is shaken up when Andy receives a surprise present on his birthday: a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who causes Woody to become jealous when he begins to take over the # toy position in Andy's playtime. There's a lot of good stuff in this film: The animation, which mostly still works  years later; the voice acting, which is carried out excellently; the story, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. What gets me most about Toy Story is the way that both Woody and Buzz must grow throughout the movie. Woody has to let go of his jealousy and accept that things change when someone new enters the mix. Buzz has to learn (the hard way) that he really is a toy, but that he has a very important role as such. This is better character development than we see in some \"more mature\" films. It was here that Pixar began a long line of memorable, excellently crafted characters. Pixar has released ten feature films in the past fifteen years. Toy Story  this summer will make eleven. They've maintained a very high standard of quality during that time. It definitely helps that, with Toy Story, they were off to an excellent start. First Pixar Film, Did Amazing; I Recentely Re-Watched Toy Story And I Think That Every Time I Watch This Film, It Gets Better. This Is Basically The Plot. Sheriff Toy Is Jealous When A New, Cooler Toy Named Buzz Lightyear Came And Changed The Sheriff. Then The Sheriff And The Space Ranger Are Proceeded To Be Tortured By A Toy-Torturer Named Sid, A Boy Who Loves Giving Pain To All Toys. I Think That This Film Is One of, If Not, One of The Best D Animated Movies EVER. Some Scenes Give You The Feels, Some Get You Into The Movie. Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) Was A Masterpiece In This First Installment of The Toy Story Trilogy. Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) Was Completely Enthusiastic In This Movie. I Think Most People Think Sid Is A Toy Serial Killer. I Agree. Sid Is Completely At It With Giving His 'Pain Surgery' To Fellow Toys Who Were Tormented By His Schemes. This Movie Has A Great Plot, Gives Character Development, Chose Great Actors That Overall, Enjoyed Their Parts! This Deserves At Least A / For An Outstanding D Animated Movie In . It's a Happy Movie! Ya there's spoilers; I put this computer animated movie just on the cusp of being great. You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time..../ This DVD is part of the Toy Story  Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages. Quality animation always looks good on the big screen and this looks wonderful. This is a Buy and Hold to flesh out your collection to include 'Happy Movies' as my daughter puts it. The DVD is a solid / Awesome; A very sweet and fun movie. TOY STORY has great computer animation. A simple yet well told story is also added as well. The voice overs are top notch and everyone gets a fair share in this movie. PIXAR has done a good job placing itself on the map. Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle. Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel. A good rent. On it's th Birthday, Toy Story still soars To Infinity and Beyond!; In , Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help. They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as \"Toy Story\", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about. First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the \"I'm Mrs Nesbitt\" sequence and the \"You Are A Toy\" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies \"You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic \"To Infinity and Beyond\" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history. There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's  minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" and \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" hit the right notes by being memorable songs. Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school. Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy th Birthday. Classic!; \"Toy Story\" is one of the best animated films ever created! The movie is about Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) hating each other like no other. Buzz accidently fell out of the window and Woody is accused by all the other toys of having killed him. He has to go look for him outside so they can return to Andy's room. But they got into trouble by a toy torturer while trying to get home. \"Toy Story\" is a must-see for everybody who likes Disney and it is for all ages to watch! Followed by an amazing sequel! / stars!  \n",

The effects were groundbreaking. The movie itself is highly original. What are you waiting for! if you haven't seen this, be ready for some quality family time! why an ? Because it is simply fun and entertaining. Sure it is not a perfect movie , but this is what a movie is supposed to be. i am SHOCKED by the low rating!!! . really?, Unlike dark knight or inception, which are awful in every way, this is actually entertaining and fun. A little creepy for the faint of heart... \"kids\" but they will survive! this is in a world of its own!!!!! and it deserves far more then the . it receives id like to see it reaching a . for entertainment value only! not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is , and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats.  years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number  on The  Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number  on The  Greatest Family Films. Very good! Stupid, but fun, family adventure; Board games aren't as popular as they used to be. Before the likes of Xbox and Facebook, we had classic board games such as Go For Broke and Game Of Life. Luckily, we didn't have anything like Jumanji; a mystical board game which magically comes to life as you're playing. It sounds incredibly fun, which is what young Alan Parrish thinks, minutes before he is sucked into the game and left to fend for himself for  years. Reawakened by a younger generation, old Alan, played by the late Robin Williams, must finish the game before it engulfs the entire town. If it sounds a little ridiculous, that's because it is. But it is a heck of a lot of fun as well. Robin Williams brings his usual maniacal charm and injects healthy doses of humour when the movie threatens to take itself too seriously and a young Kirsten Dunst offers ample support as one of the younger players. But the real star of the show is the effects; we are treated to scenes of an animal stampede through the streets, a monsoon inside a huge mansion and, in a wonderful subplot, one of the players is gradually transformed into a monkey because he tries to cheat the game. It is almost  years old now so, understandably, some of the effects don't quite hold up, with the monkeys being the prime example but the premise is so much fun that you won't really mind a few dodgy effects shots here or there. It also takes a little while to find its feet, with the beginning seeming to drag on for a little longer than necessary, and the ending may be a little to sickly sweet for some tastes. But once the main plot gets going it barely stops for breath as the players have to deal with any threat that the game delivers and a big part of the fun is waiting to see what the game will spit out next. A wonderfully fun family film with plenty of thrills and a great premise. Not for + age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for  not for . Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. review for jumanji.; This  film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game  years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are + as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than  and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around  when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably  or , so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. IT's the most great movie EVER, you can't get Enough of it; I want to give this movie what it really deserve ,If i will say there is movie that i will never forget in my life ,it will be this great movie for the brilliant actor robin Williams. first of all, I want to thanks all the cast of this movie and the great director ,for bringing it to us. when I want to be refresh and happy and laugh I will watch it when I want to feel the power of love and the thriller of adventure, I will watch it , there are a lot of people how see it as for children only but its really not , it was like they know where to start and finish. this movie is for everyone its my best movie ever I give it % don't miss it original, not like any other game; I saw this when I was , and I was obsessed with it and saw it  times in the theater, and it was my favorite movie. The whole idea of slight, unhappy, -year-old Alan Parrsih (Adam Hann-Byrd-Little man Tate, Halloween H:) getting trapped in a board game in , for -years and coming back as a grown man. The idea was unforgettable to my interest in time, and I imagined my self then coming back -years old. The movie is so elaborate and original, the stampede was always my favorite, it's got such edge-of-year seat action with the Rhinos, Elephants, and Zebras crashing throught the wall at the last second, and they used the most dangerous animals possible. Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) ALan's childhood friend, and Peter (Bradley Pierce) and Judy (Kirsten Dunst, along with Alan play the game and bring Gian mosquitos, vines and a Hunter from the game. The movies also really funny especially the cop. Robin Williams Best Film; Robin Williams is a great actor who has made some great films over the years but I think Jumanji is the best. I mean, what more could you possibly ask for? It's a great idea-as a child I would have loved a board-game like that. It's certainly a very gripping movie throughout-the more the players get involved the worse things become. Before you know it elephant's and rhino's are on the loose trashing a town and there's a mad hunter lurking around too. This is one of those films which you can watch again and again and still enjoy. I recommend it highly-it has a great plot, great acting and some great scenes. Watch out for the scene with the male lion on the bed.  Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... Great fun; Robin Williams is in his element as an adult/child and with wonderful support from Kirsten Dunst, Ian Richardson playing the Englishman hunter and sending himself up nicely, the excellent children and others make this escapist adventure at it's best. Til the dice read five or eight \n",
       " Jumanji; Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in , I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in , transporting him into the jungle world for  years until two new children stumble upon its drumming. Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time \n",
       " well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects. The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be \"real\", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end. The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still childrenone had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow upand with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think. There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as \"Soulman\" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the \"adult\" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal. good original family movie; Joe Johnston's Jumanji is very good family movie that is well paced. The movie is the story of a mysterious game that involves it's players more than the normal board game. The movie begins with a young boy, Alan Parrish, finding the abandoned game. He talks the girl he has a crush on, Sarah Whittle, into playing with him. Once the game starts, chaos ensues. Robin Williams carries this movie, giving it life. The other actors do okay with the bare dialogue. Joe Johnston uses the experiences on the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies to craft a fantasy world that is believable. Though not outstanding in any way, Jumanji is a fun movie that should delight children with its action and fantasy.  out of  stars. Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for (?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\" Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a /. My first childhood film and one of my all time favorites!; I was born in  so I am one year older than but my Uncle bought a copy of Jumanji when I was in pre-school and the whole family watched it together. And after seeing the film for the first time, the story is just like a funny adventure to me and I really love it. I always sneak up to the CD cabinet to watch it again because my grandmother always gone mad every time I switch the CD player and the television. And after a several replays, the movie grown deeper to me; the message of the film and everything. Until now, I still watch the movie and still having lots of laugh. A Great Family Entertainer!; Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid & I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism & magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh & Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining & magical. It offers humor, magic & emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd & Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up! Jumanji Review; Jumanji is a film directed by Joe Johnston based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg. Now I wasn't quite excited to see the films considering the reviews. But I did enjoy Zathura, the spiritual sequel to this film so I deiced to give it a go. And to my surprise I was quite entertained by the film. Plot: Judy and Peter play a board game to some disastrous results. Story and direction: The film opens up with  children from  burying something and saying that whoever opens this up may God be with them. I mean this scene was basically not necessary. The film could have opened from  with our protagonist Alan Parrish. We see Alan's world where he is bullied a lot and hides in his father's shoe factory. There we are introduced to Carl who I think was not necessary for the film in the first place. Then we see Alan taking the Jumanji game to his home and opening it. in the meanwhile, we see Alan's parents deciding to send him to boarding school to which he objects and decides never to talk to them again. Then Alan and Sarah begin to play the game when Alan gets sucked into it and Sarah getting scared runs for her life. Then the film takes a  year leap, where we are introduced to  new characters Peter and Judy, who have been given a quite nice back story. They open up the game and while they playing Alan comes out of it. Then we are taken on a joyride where the try to finish the game with a now grown Sarah. Now the thing that felt awful in the film was the CGI. It felt like you were watching some big patches of imagery that were just pasted onto the screen. Then I guess the Van Pelt character. He was just too laughable for me. And was wasted a lot. And finally, the revised  version wherein some things were not explained rightly, according to me. Performances: Robin Williams made me remember that why I will be remembering him as a great actor. His comic timing was spot on. RIP Sir Williams. Bonnie Hunt was also great as Sarah. Kirsten Dunst was a great child artist in the film. So as Bradley Pierce. Favirite Scene: The scene where Alan pops up to save Peter and Judy from a lion and his joy that he has returned home after  years of being trapped in the game. Robin Williams just acted so great in this scene. Verdict: Although with some misses, Jumanji is a very much watchable film. I enjoyed my time with this movie. I am going with a ./ Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Has more depth than the book, but lacks much of its lustre; When I was in fifth Grade, I read a book called Jumanji. It was a  book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera. A year later (February or March ), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In , two young chaps bury in a chest \"Jumanji\", a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy.  years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in , but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight\"; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic , where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost... Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm. The other three characters, but the movie is so focused on the four players that everyone else looks like a decoration set. The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining . But the screenplay touches on the drama scenes so lightly that they do not create much justice to the film. The anarchic present looks like a throwback of Back to the Future II's Alternate . But all ends well at the conclusion, and people will find it likable, including those who read the book. By the way, this was the first time I heard about Kirsten Dunst... **/ out of **** Grade A Effects; This movie is the kind of movie you wouldn't want to watch when you're trying to get to sleep. This movie is lurking with action and adventure around every corner, along with some animals. Great effects, good plot, and interesting characters. A *** out of ****.  \n",

fussing; As a ++ female who married again only  years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at  AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached , God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the  teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his  years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life & Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau & Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman & John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a . out of  the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in , noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A() vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A() there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's , lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my -year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG- rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was  at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was --a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. / stars. Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from . The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment.  stars out of . Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter & Jack's previous films together. It was this film & the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max & John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the  adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. Classic sequel, better than st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the st --. out of  for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from . The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe yrs old, and must have seen it over  x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it  minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***/ (out of four) Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. One of the best movies of !; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having  or  scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about  minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as / Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT  out of  Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. / stars - John Ulmer More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in ,  years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie  out of . The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from  is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $ of the $ that I paid to see it. I give this one  out of . Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" Hilarious in Parts;  was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in , the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for  + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those  minutes back of my life. Please. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this  film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about  or  and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. A  is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Great female flick of the 's!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track : This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no. and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops & horrible movies. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses.

Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in  at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four  something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker.  of  stars. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course % of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the  movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the  classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the  year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $k bonus to move out in  days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a , i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September ,  - Video Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part  right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part  still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part  is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part  is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. / Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. . out of  stars. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in . It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the  sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of . This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late ''s)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie.  "

       "      <td>Best Film of the 's!; That film has made its first success with the most beloved buddy picture of all time! The Next Who Framed Roger Rabbit I love how they try to make something different with CGI, because all they've done in the beginning were commercials and shorts. Ever since John Lasseter saw Tron, he knew that CGI would go all over the place. And boy has Pixar nailed it! The Story has taken itself to a whole new level, it's all about getting back to a young boy by using the power of teamwork, accepting for what you are, and telling the truth in an innocent way. Woody never meant to hurt Buzz, he just wanted to spend his life with Andy. The other toys are blinded by this accident that they decide to toss their leader out like garbage. Sid is what I believe the best villain for three reasons .He's the bully for the toys .He's stuck in the mind of a mad doctor or scientist .He learns an important lesson that toys are meant to be in heaven, not in toy hell. Unless you're a Losto Bear who thinks that humans are the enemies. Man! This is the reason why people loved the 's. There was a time when animation wanted to push itself to next level. And Toy Story was one the important examples of being the greatest survivors with a lovely story, fresh start animation, amazing characters, and epic songs by Randy Newman. This could be a fresh start for those who wanna tell stories. In fact I have novel that I'm working on. It's on my Watpadd. Check it out https://www.wattpad.com/story/-meme-world Toys, a symbol of our childhood; This film tells a story of rivalry between two toys: a cowboy doll named Woody and an action figure named Buzz Lightyear. They will fight for the affection of a child from the moment that Buzz is offered to him as a gift, threatening Woody's place as his favorite toy. A rivalry that will lead to a strong friendship between them. Directed by John Lasseter, one of the brightest minds of Pixar Studios, the film features the voices of Tom Hanks (as Woody) and Tim Allen (as Buzz) for the main characters. This was the film that launched Pixar to success, in a journey that still goes and deserves the respect of all admirers of the seventh art. The story of this film is deeply moving, not only to focus on strong themes like loyalty and friendship but, mainly, because it mess with our fondest memories by involving toys that we all played when we were kids. Its not a coincidence that we see, in this film, toys of our parents and grandparents living with action figures and games of our time. This film tries to touch everyone, from the small audience to the adults who take them to the movies. It's a great movie for the family and it's still current today, twenty years after his premiere. great job; this movie was such a great family movie. My daughter absolutely loves all the toy story movies we watched every single one of them and it always gets to us. great job to the creator of the movie. I loved how my daughter reacts to the movie when her favorite part comes up. I think she seen this movie so many times she probably knows the lines already. Woody is such an awesome cowboys i think he is one of my favorite characters along with little Bo-peep and slinky. Every toy in that movie make a really good team. I thought it was mean that woody pushed buzz out the window because he was a jealous toy. But I'm glad him and buzz get along great. one of the best animated; In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present, a group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy Davis (John Morris), are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his single mother (Laurie Metcalf) and infant sister Molly are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess (Annie Potts), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex the Dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberger) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge (R. Lee Ermey), spy on the party and report the results to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift  an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who believes that he is an actual space ranger. Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie; I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about. Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys. The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys. Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film. toys are alive; ****spoiler***** All of children have some toys, for example, baby dole, teddy bear, gun and so on, but everyone doesn't think that the toys able to move, speak and have their live. If it was true, it is a little scared, but it is so interesting to image their living. But in this movie, it seem that the toys don't know that they are made by someone at first. The setting is so interesting, When BUZZ he is a new toy of his master knows that he is not a real hero, he is so depressed because he had lost his identity. But the lead character, WOODY, helps him, even if he is hated by his friends. The time when BUZZ accepts his real potential and gets over a trial with WOODY makes us exciting and it makes us forget that they are toys sometimes. This is the first successful film which is the CG animation for Disney films and the anecdote of STEVE JOBS and JOHN ALAN LASSETER will not disappear forever. Great fun, a film that's not just for kids; I wasn't too sure about this film before I watched it. The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story. The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up  something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space! Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home. Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is  years old, but I've only just seen it!). The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others  such as Mr. Potato Head  are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep  who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries! The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back. Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible. The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films  particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations. All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again. And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them? Well, now we know why! The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in  lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Fantastic animated movie for all ages.; Toy Story is a fantastic animated movie for all ages. The movies stars toys brought to life and their tiny adventures. Full of thrill, comedy and charm. Even though the computer graphics are starting to get a bit dated, it's incredibly fascinating seeing Pixars humble beginnings. This is the movie that laid the groundwork for their continued successes. The movie stars Tim Allan as Buzz Lightyear, Tom Hanks as Woody, just to name a few of the talented actors that have loaned their voices to this instant classic. I highly recommended this movie to anyone looking for a good time. Pixar's overall # best, one of the best parts of my childhood, overall best animated film, and one of the best films in general as well; Toy Story is the very first animated film ever made in history, it's the overall best and set the bar high for plenty of future computer animated films in general for a lot of good reasons. Pixar's first film takes place in a world where toys come alive when nobody is around, the story centers around a pull string cowboy doll named Woody who's voiced by Tom Hanks, he's the favorite toy of a young boy named Andy, but that changes when Andy gets a new action figure for his birthday, that particular toy is Buzz Lightyear who is voiced by Tim Allen, Buzz wins all the attention which makes Woody inevitably jealous and forces him to try to get rid of Buzz, resulting in them getting separated from Andy, therefore, they must put their differences aside and try to get back to Andy before him and his family move to their new house. With great writers like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, and Joss Whedon, the story as a whole needs nothing more and nothing less, it's just right, every scene advances the story forward. The characters are all memorable, the Pizza Planet aliens, the cowardly Rex voiced by Wallace Shawn, the know-it-all Hamm the piggy bank voiced by John Ratzenberger, the loyal Slinky-Dog voiced by Jim Varney, and the sassy and rude but always hilarious Mr. Potato-Head who's voiced by Don Rickles. But the best characters are the two main protagonists, Buzz Lightyear is a character that took a life of his own and became a pop-cultural phenomenon over night, even getting his own TV show, in fact in December  every child on the planet wanted a Buzz Lightyear action figure, which is what Buzz represents the toy we all wanted when we were kids but weren't lucky enough to get, the ultimate action hero of the ultimate hero, and on top of all that casting Tim Allen to do his voice is by far one the best voice over performances of all time. Then there's Woody, Tom Hanks' performance as the sheriff of these parts was outrageously flawless, he's an old soul and his case is quite literal, considering he is a toy from the early generation which we didn't grow up in, but he is probably the character we can relate to the most. As for the best scene, the end of the final chase scene when Buzz and Woody are flying through the air after almost being blown up by a rocket: Woody: Hey Buzz you're flying! Buzz: this isn't flying, this is falling with style! Where Buzz finally achieves what he knew he could do from the start and Woody can put his doubts aside. Get the family together and get ready to go as Buzz and Woody put it \"TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!\"  This movie was one of the best d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an ..(I gave it an ) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! G.o.a.t; I loved this film. For me, this is the best animated movie of all time. I think the story is very heartfelt and captures the relationship between a young boy and his toys really well. It has a universal message that applies to all ages: love. I think they did a great job with the range of characters, too; Each one brings a different perspective/attitude that really crosses over into real life whilst maintaining true to their toy-personality. This movie has good elements of comedy and drama, good guys/bad guys, heroes and aliens. It is a feel-good, timeless movie that will be relevant for generations to come. Good, Creative charm for kids and adults!; I'm not a huge fan of animated films, so coming into Toy Story I had very low expectations. At first, I thought it was Meh. Then, as the movie progressed it got better and better. Buzz is funny, Woody is a good cowboy, Sid is awesomely evil. Toy Story has an amazing cast as well. I mean, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, AND the Amazing Don RICKLES as Mr. Potato Head! Toy Story keeps kids and adults on their feet and I'm praising it so much because I have never seen any ANIMATED film as good as Toy Story so far. Disney really worked their magic into this classic. Toy Story FTW. I'm going to go rent Toy Story , and see if this film series has advanced even further. The one that started it all; In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In , they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be % made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history. The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having \"souls\" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was. Rating: ,/ Best Kids Movie of All-Time; When ever I here someone hating on this movie I cant believe it. What is not to like about this movie? It is a story about realizing who your true friends are in times of trouble and learning to live with what you are. This movie is something not only kids will like but their parents will love it too. I know for a while my mom liked this movie more than I did. Tom Hanks was perfect for the role of Woody and his paranoid attitude is what makes the movie what it is (morally). Change is a good thing and this movie changed everything. Even though the graphics are obviously outdated everything still works as well as it did almost  years ago! and Im feeling old.... But it is a must see for anyone i would love to buy this movie but i cannot find it anywhere, that says something. Hanks and Allen are hilarious even animated!; As if Tom Hanks wasn't talented enough...someone had the brilliant idea to animate him! Not to mention pair Hanks great sense of humor with comedic genius Tim Allen! Together, these two keep the giggles and laughs coming in this cute and successful Disney Pixar flick that spawned an even cuter sequal! Pixar's first full length movie.; This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back  years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies. Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only  when I first watched it in theaters). The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like \"Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc.\" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him. Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a \"Buzz Lightyear\" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys. Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more. I give it an / perfect movie for the whole family to watch. One Of The Great Animated Features Of The 's!; If you love Toy Story , then, you'll love this original classic!!! The first Disney/Pixar production (And, the first animated feature to be computer made) is well worth a double feature with Toy Story -of course! If A Bug's Life can knock Antz and The Prince Of Egypt out of the minds of moviegoers, Toy Story have no rivals to forget! One of a kind! - the first computer-animated film and a touching story of friendship; This movie is just awesome! Bearing in mind that this was a film from /, the quality of the realistic D animation is stunning and what a perfect way to start a new era! Just as a new form of animation comes to life, a vast number of toys magically come to life when their child-owner Andy is out of the room. Maybe that's a true-to-life symbolisation! From the word go, every single one of those toys have become so famous and iconic. Argos (especially), Toys R Us, Amazon, Woolworths and more have never, since the film's -release, been without stock of them! Like it says in the summary, it's a heart-warming story as well as a funny, super-cool movie about a pull-string ragdoll (Woody) whose popularity is short-lived as Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday as a result of new electronic toys hitting the market proving to be better than a just a ragdoll. Understandably, Woody is jealous of Buzz and can't stand his guts. He's an arrogant, self-interested toy but, more than anything else, an total, utter idiot. All the toys have their own personalities; there's Little Bo Peep who has a soft spot for Woody, Slinky Dog who likes Woody and is very friendly, Rex the world's most IRRITATING dinosaur ever, RC, the RC who revs up and down rather than talks and then there's Mr Potato Head and he is VILE! So, so mean and frequently rude. He seems to have some kind of vendetta against Woody for no reason I can think of. Then, he creates his very own campaign to destroy Woody in order to avenge Buzz when Woody's the one who has felt lonely and unwanted for so long! You'd think it'd put children off the authentic Mr Potato Head by Playskool! Oh yes and there's one more toy I didn't mention - Lenny, the toy-sized pair of binoculars. He was voiced by Joe Ranft who contributed in the story development of \"Toy Story\" and is now sadly no longer on this earth. He was killed when the speed of his car went beyond control, crashed through the wall of a bridge and plunged into the river below. The Pixar team miss him terribly... JOE RANFT - The one that started it all; Toy Story will forever be remembered as the first feature film to be fully animated by computer. Since its debut in , dozens more have joined it, including a sequel (soon to be two sequels as of this writing), as well as several other excellent films from its animation company, Pixar. However, for its unique accomplishment, Toy Story stands alone. It doesn't hurt that even beyond the technical achievement, the film is charming, well-written, and touching. The toys in question belong to Andy, who has a huge variety of them scattered around his room. The unofficial head toy is Woody, a cowboy toy who has \"been Andy's favorite since kindergarten\". Woody loves being the favored toy, but the order is shaken up when Andy receives a surprise present on his birthday: a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who causes Woody to become jealous when he begins to take over the # toy position in Andy's playtime. There's a lot of good stuff in this film: The animation, which mostly still works  years later; the voice acting, which is carried out excellently; the story, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. What gets me most about Toy Story is the way that both Woody and Buzz must grow throughout the movie. Woody has to let go of his jealousy and accept that things change when someone new enters the mix. Buzz has to learn (the hard way) that he really is a toy, but that he has a very important role as such. This is better character development than we see in some \"more mature\" films. It was here that Pixar began a long line of memorable, excellently crafted characters. Pixar has released ten feature films in the past fifteen years. Toy Story  this summer will make eleven. They've maintained a very high standard of quality during that time. It definitely helps that, with Toy Story, they were off to an excellent start. First Pixar Film, Did Amazing; I Recentely Re-Watched Toy Story And I Think That Every Time I Watch This Film, It Gets Better. This Is Basically The Plot. Sheriff Toy Is Jealous When A New, Cooler Toy Named Buzz Lightyear Came And Changed The Sheriff. Then The Sheriff And The Space Ranger Are Proceeded To Be Tortured By A Toy-Torturer Named Sid, A Boy Who Loves Giving Pain To All Toys. I Think That This Film Is One of, If Not, One of The Best D Animated Movies EVER. Some Scenes Give You The Feels, Some Get You Into The Movie. Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) Was A Masterpiece In This First Installment of The Toy Story Trilogy. Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) Was Completely Enthusiastic In This Movie. I Think Most People Think Sid Is A Toy Serial Killer. I Agree. Sid Is Completely At It With Giving His 'Pain Surgery' To Fellow Toys Who Were Tormented By His Schemes. This Movie Has A Great Plot, Gives Character Development, Chose Great Actors That Overall, Enjoyed Their Parts! This Deserves At Least A / For An Outstanding D Animated Movie In . It's a Happy Movie! Ya there's spoilers; I put this computer animated movie just on the cusp of being great. You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time..../ This DVD is part of the Toy Story  Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages. Quality animation always looks good on the big screen and this looks wonderful. This is a Buy and Hold to flesh out your collection to include 'Happy Movies' as my daughter puts it. The DVD is a solid / Awesome; A very sweet and fun movie. TOY STORY has great computer animation. A simple yet well told story is also added as well. The voice overs are top notch and everyone gets a fair share in this movie. PIXAR has done a good job placing itself on the map. Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle. Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel. A good rent. On it's th Birthday, Toy Story still soars To Infinity and Beyond!; In , Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help. They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as \"Toy Story\", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about. First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the \"I'm Mrs Nesbitt\" sequence and the \"You Are A Toy\" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies \"You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic \"To Infinity and Beyond\" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history. There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's  minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" and \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" hit the right notes by being memorable songs. Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school. Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy th Birthday. Classic!; \"Toy Story\" is one of the best animated films ever created! The movie is about Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) hating each other like no other. Buzz accidently fell out of the window and Woody is accused by all the other toys of having killed him. He has to go look for him outside so they can return to Andy's room. But they got into trouble by a toy torturer while trying to get home. \"Toy Story\" is a must-see for everybody who likes Disney and it is for all ages to watch! Followed by an amazing sequel! / stars!</td>\n",

       "      <td>A great movie for All ages!; Jumanji! based on the story's by Chris Van Allsburg Robin Williams is a blast! The effects were groundbreaking. The movie itself is highly original. What are you waiting for! if you haven't seen this, be ready for some quality family time! why an ? Because it is simply fun and entertaining. Sure it is not a perfect movie , but this is what a movie is supposed to be. i am SHOCKED by the low rating!!! . really?, Unlike dark knight or inception, which are awful in every way, this is actually entertaining and fun. A little creepy for the faint of heart... \"kids\" but they will survive! this is in a world of its own!!!!! and it deserves far more then the . it receives id like to see it reaching a . for entertainment value only! not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is , and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats.  years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number  on The  Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number  on The  Greatest Family Films. Very good! Stupid, but fun, family adventure; Board games aren't as popular as they used to be. Before the likes of Xbox and Facebook, we had classic board games such as Go For Broke and Game Of Life. Luckily, we didn't have anything like Jumanji; a mystical board game which magically comes to life as you're playing. It sounds incredibly fun, which is what young Alan Parrish thinks, minutes before he is sucked into the game and left to fend for himself for  years. Reawakened by a younger generation, old Alan, played by the late Robin Williams, must finish the game before it engulfs the entire town. If it sounds a little ridiculous, that's because it is. But it is a heck of a lot of fun as well. Robin Williams brings his usual maniacal charm and injects healthy doses of humour when the movie threatens to take itself too seriously and a young Kirsten Dunst offers ample support as one of the younger players. But the real star of the show is the effects; we are treated to scenes of an animal stampede through the streets, a monsoon inside a huge mansion and, in a wonderful subplot, one of the players is gradually transformed into a monkey because he tries to cheat the game. It is almost  years old now so, understandably, some of the effects don't quite hold up, with the monkeys being the prime example but the premise is so much fun that you won't really mind a few dodgy effects shots here or there. It also takes a little while to find its feet, with the beginning seeming to drag on for a little longer than necessary, and the ending may be a little to sickly sweet for some tastes. But once the main plot gets going it barely stops for breath as the players have to deal with any threat that the game delivers and a big part of the fun is waiting to see what the game will spit out next. A wonderfully fun family film with plenty of thrills and a great premise. Not for + age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for  not for . Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. review for jumanji.; This  film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game  years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are + as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than  and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around  when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably  or , so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. IT's the most great movie EVER, you can't get Enough of it; I want to give this movie what it really deserve ,If i will say there is movie that i will never forget in my life ,it will be this great movie for the brilliant actor robin Williams. first of all, I want to thanks all the cast of this movie and the great director ,for bringing it to us. when I want to be refresh and happy and laugh I will watch it when I want to feel the power of love and the thriller of adventure, I will watch it , there are a lot of people how see it as for children only but its really not , it was like they know where to start and finish. this movie is for everyone its my best movie ever I give it % don't miss it original, not like any other game; I saw this when I was , and I was obsessed with it and saw it  times in the theater, and it was my favorite movie. The whole idea of slight, unhappy, -year-old Alan Parrsih (Adam Hann-Byrd-Little man Tate, Halloween H:) getting trapped in a board game in , for -years and coming back as a grown man. The idea was unforgettable to my interest in time, and I imagined my self then coming back -years old. The movie is so elaborate and original, the stampede was always my favorite, it's got such edge-of-year seat action with the Rhinos, Elephants, and Zebras crashing throught the wall at the last second, and they used the most dangerous animals possible. Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) ALan's childhood friend, and Peter (Bradley Pierce) and Judy (Kirsten Dunst, along with Alan play the game and bring Gian mosquitos, vines and a Hunter from the game. The movies also really funny especially the cop. Robin Williams Best Film; Robin Williams is a great actor who has made some great films over the years but I think Jumanji is the best. I mean, what more could you possibly ask for? It's a great idea-as a child I would have loved a board-game like that. It's certainly a very gripping movie throughout-the more the players get involved the worse things become. Before you know it elephant's and rhino's are on the loose trashing a town and there's a mad hunter lurking around too. This is one of those films which you can watch again and again and still enjoy. I recommend it highly-it has a great plot, great acting and some great scenes. Watch out for the scene with the male lion on the bed.  Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... Great fun; Robin Williams is in his element as an adult/child and with wonderful support from Kirsten Dunst, Ian Richardson playing the Englishman hunter and sending himself up nicely, the excellent children and others make this escapist adventure at it's best. Til the dice read five or eight \n",
       " Jumanji; Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in , I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in , transporting him into the jungle world for  years until two new children stumble upon its drumming. Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time \n",
       " well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects. The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be \"real\", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end. The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still childrenone had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow upand with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think. There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as \"Soulman\" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the \"adult\" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal. good original family movie; Joe Johnston's Jumanji is very good family movie that is well paced. The movie is the story of a mysterious game that involves it's players more than the normal board game. The movie begins with a young boy, Alan Parrish, finding the abandoned game. He talks the girl he has a crush on, Sarah Whittle, into playing with him. Once the game starts, chaos ensues. Robin Williams carries this movie, giving it life. The other actors do okay with the bare dialogue. Joe Johnston uses the experiences on the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies to craft a fantasy world that is believable. Though not outstanding in any way, Jumanji is a fun movie that should delight children with its action and fantasy.  out of  stars. Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for (?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\" Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a /. My first childhood film and one of my all time favorites!; I was born in  so I am one year older than but my Uncle bought a copy of Jumanji when I was in pre-school and the whole family watched it together. And after seeing the film for the first time, the story is just like a funny adventure to me and I really love it. I always sneak up to the CD cabinet to watch it again because my grandmother always gone mad every time I switch the CD player and the television. And after a several replays, the movie grown deeper to me; the message of the film and everything. Until now, I still watch the movie and still having lots of laugh. A Great Family Entertainer!; Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid &amp; I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism &amp; magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh &amp; Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining &amp; magical. It offers humor, magic &amp; emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography &amp; Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd &amp; Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up! Jumanji Review; Jumanji is a film directed by Joe Johnston based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg. Now I wasn't quite excited to see the films considering the reviews. But I did enjoy Zathura, the spiritual sequel to this film so I deiced to give it a go. And to my surprise I was quite entertained by the film. Plot: Judy and Peter play a board game to some disastrous results. Story and direction: The film opens up with  children from  burying something and saying that whoever opens this up may God be with them. I mean this scene was basically not necessary. The film could have opened from  with our protagonist Alan Parrish. We see Alan's world where he is bullied a lot and hides in his father's shoe factory. There we are introduced to Carl who I think was not necessary for the film in the first place. Then we see Alan taking the Jumanji game to his home and opening it. in the meanwhile, we see Alan's parents deciding to send him to boarding school to which he objects and decides never to talk to them again. Then Alan and Sarah begin to play the game when Alan gets sucked into it and Sarah getting scared runs for her life. Then the film takes a  year leap, where we are introduced to  new characters Peter and Judy, who have been given a quite nice back story. They open up the game and while they playing Alan comes out of it. Then we are taken on a joyride where the try to finish the game with a now grown Sarah. Now the thing that felt awful in the film was the CGI. It felt like you were watching some big patches of imagery that were just pasted onto the screen. Then I guess the Van Pelt character. He was just too laughable for me. And was wasted a lot. And finally, the revised  version wherein some things were not explained rightly, according to me. Performances: Robin Williams made me remember that why I will be remembering him as a great actor. His comic timing was spot on. RIP Sir Williams. Bonnie Hunt was also great as Sarah. Kirsten Dunst was a great child artist in the film. So as Bradley Pierce. Favirite Scene: The scene where Alan pops up to save Peter and Judy from a lion and his joy that he has returned home after  years of being trapped in the game. Robin Williams just acted so great in this scene. Verdict: Although with some misses, Jumanji is a very much watchable film. I enjoyed my time with this movie. I am going with a ./ Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Has more depth than the book, but lacks much of its lustre; When I was in fifth Grade, I read a book called Jumanji. It was a  book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera. A year later (February or March ), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In , two young chaps bury in a chest \"Jumanji\", a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy.  years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in , but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight\"; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic , where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost... Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm. The other three characters, but the movie is so focused on the four players that everyone else looks like a decoration set. The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining . But the screenplay touches on the drama scenes so lightly that they do not create much justice to the film. The anarchic present looks like a throwback of Back to the Future II's Alternate . But all ends well at the conclusion, and people will find it likable, including those who read the book. By the way, this was the first time I heard about Kirsten Dunst... **/ out of **** Grade A Effects; This movie is the kind of movie you wouldn't want to watch when you're trying to get to sleep. This movie is lurking with action and adventure around every corner, along with some animals. Great effects, good plot, and interesting characters. A *** out of ****.</td>\n",

It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at  AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached , God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the  teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his  years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life &amp; Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau &amp; Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman &amp; John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a . out of  the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in , noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A() vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A() there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's , lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my -year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG- rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was  at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was --a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. / stars. Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from . The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment.  stars out of . Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter &amp; Jack's previous films together. It was this film &amp; the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max &amp; John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the  adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. Classic sequel, better than st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the st --. out of  for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from . The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe yrs old, and must have seen it over  x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it  minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***/ (out of four) Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. One of the best movies of !; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having  or  scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about  minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as / Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT  out of  Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. / stars - John Ulmer More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in ,  years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie  out of . The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from  is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $ of the $ that I paid to see it. I give this one  out of . Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" Hilarious in Parts;  was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in , the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for  + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those  minutes back of my life. Please. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this  film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about  or  and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. A  is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Great female flick of the 's!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track : This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no. and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops &amp; horrible movies. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in  at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four  something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker.  of  stars. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course % of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the  movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the  classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the  year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $k bonus to move out in  days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a , i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September ,  - Video Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part  right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part  still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part  is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part  is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. / Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. . out of  stars. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in . It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the  sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of . This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late ''s)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie.</td>\n",

       "0  Best Film of the 's!; That film has made its first success with the most beloved buddy picture of all time! The Next Who Framed Roger Rabbit I love how they try to make something different with CGI, because all they've done in the beginning were commercials and shorts. Ever since John Lasseter saw Tron, he knew that CGI would go all over the place. And boy has Pixar nailed it! The Story has taken itself to a whole new level, it's all about getting back to a young boy by using the power of teamwork, accepting for what you are, and telling the truth in an innocent way. Woody never meant to hurt Buzz, he just wanted to spend his life with Andy. The other toys are blinded by this accident that they decide to toss their leader out like garbage. Sid is what I believe the best villain for three reasons .He's the bully for the toys .He's stuck in the mind of a mad doctor or scientist .He learns an important lesson that toys are meant to be in heaven, not in toy hell. Unless you're a Losto Bear who thinks that humans are the enemies. Man! This is the reason why people loved the 's. There was a time when animation wanted to push itself to next level. And Toy Story was one the important examples of being the greatest survivors with a lovely story, fresh start animation, amazing characters, and epic songs by Randy Newman. This could be a fresh start for those who wanna tell stories. In fact I have novel that I'm working on. It's on my Watpadd. Check it out https://www.wattpad.com/story/-meme-world Toys, a symbol of our childhood; This film tells a story of rivalry between two toys: a cowboy doll named Woody and an action figure named Buzz Lightyear. They will fight for the affection of a child from the moment that Buzz is offered to him as a gift, threatening Woody's place as his favorite toy. A rivalry that will lead to a strong friendship between them. Directed by John Lasseter, one of the brightest minds of Pixar Studios, the film features the voices of Tom Hanks (as Woody) and Tim Allen (as Buzz) for the main characters. This was the film that launched Pixar to success, in a journey that still goes and deserves the respect of all admirers of the seventh art. The story of this film is deeply moving, not only to focus on strong themes like loyalty and friendship but, mainly, because it mess with our fondest memories by involving toys that we all played when we were kids. Its not a coincidence that we see, in this film, toys of our parents and grandparents living with action figures and games of our time. This film tries to touch everyone, from the small audience to the adults who take them to the movies. It's a great movie for the family and it's still current today, twenty years after his premiere. great job; this movie was such a great family movie. My daughter absolutely loves all the toy story movies we watched every single one of them and it always gets to us. great job to the creator of the movie. I loved how my daughter reacts to the movie when her favorite part comes up. I think she seen this movie so many times she probably knows the lines already. Woody is such an awesome cowboys i think he is one of my favorite characters along with little Bo-peep and slinky. Every toy in that movie make a really good team. I thought it was mean that woody pushed buzz out the window because he was a jealous toy. But I'm glad him and buzz get along great. one of the best animated; In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present, a group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy Davis (John Morris), are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his single mother (Laurie Metcalf) and infant sister Molly are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess (Annie Potts), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex the Dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberger) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge (R. Lee Ermey), spy on the party and report the results to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift  an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who believes that he is an actual space ranger. Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie; I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about. Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys. The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys. Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film. toys are alive; ****spoiler***** All of children have some toys, for example, baby dole, teddy bear, gun and so on, but everyone doesn't think that the toys able to move, speak and have their live. If it was true, it is a little scared, but it is so interesting to image their living. But in this movie, it seem that the toys don't know that they are made by someone at first. The setting is so interesting, When BUZZ he is a new toy of his master knows that he is not a real hero, he is so depressed because he had lost his identity. But the lead character, WOODY, helps him, even if he is hated by his friends. The time when BUZZ accepts his real potential and gets over a trial with WOODY makes us exciting and it makes us forget that they are toys sometimes. This is the first successful film which is the CG animation for Disney films and the anecdote of STEVE JOBS and JOHN ALAN LASSETER will not disappear forever. Great fun, a film that's not just for kids; I wasn't too sure about this film before I watched it. The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story. The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up  something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space! Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home. Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is  years old, but I've only just seen it!). The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others  such as Mr. Potato Head  are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep  who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries! The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back. Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible. The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films  particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations. All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again. And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them? Well, now we know why! The Beginning of a New Era of Animation; The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in  lives on today. The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details. The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz. This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them. To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved. Fantastic animated movie for all ages.; Toy Story is a fantastic animated movie for all ages. The movies stars toys brought to life and their tiny adventures. Full of thrill, comedy and charm. Even though the computer graphics are starting to get a bit dated, it's incredibly fascinating seeing Pixars humble beginnings. This is the movie that laid the groundwork for their continued successes. The movie stars Tim Allan as Buzz Lightyear, Tom Hanks as Woody, just to name a few of the talented actors that have loaned their voices to this instant classic. I highly recommended this movie to anyone looking for a good time. Pixar's overall # best, one of the best parts of my childhood, overall best animated film, and one of the best films in general as well; Toy Story is the very first animated film ever made in history, it's the overall best and set the bar high for plenty of future computer animated films in general for a lot of good reasons. Pixar's first film takes place in a world where toys come alive when nobody is around, the story centers around a pull string cowboy doll named Woody who's voiced by Tom Hanks, he's the favorite toy of a young boy named Andy, but that changes when Andy gets a new action figure for his birthday, that particular toy is Buzz Lightyear who is voiced by Tim Allen, Buzz wins all the attention which makes Woody inevitably jealous and forces him to try to get rid of Buzz, resulting in them getting separated from Andy, therefore, they must put their differences aside and try to get back to Andy before him and his family move to their new house. With great writers like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, and Joss Whedon, the story as a whole needs nothing more and nothing less, it's just right, every scene advances the story forward. The characters are all memorable, the Pizza Planet aliens, the cowardly Rex voiced by Wallace Shawn, the know-it-all Hamm the piggy bank voiced by John Ratzenberger, the loyal Slinky-Dog voiced by Jim Varney, and the sassy and rude but always hilarious Mr. Potato-Head who's voiced by Don Rickles. But the best characters are the two main protagonists, Buzz Lightyear is a character that took a life of his own and became a pop-cultural phenomenon over night, even getting his own TV show, in fact in December  every child on the planet wanted a Buzz Lightyear action figure, which is what Buzz represents the toy we all wanted when we were kids but weren't lucky enough to get, the ultimate action hero of the ultimate hero, and on top of all that casting Tim Allen to do his voice is by far one the best voice over performances of all time. Then there's Woody, Tom Hanks' performance as the sheriff of these parts was outrageously flawless, he's an old soul and his case is quite literal, considering he is a toy from the early generation which we didn't grow up in, but he is probably the character we can relate to the most. As for the best scene, the end of the final chase scene when Buzz and Woody are flying through the air after almost being blown up by a rocket: Woody: Hey Buzz you're flying! Buzz: this isn't flying, this is falling with style! Where Buzz finally achieves what he knew he could do from the start and Woody can put his doubts aside. Get the family together and get ready to go as Buzz and Woody put it \"TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!\"  This movie was one of the best d animation movies I have seen.; Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an ..(I gave it an ) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a \"family\" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet. So please, don't let my vouching in favor of this movie go to waste! G.o.a.t; I loved this film. For me, this is the best animated movie of all time. I think the story is very heartfelt and captures the relationship between a young boy and his toys really well. It has a universal message that applies to all ages: love. I think they did a great job with the range of characters, too; Each one brings a different perspective/attitude that really crosses over into real life whilst maintaining true to their toy-personality. This movie has good elements of comedy and drama, good guys/bad guys, heroes and aliens. It is a feel-good, timeless movie that will be relevant for generations to come. Good, Creative charm for kids and adults!; I'm not a huge fan of animated films, so coming into Toy Story I had very low expectations. At first, I thought it was Meh. Then, as the movie progressed it got better and better. Buzz is funny, Woody is a good cowboy, Sid is awesomely evil. Toy Story has an amazing cast as well. I mean, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, AND the Amazing Don RICKLES as Mr. Potato Head! Toy Story keeps kids and adults on their feet and I'm praising it so much because I have never seen any ANIMATED film as good as Toy Story so far. Disney really worked their magic into this classic. Toy Story FTW. I'm going to go rent Toy Story , and see if this film series has advanced even further. The one that started it all; In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In , they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be % made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history. The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having \"souls\" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was. Rating: ,/ Best Kids Movie of All-Time; When ever I here someone hating on this movie I cant believe it. What is not to like about this movie? It is a story about realizing who your true friends are in times of trouble and learning to live with what you are. This movie is something not only kids will like but their parents will love it too. I know for a while my mom liked this movie more than I did. Tom Hanks was perfect for the role of Woody and his paranoid attitude is what makes the movie what it is (morally). Change is a good thing and this movie changed everything. Even though the graphics are obviously outdated everything still works as well as it did almost  years ago! and Im feeling old.... But it is a must see for anyone i would love to buy this movie but i cannot find it anywhere, that says something. Hanks and Allen are hilarious even animated!; As if Tom Hanks wasn't talented enough...someone had the brilliant idea to animate him! Not to mention pair Hanks great sense of humor with comedic genius Tim Allen! Together, these two keep the giggles and laughs coming in this cute and successful Disney Pixar flick that spawned an even cuter sequal! Pixar's first full length movie.; This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back  years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies. Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only  when I first watched it in theaters). The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like \"Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc.\" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him. Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a \"Buzz Lightyear\" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys. Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more. I give it an / perfect movie for the whole family to watch. One Of The Great Animated Features Of The 's!; If you love Toy Story , then, you'll love this original classic!!! The first Disney/Pixar production (And, the first animated feature to be computer made) is well worth a double feature with Toy Story -of course! If A Bug's Life can knock Antz and The Prince Of Egypt out of the minds of moviegoers, Toy Story have no rivals to forget! One of a kind! - the first computer-animated film and a touching story of friendship; This movie is just awesome! Bearing in mind that this was a film from /, the quality of the realistic D animation is stunning and what a perfect way to start a new era! Just as a new form of animation comes to life, a vast number of toys magically come to life when their child-owner Andy is out of the room. Maybe that's a true-to-life symbolisation! From the word go, every single one of those toys have become so famous and iconic. Argos (especially), Toys R Us, Amazon, Woolworths and more have never, since the film's -release, been without stock of them! Like it says in the summary, it's a heart-warming story as well as a funny, super-cool movie about a pull-string ragdoll (Woody) whose popularity is short-lived as Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday as a result of new electronic toys hitting the market proving to be better than a just a ragdoll. Understandably, Woody is jealous of Buzz and can't stand his guts. He's an arrogant, self-interested toy but, more than anything else, an total, utter idiot. All the toys have their own personalities; there's Little Bo Peep who has a soft spot for Woody, Slinky Dog who likes Woody and is very friendly, Rex the world's most IRRITATING dinosaur ever, RC, the RC who revs up and down rather than talks and then there's Mr Potato Head and he is VILE! So, so mean and frequently rude. He seems to have some kind of vendetta against Woody for no reason I can think of. Then, he creates his very own campaign to destroy Woody in order to avenge Buzz when Woody's the one who has felt lonely and unwanted for so long! You'd think it'd put children off the authentic Mr Potato Head by Playskool! Oh yes and there's one more toy I didn't mention - Lenny, the toy-sized pair of binoculars. He was voiced by Joe Ranft who contributed in the story development of \"Toy Story\" and is now sadly no longer on this earth. He was killed when the speed of his car went beyond control, crashed through the wall of a bridge and plunged into the river below. The Pixar team miss him terribly... JOE RANFT - The one that started it all; Toy Story will forever be remembered as the first feature film to be fully animated by computer. Since its debut in , dozens more have joined it, including a sequel (soon to be two sequels as of this writing), as well as several other excellent films from its animation company, Pixar. However, for its unique accomplishment, Toy Story stands alone. It doesn't hurt that even beyond the technical achievement, the film is charming, well-written, and touching. The toys in question belong to Andy, who has a huge variety of them scattered around his room. The unofficial head toy is Woody, a cowboy toy who has \"been Andy's favorite since kindergarten\". Woody loves being the favored toy, but the order is shaken up when Andy receives a surprise present on his birthday: a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who causes Woody to become jealous when he begins to take over the # toy position in Andy's playtime. There's a lot of good stuff in this film: The animation, which mostly still works  years later; the voice acting, which is carried out excellently; the story, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. What gets me most about Toy Story is the way that both Woody and Buzz must grow throughout the movie. Woody has to let go of his jealousy and accept that things change when someone new enters the mix. Buzz has to learn (the hard way) that he really is a toy, but that he has a very important role as such. This is better character development than we see in some \"more mature\" films. It was here that Pixar began a long line of memorable, excellently crafted characters. Pixar has released ten feature films in the past fifteen years. Toy Story  this summer will make eleven. They've maintained a very high standard of quality during that time. It definitely helps that, with Toy Story, they were off to an excellent start. First Pixar Film, Did Amazing; I Recentely Re-Watched Toy Story And I Think That Every Time I Watch This Film, It Gets Better. This Is Basically The Plot. Sheriff Toy Is Jealous When A New, Cooler Toy Named Buzz Lightyear Came And Changed The Sheriff. Then The Sheriff And The Space Ranger Are Proceeded To Be Tortured By A Toy-Torturer Named Sid, A Boy Who Loves Giving Pain To All Toys. I Think That This Film Is One of, If Not, One of The Best D Animated Movies EVER. Some Scenes Give You The Feels, Some Get You Into The Movie. Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) Was A Masterpiece In This First Installment of The Toy Story Trilogy. Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) Was Completely Enthusiastic In This Movie. I Think Most People Think Sid Is A Toy Serial Killer. I Agree. Sid Is Completely At It With Giving His 'Pain Surgery' To Fellow Toys Who Were Tormented By His Schemes. This Movie Has A Great Plot, Gives Character Development, Chose Great Actors That Overall, Enjoyed Their Parts! This Deserves At Least A / For An Outstanding D Animated Movie In . It's a Happy Movie! Ya there's spoilers; I put this computer animated movie just on the cusp of being great. You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time..../ This DVD is part of the Toy Story  Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages. Quality animation always looks good on the big screen and this looks wonderful. This is a Buy and Hold to flesh out your collection to include 'Happy Movies' as my daughter puts it. The DVD is a solid / Awesome; A very sweet and fun movie. TOY STORY has great computer animation. A simple yet well told story is also added as well. The voice overs are top notch and everyone gets a fair share in this movie. PIXAR has done a good job placing itself on the map. Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle. Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel. A good rent. On it's th Birthday, Toy Story still soars To Infinity and Beyond!; In , Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help. They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as \"Toy Story\", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about. First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the \"I'm Mrs Nesbitt\" sequence and the \"You Are A Toy\" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies \"You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic \"To Infinity and Beyond\" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history. There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's  minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" and \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" hit the right notes by being memorable songs. Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school. Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy th Birthday. Classic!; \"Toy Story\" is one of the best animated films ever created! The movie is about Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) hating each other like no other. Buzz accidently fell out of the window and Woody is accused by all the other toys of having killed him. He has to go look for him outside so they can return to Andy's room.

The effects were groundbreaking. The movie itself is highly original. What are you waiting for! if you haven't seen this, be ready for some quality family time! why an ? Because it is simply fun and entertaining. Sure it is not a perfect movie , but this is what a movie is supposed to be. i am SHOCKED by the low rating!!! . really?, Unlike dark knight or inception, which are awful in every way, this is actually entertaining and fun. A little creepy for the faint of heart... \"kids\" but they will survive! this is in a world of its own!!!!! and it deserves far more then the . it receives id like to see it reaching a . for entertainment value only! not bad but could have been so much more; From director Joe Johnston comes this story of a jaded rich kid in the late s who stumbles upon a mystical and ancient board game that bring the primitive and terrifying elements of the jungle to life. Having become a 'prisoner' of the game, he's released decades later as an adult wherewith the help of two precocious children and a former childhood friendhe must finish the game before it threatens to overtake their world. Based on a popular children's book it follows a formula similar to that of Jurassic Park and has the potential to be something really spectacular, but it depends solely on special effects (which aren't very special) for impact. A good role for Williams, a talented supporting cast that seems to be having fun, and a script with lots of laughs do make it fun if you don't think about it too much. **½ Jumanji; I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is , and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats.  years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number  on The  Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number  on The  Greatest Family Films. Very good! Stupid, but fun, family adventure; Board games aren't as popular as they used to be. Before the likes of Xbox and Facebook, we had classic board games such as Go For Broke and Game Of Life. Luckily, we didn't have anything like Jumanji; a mystical board game which magically comes to life as you're playing. It sounds incredibly fun, which is what young Alan Parrish thinks, minutes before he is sucked into the game and left to fend for himself for  years. Reawakened by a younger generation, old Alan, played by the late Robin Williams, must finish the game before it engulfs the entire town. If it sounds a little ridiculous, that's because it is. But it is a heck of a lot of fun as well. Robin Williams brings his usual maniacal charm and injects healthy doses of humour when the movie threatens to take itself too seriously and a young Kirsten Dunst offers ample support as one of the younger players. But the real star of the show is the effects; we are treated to scenes of an animal stampede through the streets, a monsoon inside a huge mansion and, in a wonderful subplot, one of the players is gradually transformed into a monkey because he tries to cheat the game. It is almost  years old now so, understandably, some of the effects don't quite hold up, with the monkeys being the prime example but the premise is so much fun that you won't really mind a few dodgy effects shots here or there. It also takes a little while to find its feet, with the beginning seeming to drag on for a little longer than necessary, and the ending may be a little to sickly sweet for some tastes. But once the main plot gets going it barely stops for breath as the players have to deal with any threat that the game delivers and a big part of the fun is waiting to see what the game will spit out next. A wonderfully fun family film with plenty of thrills and a great premise. Not for + age; Very weak film. FX is good.... for  not for . Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see \"Jumanji\". Don't waste your time. review for jumanji.; This  film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game  years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish. Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, \"No more banana leaves.\" Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, \"I don't like the sound of that!\" There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,\"Run! It's a stampede!\" This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are + as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than  and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy Viewing Joshua Clark Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least; Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives. Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was. The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the \"remastered\" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad. That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI. The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting. That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around  when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably  or , so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be. That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not. The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film. Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun. IT's the most great movie EVER, you can't get Enough of it; I want to give this movie what it really deserve ,If i will say there is movie that i will never forget in my life ,it will be this great movie for the brilliant actor robin Williams. first of all, I want to thanks all the cast of this movie and the great director ,for bringing it to us. when I want to be refresh and happy and laugh I will watch it when I want to feel the power of love and the thriller of adventure, I will watch it , there are a lot of people how see it as for children only but its really not , it was like they know where to start and finish. this movie is for everyone its my best movie ever I give it % don't miss it original, not like any other game; I saw this when I was , and I was obsessed with it and saw it  times in the theater, and it was my favorite movie. The whole idea of slight, unhappy, -year-old Alan Parrsih (Adam Hann-Byrd-Little man Tate, Halloween H:) getting trapped in a board game in , for -years and coming back as a grown man. The idea was unforgettable to my interest in time, and I imagined my self then coming back -years old. The movie is so elaborate and original, the stampede was always my favorite, it's got such edge-of-year seat action with the Rhinos, Elephants, and Zebras crashing throught the wall at the last second, and they used the most dangerous animals possible. Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) ALan's childhood friend, and Peter (Bradley Pierce) and Judy (Kirsten Dunst, along with Alan play the game and bring Gian mosquitos, vines and a Hunter from the game. The movies also really funny especially the cop. Robin Williams Best Film; Robin Williams is a great actor who has made some great films over the years but I think Jumanji is the best. I mean, what more could you possibly ask for? It's a great idea-as a child I would have loved a board-game like that. It's certainly a very gripping movie throughout-the more the players get involved the worse things become. Before you know it elephant's and rhino's are on the loose trashing a town and there's a mad hunter lurking around too. This is one of those films which you can watch again and again and still enjoy. I recommend it highly-it has a great plot, great acting and some great scenes. Watch out for the scene with the male lion on the bed.  Parents go and see; Not many of my friends like this movie, but I think you should go and see it. it is a sort of a fantasy world. It teaches parents to pay attention to their childeren and that is a good thing. I liked the special effects and the special sounds and the humor. A must see for the family... Great fun; Robin Williams is in his element as an adult/child and with wonderful support from Kirsten Dunst, Ian Richardson playing the Englishman hunter and sending himself up nicely, the excellent children and others make this escapist adventure at it's best. Til the dice read five or eight \n",
       " Jumanji; Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in , I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in , transporting him into the jungle world for  years until two new children stumble upon its drumming. Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time \n",
       " well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects. The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be \"real\", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end. The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still childrenone had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow upand with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think. There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as \"Soulman\" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the \"adult\" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal. good original family movie; Joe Johnston's Jumanji is very good family movie that is well paced. The movie is the story of a mysterious game that involves it's players more than the normal board game. The movie begins with a young boy, Alan Parrish, finding the abandoned game. He talks the girl he has a crush on, Sarah Whittle, into playing with him. Once the game starts, chaos ensues. Robin Williams carries this movie, giving it life. The other actors do okay with the bare dialogue. Joe Johnston uses the experiences on the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies to craft a fantasy world that is believable. Though not outstanding in any way, Jumanji is a fun movie that should delight children with its action and fantasy.  out of  stars. Incredible !; I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie. The Game Is Afoot!....Rather Alive!; What if a board game actually had the power to make fantasy turn into reality?  Jumanji tries to answer that question as four people, in different times no less, must carry out a game of Jumanji, a game about the perils and dangers of the African jungle.  This is, if nothing else, a fun film.  It's not trying to win an Oscar..and its rather obvious pandering to commercialism is well-noted.  Nonetheless, the film has a life of its own amidst all the CGI effects.  I really found myself enjoying the story and the humour.  There is no cursing or sex in this one.  No real violence to speak of either, although certainly there are violent situations.  Robin Williams plays a young boy with a distant relationship with his father who gets lost for (?) years in the game and does not come back till two young kids resume the game he and a friend started so long ago.  Williams is funny, and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well.  David Alan Grier does a good job in particular as a policeman in the town trying to contend with all these loose jungle animals in the town.  Jonathan Hyde also excels as Williams's father and the board game character of Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter.  It was no coincidence that Hyde played both roles as, getting a bit psychological here, he represented what Williams subconsciously feared....his father.  The special effects are a bit much in places...a lot of overkill..yet they are always fun.  Jumanji is just one of those pictures that will make you smile, maybe shed a tear here or there, laugh, and say, \"How did they do that?\" Board Games Can Be Deadly!; This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space. Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing. The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths. I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film! Exciting and Fun!; Jumanji is a brilliant family entertainment movie, with a great cast, including Robin Williams. The plot to the movie is great and the movie is full on excitement. I hear they're making a sequel. I sure hope so. Jumanji is a highly recommended movie and I give it a /. My first childhood film and one of my all time favorites!; I was born in  so I am one year older than but my Uncle bought a copy of Jumanji when I was in pre-school and the whole family watched it together. And after seeing the film for the first time, the story is just like a funny adventure to me and I really love it. I always sneak up to the CD cabinet to watch it again because my grandmother always gone mad every time I switch the CD player and the television. And after a several replays, the movie grown deeper to me; the message of the film and everything. Until now, I still watch the movie and still having lots of laugh. A Great Family Entertainer!; Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid & I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism & magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh & Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining & magical. It offers humor, magic & emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd & Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up! Jumanji Review; Jumanji is a film directed by Joe Johnston based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg. Now I wasn't quite excited to see the films considering the reviews. But I did enjoy Zathura, the spiritual sequel to this film so I deiced to give it a go. And to my surprise I was quite entertained by the film. Plot: Judy and Peter play a board game to some disastrous results. Story and direction: The film opens up with  children from  burying something and saying that whoever opens this up may God be with them. I mean this scene was basically not necessary. The film could have opened from  with our protagonist Alan Parrish. We see Alan's world where he is bullied a lot and hides in his father's shoe factory. There we are introduced to Carl who I think was not necessary for the film in the first place. Then we see Alan taking the Jumanji game to his home and opening it. in the meanwhile, we see Alan's parents deciding to send him to boarding school to which he objects and decides never to talk to them again. Then Alan and Sarah begin to play the game when Alan gets sucked into it and Sarah getting scared runs for her life. Then the film takes a  year leap, where we are introduced to  new characters Peter and Judy, who have been given a quite nice back story. They open up the game and while they playing Alan comes out of it. Then we are taken on a joyride where the try to finish the game with a now grown Sarah. Now the thing that felt awful in the film was the CGI. It felt like you were watching some big patches of imagery that were just pasted onto the screen. Then I guess the Van Pelt character. He was just too laughable for me. And was wasted a lot. And finally, the revised  version wherein some things were not explained rightly, according to me. Performances: Robin Williams made me remember that why I will be remembering him as a great actor. His comic timing was spot on. RIP Sir Williams. Bonnie Hunt was also great as Sarah. Kirsten Dunst was a great child artist in the film. So as Bradley Pierce. Favirite Scene: The scene where Alan pops up to save Peter and Judy from a lion and his joy that he has returned home after  years of being trapped in the game. Robin Williams just acted so great in this scene. Verdict: Although with some misses, Jumanji is a very much watchable film. I enjoyed my time with this movie. I am going with a ./ Not for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.; The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as \"realistic\" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game. Welcome to the Jungle; Yes, I wanna play. I'll start by throwing the dice, a ten. Chance or destiny? Destiny, I suppose, wanted this marvel, full of spectacular visual effects for the time, to be my first movie in theaters, and it did not disappoint me at all. Very but very entertaining, with an argument as imaginative as unreal and with a spectacular Robin Williams in his best side, humorous. Also to note the small Kirsten Dunst, now become muse of Sofia Coppola. A wonderful and friendly film. Moment to remember: Every time Van Pelt (the hunter) appears on the scene, it's unforgettable. Another moment to remember: Those drums of the final scene, how to forget them. The game is still alive. Has more depth than the book, but lacks much of its lustre; When I was in fifth Grade, I read a book called Jumanji. It was a  book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera. A year later (February or March ), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In , two young chaps bury in a chest \"Jumanji\", a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy.  years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in , but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight\"; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic , where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost... Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm. The other three characters, but the movie is so focused on the four players that everyone else looks like a decoration set. The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining . But the screenplay touches on the drama scenes so lightly that they do not create much justice to the film. The anarchic present looks like a throwback of Back to the Future II's Alternate . But all ends well at the conclusion, and people will find it likable, including those who read the book. By the way, this was the first time I heard about Kirsten Dunst... **/ out of **** Grade A Effects; This movie is the kind of movie you wouldn't want to watch when you're trying to get to sleep. This movie is lurking with action and adventure around every corner, along with some animals. Great effects, good plot, and interesting characters. A *** out of ****.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 forget the fussing; As a ++ female who married again only  years ago, the romance between senior cits hit home with me. It IS possible for us older folks to find companionship, friendship, and fantastic SEX. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I know what it is like to have a child (college age) driving me insane, plus family pets underfoot, while also falling head over heels in love. I also know the pain of a parent dying with me right there. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau hit it all right on the mark. Grief, laughter, and love. It is hard to beat this combination. This movie made me laugh harder than I have in years, and that at  AM!!! Enjoy it folks!!! Our Second Visit to Wabasha, Minnesota; Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson's (Lemmon's) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John's father (Burgess Meredith). I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith's final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached , God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered. The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the  teams? - long after Grandpa's youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base. Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well. Grumpier Old Men; Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age. The Geezers Are Back; If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film. Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else. And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his  years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids. Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman. Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high. The \"Grumpier\" the funnier!; This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in \"The Odd Couple\" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of \"Maria\" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother \"Mama Ragetti\", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm \"hooked\"... Great.; This sequal is much better then the original Grumpy Old Men (which in most cases is not so with sequals).The jokes are better the plot outline is better the drama is better, this is not even comparable to the st one.Walter Matthau is exceptionally funny in this one and Burgess Meridith is just laugh out loud hilarious.You gotta love it.**** out of ****. A Grumpily Funny Sequel About Life & Love; One of the things I like most about sequels is that they give viewers a chance to see the return of their favourite characters as well as being introduced to some new faces. Walter Matthau & Jack Lemmon were the perfect choice to play Max Goldman & John Gustafson, their comedic timing was spot on and flawless. Other cast members Burgess Meredith, Kevin Pollak, Daryl Hannah, Katie Sagona, Ann Margret and Ann Morgan Guilbert delivered top notch performances. Sophia Loren as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti is lovely and hilarious, her character is new to town and when she turns the bait shop into a restaurant it makes way for pranks and the unexpected happens when Max falls in love. Many of the scenes during the film are filled with jokes and romance, one scene I found to be poignant occurs when John Gustafson goes to the couch by the lake to talk with his dad, only to discover that he's passed away. \"Looks like god remembered you Pop\" was a moving moment as it helped the two main characters to reconcile their feud once again. The film ended with yet another wedding and another prank pulled in the honeymoon limousine, Grumpier Old Men proves that you're never too old for love and laughs. I'd give it a . out of  the old men are back; In this sequel life goes on much as it usually does in Wabasha County, Minnesota, with the only notable differences being that John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are getting along all right, and that John's marriage to free-spirited Ariel (Ann-Margret) is working out quite nicely. John and Max's great obsession in life remains fishing, and both are vying to reel in a trophy fish that local anglers have been trying to catch for ages. Max is outraged when Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) arrive in town and take over the local bait and tackle shop, only to announce that they're going to close it down and open an Italian restaurant in its place. Max goes to remarkable lengths to foil Maria's plans, but John thinks that his friend needs a wife, and that Max and Maria might make a good match. Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith) seems to think he'd be a good mate for Francesca, but then again he's not known for being very fussy about women. John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are trying to work out their own plans to get married, and they might just make it to the altar if John and Max can stop interfering. Grumpier Old Men wouldn't be nothing without the two legends Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau they are classic as the two old grumps, I will sure will miss their works. \" --- a welcomed gift of laughter --- \"; As the trailing credits rolled for \"Grumpier Old Men,\" I remember exiting the theater in , noticeably dismayed and thinking, \"wow --- a whole movie devoted to recitation of colorful metaphors for the male reproductive organ --- by winners of real Academy Awards - FOR ACTING! The pricey cast includes paired couples, Ann-Margaret and Jack Lemmon, Ann Guilbert and Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack, and Sophia Loren and Walter Matthau. Although I did not see \"Grumpy Old Men,\" the core of the cast and original storyline continue in \"Grumpier Old Men,\" which is upbeat, outrageous, and a bit smug in never having to say, \"prostate.\" It does have a plot (more than collecting social security benefits), with three principal areas of contention: A. Lemmon (John Gustafson) and Matthau (Max Goldman) are retired neighbors and fishing cronies, A() vying for fabled and elusive \"Catfish Hunter\" (not the Oakland As pitcher) -- a well-traveled fishing story to establish the basic plot. And, A() there is an inter-family wedding (Hannah and Pollack), as a sidebar. B. Sophia Loren (Maria Ragetti) and her mother, Ann Guilbert (\"Mama\"), have purchased Chuck's Bait Shop, located on one of Minnesota's , lakes (home of Catfish Hunter), to convert it into an Italian restaurant. Lemmon and Matthau try to stop the change. In the process B(), Loren and Matthau feud personally, with predictable results; and B(), a defiant Guilbert is courted by Meredith (John's father, \"Grandpa\") -- with surprising and entertaining results. C. But the film's major conflict is -- will the on-camera crew (Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith, et al.) or the off-camera crew (the director, writers, etc.) gain control of the script and film? My very recent initiation to videos is the outcome of assuming the task of finding tasteful, G-rated, family entertainment for my -year old mother. In addition to ordering DVDs via the internet, I also rummage the bargain bins at Walmart -- \"Grumpier Old Men\" came home with me by mistake. Much to my chagrin, Mom loves the film (it must be due to her hearing loss), and replays it often. BOTTOM LINE: \"Grumpier Old Men,\" with PG- rating, questionable taste, and pricey cast, rallies from the bargain bin for decisive, popular victory -- well intentioned, fuddy-duddy son seeks refuge deep in the bargain bin. Buy this video for your mothers and fathers -- it will be a welcomed gift of laughter for aging parents. Better than the first one.; While \"Grumpy\" was enjoyable, I think \"Grumpier\" is the better overall movie. More attention is given to the supporting characters, the plot is slightly more complex, the lines are better, the jokes are better, and Lemmon and Matthau once again give excellent performances. Granted, this still isn't as good as it could be, but I think it's a noticeable step up from the original. I really don't get all the negativity toward it... come on, people, it's just a silly comedy. Lighten up. Speaking of negativity, another reviewer, whom I won't name here (oh all right, it's John Ulmer), seems to think this movie is nothing more than a \"shouting match,\" and is concerned about the age difference between the Old Men and their lady friends. I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around, and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT \"fortysomething.\" Believe it or not, she was  at the time, and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age (Matthau was --a pretty big age difference, true, but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your s!). I hate to chastise another reviewer like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap. / stars. Simply Wonderful!; Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie. Another Poor Sequel.; All the key players return in this thin sequel to the box office winner from . The two titled characters (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) once again cause trouble for each other and once again their lives are turned upside down when a cold Italian beauty (Sophia Loren) moves to their Minnesota town. A silly little film whose plot is never too interesting. Lemmon's and Matthau's talents seem wasted in this disappointment.  stars out of . Not As Good As The First; After the success of \"Grumpy Old Men\" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it's also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over. Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn't given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you'd expect. Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith's final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance. Close to the original; At my age, I had not seen most of Walter & Jack's previous films together. It was this film & the original were great. Great fun seeing the Max & John characters going after each other. Daryl, who I am NOT a fan of, dull in the character. The down point to the film was this side track story on getting the  adult children to marry. Scenes you can replay is always a plus to me in a film. \"Catfish hunter\". Sophia's character was good, at least smart, but the OVER marriage story line too much. The death of the \"Grandpa\" character was sad. His character was funny in both films. Like seeing the bloopers at the end of the film. Those were very good. Classic sequel, better than st-Farewell to Burgess Meredith; What I am most amazed about viewing this site are the ridiculous comments bashing really good movies.  This movie is really funny with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew in prime form.  Ann Margaret is back playing Jack's wife and Sophia Loren is sexy and funny playing Maria Righetti who wants to open a restaurante in place of the beloved bait shop that has been there for years.  The boys use every trick in the book to try to stop this restaurante from opening and Walter Matthew falls in love with her in spite of himself.  Burgess Meredith is hilarious as usual playing horny Grandpa Gustafson (Lemmon's dad)and the scene at the grocery store where he is comparing cucumber sizes with Maria's mom is classic.  Also, where he is sitting at the restaurant, getting loaded with Mama Rigetti and \"putting the make\" on her is also funny stuff.  For those of you who were bored stiff with this movie I say you are definitely a hard audience to please because I thought this movie was very funny and better than the st --. out of  for a comedy.  I think this was Burgess Meredith's final movie made prior to his death and if so, this was a fine way to finish a great career! Perfect in every way; A hilarious duo between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The graphics are what you expect from . The story line/script is fitting. Every character is believable without question. Most importantly, the comedy is pure gold. First watched this movie at maybe yrs old, and must have seen it over  x's by now. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Give it  minutes, and you'll know whether or not the movie is for you. Lemmon and Matthau are at it again!; \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John's new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***/ (out of four) Funny, but at the wrong time; It's a bad sign when the credits of a film are funnier than the film itself (especially when said film is billed as a comedy). Grumpier Old Men suffers from this condition. If you sit through the film, be sure to treat yourself to the credits, which contains some of the funniest outtakes I have ever heard. The film itself isn't perticularly bad or good. More of the same from the first. The relationships aren't really explored, it's just more kooky hijinks from some old guys. One of the best movies of !; I thoroughly enjoyed this outing, but I can readily understand all the negative reviews. Let's face it: The appeal of any movie depends almost entirely on the age of the person watching it, and there is absolutely nothing in this movie that would appeal to teenagers and people in their twenties, thirties, forties and possibly fifties. In fact, not only does the movie have no appeal to these groups, the vast majority would actually hate it. But I found this film most entertaining. And it was good to see Sophia Loren looking so alluring. I'll admit Ann-Margret wasn't quite so startlingly sexy, but she was still looking quite attractive. I wouldn't mind a date with her myself! I'd also admit that Walter Matthau tended to way over-act, but that's Walter Matthau. He always over-acts. That's his shtick! Director Howard Deutch did a pretty good job, though he tended to use far too many close-ups and was way, way over-fond of unflattering shots of Walter Matthau. I might be wrong, but at a guess, I would say his training was in TV. As a general rule, TV directors seem unable to shake off their training when they move over to the big screen. Great Performances In A Disappointingly Unoriginal Sequel; To make a good sequel requires a very delicate balancing act that few film-makers seem able to pull off. On the one hand, because it is a sequel, there has to be enough connection with the previous movie to give the viewer a sense of familiarity with what's happening. On the other hand, there has to be enough originality to the story to make the sequel worth watching. Unfortunately, \"Grumpier Old Men\" seems to fail the originality test. Having said that, this isn't a bad movie. Filled with a galaxy of old pros, it couldn't be. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess Meredith  these actors know what they're doing and they know how to hold a movie together. They do that here. The performances are excellent, and the movie's worth watching just to see the teamwork among them. It's in the story where things fall down. You can only watch a couple of old men insult each other for so long before it becomes tiresome. John (Lemmon) and Max (Matthau) already spent the entire first movie doing that. \"Grumpy Old Men\" was a very funny movie, but listening to them call each other \"Putz\" and \"Moron\" has lost its appeal, quite frankly. Like the previous movie, the men of Wabasha are fixated on fishing, and they're still intent on catching \"Catfish Hunter\"  a giant catfish who lives in the lake. Like the original, a beautiful woman (Loren) shows up in town and distracts everyone from the fishing business at hand. It all seems too familiar. Then, where there does seem to be promising originality, it ends up not being sufficiently developed. I thought that the budding romance between John's dad (Meredith) and Maria's mother (Ann Guilbert) had comedic potential, but the two ended up only having  or  scenes together, and the \"stop the restaurant\" campaign could have been (and seemed for a moment as if it was going to be) the comedic centrepoint of the movie, but in the end, all we got was about  minutes of what were essentially vignettes of the various things John and Max tried to do to stop Maria. The romance between Max and Maria was not as interesting as the competition for Ariel (Ann-Margret) in the first movie, because there wasn't any competition for Max, and the other highlighted story was the romance between Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and, to be honest, I just didn't care much about them. I give the movie credit for the wedding twist at the end which I have to confess I didn't see coming, and the cast did a great job. Unfortunately they can only work with the story they're given, but on the strength of the good performances, I'll rate this as / Good sequel; Good comedy with simple story enhanced by a legendary cast.This sequel was done better than \"Grumpy Old Men\" and has a funnier script although does not work unless one sees the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\" first which one may not like unless one is fammiliar with the lead actors.Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren look so good for their age and really help brighten this movie.Could have been  better with a better screenplay and story.Only for big comedy fans who are fans the past works of the lead actors here..... Funnier old B***ards; This really is a pretty good movie and one I enjoyed much more than other comedies with what they call new talent or something like that. Also I must say I enjoyed this more than Grumpy Old Men, because it was just funnier. I really liked this one, you know, old men nagging and cursing, hating each others guts while they actually like each other. It is a good story about life how it is and can be when you are old. BIG, FAT  out of  Grumpier than the First = Worse than the First.; \"Grumpy Old Men\" didn't work for two reasons. One, it was an unfortunate shouting match cashing in on the film's stars' earlier coupling, \"The Odd Couple,\" and without witty material like their original pairing, the film sank low. Two, it was boring. Now we have a sequel, even worse than the original. It is all about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon arguing, still, after the mutal agreement at the end of the original. But this time they are arguing because Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and Matthau's son (Kevin Pollack) are gettin' hitched. This is bad for the two men, because that means they will be loosely related, I suppose. Anywho, they bicker some more, and we see Jack Lemmon posing nude in one scene (carefully covered by the camera), which I could live for the rest of my life without seeing. They are also arguing because Matthau is in love with a new Italian woman (Sophia Loren) who has just moved in, opening up a restaurant taking place of \"Chuck's Bait Shop.\" The inhabitants of Grump Land don't like this, because the customers will scare away the fish, so they start pulling mean tricks and pranks on poor Sophia. \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the name of this film, as if you didn't already know, and it truly is grumpier. It's worse than the first (hey, that ryhmes) and as I snored I was bored at the sight of this tripe that has scarred my brain for the rest of my life. If you didn't pick up on that sentence, this is what I'm saying: this film is an utter bore from beginning to end, with basically no laughs. At all. And something else worth noting: Isn't it funny how out of all the eligible bachelors out there, the women in the \"Grumpy Old Men\" films seem to go straight for the oldest men in town? Walter Matthau is in his seventies here, and the woman he's dating is about forty-something. It's even worse than Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship--Grump relationships are an outrage! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a good comic pairing, but as I said in my review of \"Grumpy Old Men,\" film executives seem to see \"The Odd Couple\" as a shouting match, when it was so much more. So now studio execs seem to think that if they get these two actors to shout on screen, the film will be good. Wrong! The charm of their \"Odd Couple\" pairing was due to deep, three-dimensional characters, witty dialogue and tons of laughs. Here we just get shouting, and that's the film's major flaw. / stars - John Ulmer More comedy classic with the actors/actresses; Grumpier old men i think is another comedy classic movie. This movie was made in ,  years after when Grumpy old men was released. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann Margret are back in another comedy squeal. I give this movie  out of . The return of moron and puts; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are still the grumpy old men in this lovely sequel.John Gustafson (Lemmon) is still happily married to Ariel(Ann-Margret).But Max Goldman's (Matthau) only joy in his life is fishing with no woman.But things start chancing to Goldman with the new comer in town.Sophia Loren plays an Italian waitress called Maria Ragetti.Loren is hot in her role.Too bad she's too old for me. The late Burgess Meredith can still be seen as Grandpa Gustafson.And he's not leaving without romance either.He finds the romance with Mama Ragetti (Ann Morgan Guilbert).Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah are also replacing their roles.Grumpier Old Men from  is a lovely romantic comedy with the brilliant comedy couple Mr Lemmon and the late Mr Matthau.These two know how to make you laugh.And who could forget Burgess Meredith as the grumpiest old man.This movie offers you lots of great moments.Many moments of laughs.Grumpier Old Men is a must see for the fans of Lemmon and Matthau.They won't let you down.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     WHINE! WHINE! WHINE!; With all the hype surrounding \"Waiting to Exhale,\" I was looking forward to renting it on video.  It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong, independent African-American women. But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women. I can understand them being upset, even furious, with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other African-American women. Not to make light of the issues of racism, adultery, or divorce, but I can image Bernadine saying, \"Hey, Savannah, I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!?\" (Apologies to those who may take offense). Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book, I realize that this is merely an adaptation - or, for Terry McMillan's sake, I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine, as well as the supporting cast, are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface, but I've wasted enough time on this movie. \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons (sp) with three different women, one of which is Rochon, is a far superior movie and worth at least $ of the $ that I paid to see it. I give this one  out of . Total hypocrisy; As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of \"those bad, bad males\" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women \"strong...\" I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's \"groundbreaking.\" Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine gave John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) his comeuppance and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heartwarming, touching, and romantic movie, I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. The Book was Better; The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times! Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could've gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn't. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance! As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker's my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it. Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\" Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\" Hilarious in Parts;  was a year of the awakening of women, in general. At least an awakening that they were in an era where they were not beholden to be 'like momma'. I never saw this movie on the big screen. That was probably because it came out only two years after I had ended my own affair. I suppose that, in , the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end, as became my lesson in life, the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So, watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process, I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is, therefore, while old and not a break down the door to see event, worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogant/insensitive like that' reflection A decent movie that could have been better; Basically a movie about black women who whine about their unsatisfying relationships . Angela Basset is the shining star here, she is wonderful to watch and a very talented woman but she alone cannot hold this movie together .  i have never read the book but from what ive heard about it , its much better than this movie .. I dont get whitney houstons character , she sleeps around and calls men pigs yet shes screwing around with a married man and lela rochon is also with a man who has a wife. why would you stay with men like that. only person who acts real is angela basset's character who gets unceremoniously dumped for a white woman by her husband and reacts believably ,,  its a decent movie that could have been better . hacking; i have an expert who is reliable in the game,i met him through a contact named Jessica and was scared at first to give a trust,after all i had encountered with previous hackers but glad to say didn't regret my actions as hotcyberlord@gmail.com helped me hacked into my ex phone and gave me proof i been in a lying ass relationship all along,i will forever be grateful to you hotcyberlord@gmail.com,please contact him and tell him from Brenda as i owe him all my life for saving me at the moment. This movie made me cry.; This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for  + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about \"most\" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time! Male bashing at its finest; If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest. Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys. The acting was bad. The story was ludicrous. Every scene was basically the same. A conversation among several women about how bad men suck. So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem. Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one. I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this. I'd love to have those  minutes back of my life. Please. pure unadulterated drivel; do you read harlequin romances? danielle steel? do you in cessantly read women's magazines to find out  how to please your man? do you hinge all happiness on having a man in your life? is your IQ equivalent to your age? then you will love this movie. Looking For Love in All The Wrong Places; Looking for love in all the wrong places \"Waiting to Exhaled\" depicts four black females who have special friendships. The movie shows each one of the women trying to find true love. Each character has a different situation going on in her life as they are trying to find true love and happiness. The first character named Bernadine (Angela Bassett) was married until her husband left her for his white secretary. Bernadine was very upset about this. The next woman named Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is divorced and raising a son on her own finds out her ex-husband whom she still had feelings for is gay. She later finds a new interest in a next-door neighbor. Robin (Lela Rochon), the third character, has a relationship with a married man. Robin always wanted him to leave his wife, but she did not need him after he did finally leave his wife. Savannah (Whitney Houston), the last woman, had a mother who was trying to make sure her daughter's life is not without a man. Even if the man was married and had a child, her mother did not seem to mind. Director Forest Whitaker shows modern day women in this  film. The main message is finding out that true love is hard to find. I did not like that these women seem to have to think that married men were the answer to finding happiness. I feel that they finally found that friends can bring happiness as can being happy with your self. You cannot depend on someone else for your happiness. You have to find that from inside yourself. This film taken from Terry McMillan's best selling novel I enjoyed. This film used very beautiful black women as their characters. Each woman was unique. They were dressed in very glamorous outfits. I really enjoyed Bernadine as she cleaned out her husband's closet and her victory in divorce court. Hilarious; This is a hilarious, classic movie.  I mean with lines such as: Get your stuff and get out...it's great.  This movie is a mainstay on Bravo! and I make sure to catch it when I can.  I read the book when I was about  or  and I liked it, but I really love the movie, maybe because I see it less as a reflection of the book and more as a kind of extension.  The next time you watch it, just look for the humorous aspects (even in the serious scenes) and believe me, you will better appreciate this movie. A  is generous; It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women. Meh.; I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off... This movie is GREAT!!!!; Well, what a nice way to put a movie together about the lives of four African-American Women. It runs through some pretty common obstacles in women's lives today.It did seem a bit comical in some situations though. All of the actresses portray their characters well. With Whitney's business minded and Basset's strong, no mess taking characters, you can't help but to love the movie. This is probably Whitney's best performance, and I recommend this movie to anyone, male or female of age. The movie is not focused on bashing on degrading men, but on the empowerment of women. Many women can use a movie like this to give them the strength to leave unhealthy situations, such as cheating husbands. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses. My favorite parts of this movie were when Bernadine got back at John (Michael Beach - INTERNAL AFFAIRS) and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen (Kelly Preston - FOR LOVE OF THE GAME) if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts really made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT.

You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. An honest portrayal of relationships in society today; Overall I thought this was a good movie. What some fail to realize is that although this seems to be a \"Male Bashing convention\", it in fact accurately portrays what has become very common outcomes of a lot of relationships now-a-days. Now, I don't say that just men cheat or are all in all bad people, but the fact remains that there are a ton of situations just like the ones in this movie. I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie. The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these, that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and \"Exhale\" instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath. Yes, there may be characters that may are a bit extreme, but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way. I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with, it would be OK was a bit too far, but then again, there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't, there are some that do. I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in. It shows friends supporting friends which is a great aspect to have. I thought it a very good movie and motivational to people on the outside in these types of situations. Great female flick of the 's!!!; This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. This movie is about four women who find strength through their rare and special friendship. One woman, Bernadine (Bassett) thought she had love in her life until she found out from her husband that he was leaving her for a white woman (Whoa, hello!! He told her this on New Year's Eve!! He's no gentleman there!), and got back at him. When I first saw the scene where she cleans out her husband's clothes closet (while throwing a screaming fit) and burns them in his car, I thought it was so funny. She really got back at him. There was another scene where she went to his workplace to talk to him by interrupting a meeting he was conducting, walking up to the white gal he's seeing, asks her if she can have a few minutes alone with him, and slapping her in the face in everyone's presence without waiting for an answer, and then goes off on him. Talk about getting revenge; she had guts!!! Gloria (Devine) was so sweet as the lady with her hairdressing place and trying to deal with her teenage son, and getting romantically involved with a man that moved in across the street. Robin and Savannah (Rochon and Houston) were the ones successful in business, but their love lives were down to almost nothing. I don't care what anyone thinks of this movie. It is truly worth watching. I think Whitney Houston was marvelous in her role as Savannah. The soundtrack album to this movie is okay; I only like the Whitney tracks, especially the first one Exhale (Shoop, Shoop), which has a neat easy listening sound to it. I DO NOT like the track done by TLC (Track : This is How it Works). That is an inappropriate song to listen to. I know what the lyrics of that song describe, and I won't get into it. Anyway, get this movie and prepare yourself for some laughter and a few tears here and there. If you want to get the soundtrack, too, that is fine. But don't try to get hooked on the TLC track, though! Good movie; This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no. and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting.  IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops & horrible movies. Mediocre film about jealous, spiteful women; I did not find this film to be particularly enjoyable.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare.  However, the film didn't seem to have anything that appealed to me.  It appears to be about a group of women who become bitter and spiteful when their husbands leave them.  Then they sit around talking about how all men are terrible.  While one can sympathize with the women for being upset, they quickly become extremely unsympathetic. The whole point of their conversations seems to be that women are superior to men, because a woman would never do such evil things.  Additionally, the main focus of their concern seems to be that the men have left them for white women.  I thought these ideas of racial purity went out with the civil rights movement.  One almost senses that they wouldn't have minded so much if they'd been replaced by other black women.  I was also irritated by the one woman's burning her husband's possessions after he left her.  I realize she's angry about the whole situation, but that destruction is very childish.  Her first thought was probably to burn him, but she felt that burning his things would be better, particularly since he'd be alive to suffer. I was generally disappointed by the film and frustrated by the characters. I would never have considered it to be a comedy, although I'm sure I would have liked it better if it had been funnier, since that would have softened the impact of the unappealingly bitter and spiteful nature of the women. As it was, however, the film did nothing but irritate me. Sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie; In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE PREACHER'S WIFE) looked very beautiful in their fancy dresses.

Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"When I said that this was a 'sweet, funny, tear-jerking, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie,' I only cried on the inside.\" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Could be better; The movie is okay, mediocre might even be the word to describe it. I have to say that you can really tell who can act and who can't. Angela Bassett was brilliant in her portrayal of an angry, heart broken wife, whilst Whitney Housten seems rather emotionless throughout the film- and no i'm not only saying this because she's a singer. Furthermore, i don't understand why all black movies have to include such explicit sex! I mean the normal amount is good.. but this is too much.. I don't mean the frequency of it , but the way that sex is portrayed. It's bad because all it does is feed thriving stereotypes about black people which aren't necessarily true. Welcome to Arizona... where there are no Hispanic people!; Honestly, I didn't hate this movie as much as most others on here, but it does have some considerable flaws. Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in  at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot.... The story deals with four  something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters. The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours. Not a bad feature debut from director Forrest Whitaker.  of  stars. Soap Opera; Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course % of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her. Black people; If you know black people, especially black women, this is a very entertaining, realistic and adult movie. Angela Bassett is playing to the utmost. Her style is superior. This movie has told me a lot about modern people,  and my own situation.  \n",

   What were you thinking Diane?; I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind.  Ever since watching Diane Keaton in \"The First Wives Club\", I fell in love with her.  She is a brilliant actress and a somewhat strange individual which makes her very compelling.  The sad part about it is, not even she can save this movie. I really enjoyed the first \"Father of the Bride\" but found this one to be almost annoying.  The movie was very predictable and humorless.  Steve Martin was very disappointing....so sad... Enjoyable and Re-watchable; I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)! not as good as the first; A little like the first but far from the grand design that the first brought, Father of the Bride Part II is a loose remake of the  movie, Father's Little Dividend. Father's Little Dividend is a sequel of the  classic Father of the Bride. This movie is full of the old cast from the  year ago movie that brought us all smiles Father of the Bride, which stared Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. This sequel has all the old cast, Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, Martin Short, George Newbern and Kieran Culkin. Eugene Levy who played a minor role (just featuring in one scene) in the first movie as a wedding singer who was auditioning to be in the wedding, was given more screen time this time, as he plays Mr. Habib. Although fun and the plot smile able at, while watching this remake I didn't feel like I did in the first, were I was wishing that I was the family, the whole chaos of two child birth was more overwhelming to me the viewer not to mention George. Disney's decision to further make a part two was based on the financial return that the first part brought. Although this part two didn't make as much money as the first, but it is a good addition if you desire to see what happened to the Banks family and how Annie carried on. The movie plot starts like the first with George Banks (Steve Martin) giving us a narration about what led to what. After Annie (Kimberly Williams) and Bryan (George Newbern) got married, the next best thing that all couples desire is a nest and the desire to fill the nest with pitter patter of little feet. Well God finally answered their prayers, as Annie was pregnant with she and Bryan's first child and George has been swung into the pool of grandfathers. George, an enemy of change starts to panic and started acting all young to prove to himself and others that he was not old enough to be a grandpa, well he also got his wishes as Nina (Diane Keaton) too got pregnant. So The Mother of the Bride and the Bride are both expecting a bundle of joy each, taking George's over reacting behavior off the roof. Martin Short and his companion were brought back but their inclusion was not as heartwarming as their presence was in the first. Well after you have seen the first, you will be tempted to see the second and you should, but don't expect too much of the smiles the first delivered, but it is a nice watch a good fun time for you and the family. www.lagsreviews.com like this even less; George Banks (Steve Martin) has to deal with becoming a grandpa after his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) announces that she's pregnant. He has a midlife crisis and put the house on sale. Mr. Habib (Eugene Levy) offers top dollars and a $k bonus to move out in  days. Then the Banks family is shocked again when Nina (Diane Keaton) is also found to be pregnant. Habib is demolishing the house and George agrees to buy back the house for $k more. Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) is also back in this one for some reason. The parts that I liked about the first movie are diminished. The family drama is no longer so cute or true. It's silly without the heart. They bring back Franck who I disliked and double down on it with Mr. Habib. The whole house sale is bad. When did Franck become a construction contractor? The only improvement is that they didn't try to confuse the public by naming it 'Father's Little Dividend'. great movie; this movie is hilarious and even better than the first one. steve martin and martin short are soo funny and its a great movie. eugene levy is great as mr. habib. haha a , i love it. the scene going to the hospital is hilarious. \"hey man, whats with that face huh? is that supposed to be me? do u have a problem, loser? we have no problem with anyone just leave us alone! leave u alone, what are u a tree? haha very good ur obviously a comedian, very good just nobody look at them...etc lol Average sequel; This average sequel rehashes too many of the old \"pa can't cope\" jokes. Some of the new material works better, however comic Steve Martin and his support cast never manage to make the film feel fresh. Even frantic Martin Short is unable to inject the frivolity needed. Others returning include Diane Keaton (who never gets to do enough to show her immense talent here), Kimberley Williams and George Newbern. The show finally caves in on itself when director Charles Shyer and co-writer Nancy Myers try to cram in too many coincidences. Adapted from the \"original\" sequel \"Father's Little Dividend\". Saturday, September ,  - Video Kind of ridicules, but still a fun film; The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel. The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part  right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too \"coincidental\" and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part  still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable. George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard. Father of the Bride Part  is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself. Steve Martin, I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time, poor guy. Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round, he and Steve, when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor, Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny. Fater of the Bride Part  is worth the time and look, it's a cute movie over all. / Just As Unnecessary As Its Predecessor.; Mediocre sequel to its equally disappointing predecessor has Steve Martin going through a mid-life crisis after he learns that his daughter (Kimberly Williams) is pregnant. Things get more complicated for Martin as he learns that wife Diane Keaton is pregnant as well. Martin selling the house to foreigner Eugene Levy and the annoying appearance of Martin Short do nothing to help out uninspired direction and a corn-filled screenplay. Minimally successful in the end. . out of  stars. Quit Standing On My Shutters!!!!!!; That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don't trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that. Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn't a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written. If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie. A nice, feel-good movie, though you have to suspend credulity; I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.  One of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen; FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. Sequel to Father of the Bride adds to the depth of George's character and family ties; The original Father of the Bride had some \"laugh till it hurts\" moments, especially in the beginning, that are lacking in this sequel, though there are a good bit of chuckles. But there are some very moving moments in the sequel that brought me to tears and the character of George matures and deepens throughout. You come away liking and respecting him more as well as his family and its values. For example, the movie portrays married life as good, despite the partners' failings, and babies as a gift to celebrate, even if inconvenient. Memories have value too, and life often hands you a different deck than you planned to play. Though in both movies the Father/Daughter relationship is prime, in the sequel we get a better sense of George and Nina's relationship and moments that tug at your heart one minute and then make you smile the next. There are character flaws for sure in this movie. There are some awkward moments not suited for kids. Not all decisions that each makes may be ones you agree with, but the family members learn to be there for each other in the best way they know how. I enjoyed this movie more the second time than the first, which was many years ago. Maybe my own increased maturity allowed me to appreciate this movie in a deeper way. Diane Keaton is just so perfect in her role as Nina, and Steve Martin does his part well, as usual. All other characters are OK but I was not impressed with Martin Short's character (Franck Eggelhoffe). The strange, unidentifiable accent and personality was just too over-the-top unbelievable. Pure Enjoyment; Sometimes a little far fetched,(Like the situation about selling the house) but most of the time right on the mark.  Steve Martin is wonderful and Diane Keaton plays her role perfect.  Suporting case enjoyable.  Very good sequel to Father of the Bride. Funnier than the first one; I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women. No, the Slapstick family; I'm probably overly biased against this movie because I think any film with Martin Short in it immediately falls into the slapstick category.  And this one didn't change that opinion. Although I think Steve Martin and Diane Keaton did a fine job, Short does put much of this movie into slapstick category. George Banks' Life is Changing; Upon the twentieth anniversary of Father of the Bride II, I have always wondered what happened to George and Nina Banks. Did their new daughter grow up and get married already? Did their grandson go to college? Did their oldest daughter get divorced? How about Matty? These are some of the questions fans have asked themselves since this film was released two-decades ago. Steve Martin was masterful as George Banks, the sometimes neurotic father and patriarch. Diane Keaton was still wonderful as Nina. And Annie? Kimberly Williams played her. Kieran Culkin was the adorable Matty. But to have a child at the same age that you become a grandparent! Imagine how life changing that was for George and Nina. Its now more common for this occurrence than it was in . It was outrageous back then, crazy even. Imagine if they were to make a third Father of the Bride. I would love to see the Banks' family story continue. Makes you happy; This movie makes you feel happy, it's very warm and a very good movie...I saw it a couple of years ago for the first time and I loved it. If you don't like sentimental movies, this is not a movie for you, but I can guarantee a good laugh and a happy feeling inside after you've seen it!!! And whom may I ask is the father?.....; George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a trigger for a kind of resurrection of his attitude on life when he and his wife find how their lives are about to change as well..... The first movie was a huge hit, so a sequel was inevitable because at the time, Hollywood had a penchant for greenlighting sequels to sleeper hits. See also, Waynes World, Beethoven, and Sister Act. And thankfully, along with WW, this is one of the better blatant cash ins. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this, because Meyers has gone for the old 'If it ain't broke' way of filming, more of the same. There are references to the first film, The Dogs not liking George, the over emotional Father In Law, and of course Frank, the clown of the movie, used to even better effect than in the first. It's all been done before, but it's still a nice little film for all the family. Mostly harmless guilty pleasure; While no where near the quality of Father's Little Dividend, the Spencer Tracy vehicle that was the sequel to the original Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II is not the worst way to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. The plot follows a fairly predictable series of events with little by way of character development. The actors are talented and that makes all the difference. I can't help but find myself tearing up every darn time I watch this schlock-fest. I am rather amazed however that no reviewer has commented on the unnecessarily negative portrayal of \"Mr. Habib\" (a cameo by Eugene Levy) as the arrogant, misogynistic Arab who buys the Banks' beloved home. With both Keaton and Martin well known for their liberal politics, I'm surprised neither objected to this tired depiction of a Southern California real estate trope. Shocking; This film is proof that sequels should never be made to comedies.  Its plot is mind-bendingly thin, with poor acting all round and is swimming with ridiculous ideas (indeed the main idea that the mother and daughter could be pregnant at the same time is stretching it a bit). My advice - do not watch this film, unless you like being bored out of your mind. I will never get tired of this movie!; After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this. Better than the original; \"Father of the Bride, Part II\" is actually a remake of the  sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\", which is turn is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\". All of the principle cast members from the original film return with more outrageous situations and more laughs. George Banks (Steve Martin) is just getting over the wedding of his daughter (Kimberly Williams) when he has even more distressing news, she is going to have a baby! This doesn't settle well with him considering he feels old and is not ready to be a grandfather. Not only that, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant! Talk about a wacked situation! This not only makes George a grandfather but also a father at the age of . This movie and the original \"Father of the Bride\" are two of my favorite movies of all time. They are both dramatic, heartwarming and funny. One thing I like is the fact that it continues the storyline very smoothly with references from the first film and Diane Keaton has a lot more to do in this. Martin Short also returns as the wacky ex-wedding coordinator who now coordinates baby showers, lucky for the Banks family! Rent the original and this one for a night of humor and drama, and for anyone who is having a baby, make them watch this! Steve Martin is great in this movie.; As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star. This Feels Like SNL in the Maternity Ward; George Banks is probably the least likely character for Sympathy of the Year Award. He has a well-behaved son, a wife who he's still very much in love with, a wonderfully healthy daughter who knows where she's going, and a decent and hard working son-in-law. What is it that spearhead's his journey into mid-life crisis? The twin-occurrence of pregnancies in his wife and daughter. The question on George's mind isn't: What's it going to be like raising an infant at his age (late ''s)? It's: Can he make it through these two pregnancies? He's put to the test through the big issue of his daughter's job relocation, his wife's mood swings, \"false alarms\", sleeping pill mishaps, and various antics of the interior decorator who literally drives him up the wall and barely to the hospital when both his wife and daughter go into labor at (practically) the same time. Embarrassing at first but always outrageously funny and a little dramatic at it's conclusion. Very entertaining. And Jane Adams is amazing as the doctor who delivers George's baby. And Martin looked horrible in his brown hair. And I recommend this movie if you're mature enough to handle such a heavy dose of amusement added to this topic. And I should go now... Just a nice movie.; George Banks finally thinks that he has the freedom that he always wants. His daughter is grown up, his son is almost there and he is planning on moving to the beach. Then his daughter tells him something but he can deal with it but his wife tells him the same thing and he nearly passes out. He doesn't understand how it could happen and so he has to change his whole entire life. I think that this is a funny, cute, nice movie. I watched it when I was in a bad mood and it cheered me up right away. I liked that crazy guy that designed the nursery. He was funny so watch this movie because it's just a \"feel good\" type of movie.  "

    "Creating our custom tokenizer, we are using several components that make up how it works. First we are importing stopwords which are commonly occuring words in the english language that will be filtered. The tokenizer also incorporates stemming, a way of cutting up words allowing for the root word to show, this allows for less variability or confusion when words can very much mean similar in context of a good or bad review (for example, mess, messy, and messiness). The tokenizer also filters out punctuation to avoid having random punctuation that does not convey any meaning in our word analysis."

       "      <td>A Spielberg Styled 'Family' Horror Film!; This is not a \"Monster on the Rampage\" monster film, but is squarely in the mode of Steven Spielberg's focus on family-in-peril / search for family themes that are found in virtually all of the science-fiction films Spielberg has written or produced, from 'Jaws' () up to his masterpiece 'War of the Worlds' (), both of which are highly suggested by this film. It's the story of a three generation Korean family and how they 'grow up' and adapt to a severe crisis. The crisis happens to be a giant fish-frog type monster (a product of river pollution, which lives in the Han River and its sewers) which snatches the family's youngest grandchild. This is not a kiddie film, but one that can appeal to everyone, because the focus is squarely on the individual family members and how they adapt to the crisis. As such, it may seem boring to Monster Fans, but so what. This is a well made film. In the amazing beginning, we are introduced to the hardworking grandfather, his two sons and daughter, and his granddaughter. The father is a lazy dead beat dad, the other brother an alcoholic, and the daughter a bow and arrow Olympian who chokes up and loses the gold. Then, the monster, huge and really a gross out, attacks the river bank and starts eating people and snatching the granddaughter, before leaping, frog like, back into the river. Wow! What a beginning! Others may become disappointed that the movie is not totally played for monster scares, but instead focuses on the family members and their quest to recover the granddaughter. This comprises most of the film, but if you just go with it, you'll enjoy it; especially watching it the second time, knowing how carefully this film has been constructed. I give it an . Humorous note: For fun, turn on both the English dubbing and the English subtitles. They frequently don't match and are completely different! Loses something in the translation...yet creativity carries the movie...; \"The Host\" is dubbed rather clumsily which is somewhat overcome by the creative and original storyline. The night scenes are very dark and difficult to interpret, but the monster holds up wonderfully in broad daylight. Character development is good, something most monster movies neglect entirely. My main objection would be the film trying to do too much and not quite tying everything together. Make no mistake, this is no man in a suit, plodding monster movie. \"The Host\" does not follow the typical plot line of this type film. There are surprises, tender moments, great locations, and people you actually care about. One more thing. The monster is fast and vicious. - MERK Believable characters and moments that will make you jump out of your chair.....; I happened to watch this tonight at the cinema although I don't speak or understand Korean... let alone Japanese...however it wasn't difficult to grasp the story or get caught up with the characters and the situation. This film is comical in parts and borders on science fiction, drama and even horror, but it is really fantastic to watch and displays a lot of emotion and realistic reactions. The special effects are excellent, the characters are believable and it is one movie well worth watching even if it is in a different language. There is nothing like a creature from hell to add a bit of excitement to your day.... For the first time ever I knocked over my coke and jumped  feet out of my seat when I was suddenly and unexpectedly given the fright of my life....for those of you that like this kind of excitement....be on the watch out for this little gem. (Subtitles would be an idea). I highly recommend this film and cant wait to buy it and own it on DVD!!!! Wicked-Funny Movie with \"Laugh-tears\"; LISTEN UP, because this is something new: when the monster appears in full view at the very start, it means that THE MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT THE MONSTER-- I'm still trying to count how many clichés and stereotypes were introduced along with the monster. And the fact that it had the first \"original\" monster I've seen in years, with its own peculiar pattern of movements and behavior, was not what made me laugh, cry and shout, \"There, there it is!\" (a \"live theatre\" experience). But there are  things to be gotten out of the way for \"international audiences\"-- ) If you have no idea what East Asia went through during the various health scares just after the year , you may fault this movie for being \"over-the-top\"-- when in fact, its portrayal of human reaction is quite \"realistic\". ) If you can't deal with \"laugh-tears\" or the way Korean/ Eastern genre movies \"mix genres\" and disobey the \"catharsis\" principle requiring \"pure\" comedy, OR tragedy, etc.), then you will only be able to appreciate the parts of the movie \"belong\" to genre which you classify it into (\"comedy\", OR \"tragedy\", etc.). Entertaining, but you'll be confused if you try to follow the plot.; Seven Thoughts on The Host: First, I couldn't find anything to do with a \"host.\" Maybe, \"The Mutant.\" Something was definitely off in the translation. Second, do all Korean movies introduce random, yet very essential characters, at the end of the film? Third, I laughed out loud at the very, VERY dry-humored moments, but they contrast greatly with most of the scenes that follow. None of the quotes on the DVD package even hinted that it would be comedy. But if you don't treat it as one, you'll be very disappointed. Fourth, did the makers develop the plot during the process of the film shoot? Fifth, don't watch it dubbed. Switch it to subtitles and let them speak Korean. The movie improves dramatically. Sixth, I'd rent it once, but there's no way in hell I'd buy this. Seventh, The Host reminded me a lot of V for Vendetta--both have their dark moments that are brightened by extremely dry characters, all with a political undertone. Of course V for Vendetta was supposed to be a comic-book style movie... The Host is supposed to be a Thriller/Horror/Monster Movie/Comedy... I still don't know what category to put it under. And neither will you if you really think about it. The Host; The Host is by far one of the best monster movies in years. The movie follows a bumbling young father, Gang-Do Park, and his family. The story starts like every monster movie; everything is calm and uneventful, \"business as usual\" you might say. When a mutated fish creature comes along the river bank and begins killing anyone in its path. Amidst all of the confusion, Gang-Do's daughter, Hyun-seo, is picked up by the monster and dragged back to the sewer. The story then turns into a search for Hyun-seo. Gang-Do and his family evade the authorities and use all the money they have to desperately continue their quest. The reason I picked up this movie in the first place is because the box said that it was \"on par with Jaws.\" I found this hard to believe but the monster in The Host is the one of the most cinematically pleasing CG creations in recent years and is probably the most original looking monster since Alien. It was legitimately scary looking and had a very unique style of moving that set it apart from previous monsters. Another strength of this monster is how well the CG is done. It does not just look like some computer generated figure spliced into live action footage. It looks like it belongs in the shot. The monster also has enough on screen time to make the movie suspenseful. The movie keeps the viewer wanting to see more of the monster while, at the same time, keeping them satisfied with the number of appearances. The Park family does a pretty good job of keeping the audience entertained while the monster is off screen. The relationship that Gang-Do shares with his father, \"college man\" brother, and professional archer sister maintains a balance of drama and humor that the audience can appreciate. This dynamic seems strange but the movie makes it work. You start to really feel like these people are family. The best thing about these characters is that you are not disappointed when they are on the screen. Some monster movies seem to get kind of boring when the monster is off screen (Godzilla ). The weakest thing about this movie, as it is with most foreign films, is the English translation and dubbing. After a while it becomes bearable but in the beginning it sounds absolutely awful. I don't say this very often because, like many Americans, I hate reading subtitles. But I think this one time I would have made the exception because the voice acting was just terrible. They just didn't seem to fit the characters very well. The dialogue in some scenes is very awkward as well. Some of the English translation just sounds out of place. This happens a lot with language barriers, however, and sometimes it just cannot be helped. If you want to watch something that is not meant to be in your language, you've just got to go with what you get. I started off saying that this is one of the best monster movies in years, and it is. It's not perfect, but what monster movie is? It has some flaws but the originality of the monster and the simplicity of the plot makes this movie very easy to follow and worth watching at the very least. It is pretty good for what it is. The whole \"monster terrorizing an Asian town\" seems like it has been done a million times (because it has), but this movie has some new things to offer. Would I call this movie \"on par with Jaws\"? I wouldn't personally, but it is definitely better than some of the cheesy messes that monster movies have made in the past. Monster; Quarantined after coming in contact with an amphibious sea monster, a slow-witted man flees and searches for his daughter when nobody else believes she has survived the monster attack in this South Korean horror movie. Powered by incredible special effects, 'The Host' has some breathtaking moments as the creature leaps around the infrastructure of Seoul with acrobatic precision; scenes of it plowing mercilessly into crowds have quite an impact too. The bits without the monster are a lot less engaging though. Part of the issue is that the characters are hard to warm to. Kang-ho Song is the most likable with his dedication to his daughter, yet the film uncomfortably plays his social awkwardness and dimwitted nature for laughs. The other issue is that the film packs too much in thematically without exploring every issue. Subplots include thoughtless disposal of dangerous chemicals, government paranoia, a possible virus, and the conviction of government agents that the protagonist is slow-witted due to being infected by the monster. The film has received considerable praise over the years for raising so many ideas, but with none explored in particular depth, this is a film that only really comes alive when the monster is on screen. Fortunately though, it is a great-looking creature, and one that always seems more confused by its human surroundings than genuinely evil. Total Crap with good special effects; I don't know how this train wreck of a movie was able to garner any awards other than through bribery. If you can make it through the first five minutes of this lunacy  pouring chemicals down the drain because their bottles are dusty  then perhaps you'll understand what you're in for. Be prepared for a lot of bad acting, bad directing and a bad storyline (that is\n",
       "if you can pick one of the many they chose). In regards to the acting\n",
       "I'm speechless (as such, I'd be a better actor than some of these people). As far as directing: there's one scene that was shot out of focus\n",
       "I think that should give you an idea of the rest of the movie. Now storyline: Which one to complain about  The family feud, the old man with the shop (who can't act), the drunken uncle (who can't act), the loser son (who can't act) with daughter (best actress in the film), a scary monster, a pandemic, Americans trying to muscle in on the poor Koreans who don't want them there...they're all bad. It could have been good if only they chose to focus on one. This movie is just a disaster. The one saving grace are the special effects. Aside from that, don't listen to all the other people who gave this movie  stars  they've obviously been paid. Weird; It may be weird but it's sure as heck entertaining. From the Korean film industry you have a good idea. What would happen if a monster lived in the Han River ( a bit like The Loch Ness Monster) and thus the idea for this film was born. All the locations are real, even the sewer isn't a set. That's a real sewer! The actors are very good, we're following the fortunes and misfortunes of the Park family. Gramps the alcoholic, Dad who runs a food stand, brother is a failed college graduate, sister is a world class archer and and grand daughter in school. Basically this film is a kidnap film where the grand daughter is taken by the monster and dad and the others have to overcome many trials to save her life. The effects for the creature were all done in the US and it looks pretty darn good. The story holds up well, the plot is fairly decent and all the actors are excellent. Don't worry about it being subtitled, it's still very easy to watch and highly enjoyable. A pretty solid effort, but needed more Creature!; The directors \"Memories of murder\" was very good, yet went on a little too long as did \"The Host.\" Now I love a decent two hour plus movie, but it has to have something going on interesting during some of the duller parts of the scripts. I would not have cut not a lot but probably - minutes worth and it would have been a better flick. Whoever decided to go over to the Best special effects companies (Oscar winning Weta was one) to do their flick and pay a little more to get it done Right, was/is the biggest reason why the film looks so good. Seriously the best script in the world that has a giant creature as the main character, and used special effects that suck (Ahem Sci-Fi channel movie quality I mean) no one would have watched it or enjoyed it as much. Now I liked the film quite a bit, but not nearly as much as so many others. The first hour in particular, (except for a few heart-pounding sequences) was really slow getting going. I also felt that we never really got much of a grasp or a good understanding of all the main characters. While in \"Alien\" we get to know all of the main characters quite well, and care about what happens to them. The one character we did get to know pretty well was the girls father, and it was written well, and he grew the most of the main characters. I liked this and maybe in subsequent viewings I will catch more and enjoy it even more. Overall the acting was top-notch in most parts, but if anyone watches this not in the native language of Korean, you will be sorry. The Dubbing, (at least the English dubbing) is absolutely atrocious, embarrassing, and will ruin the film. I don't know who does the dubbing, but it is just terrible! (Of course just about all of them are) This is a fun monster movie, but the monster unfortunately In my opinion is barely used and seems like a waste to not involve the creature a little more in movie. This is no Alien, but it is a valiant effort and will go down as a pretty solid monster movie. Yeah...is this the right movie?; Believe me, I was excited to see this one. I'm always excited when I get a chance to see a new movie, especially if I've heard great things about it. But this wasn't just a great new flick, it was also supposed to be the \"best monster movie since Godzilla\". Apparently, the genre is pretty easily satisfied. Now I'm not going to say it was horrible, because it wasn't. There was some comedy I appreciated (mostly because I'm racist and I think that people from Asian countries have an unhealthy obsession with disease) and there were some valid jabs at the shortcomings of bureaucracy. There were some very well developed characters. But it was slow, and quite a few of the scenes were just tedious as hell. And they shouldn't have been. This could have been a great film, and I think everyone involved in production (including the CG artists) just came up short. If it's on late at night and you've got nothing else to watch- sure. But don't go out of your way for this one, you'll be pretty disappointed. Reflect the gloomy side of Korea; The movie seems to be just a monster movie. But i think it might reflect the gloomy side of Korea. So i want to talk about it. There's a family that operates a small snack bar on Han river. It looks like ordinary times. KangDu(who is the main character and Hyunseo's father)is sleeping. But suddenly, something appears in the river. It was taking pictures of people. and it was stretching its body. It is a monster which has made toxic chemicals from the U.S. army. It kills people and eats them. Everyone is in a panic. Then, they are running away from the Han river. KangDu is running away with Hyunseo,too. But he missed her hand. She was eaten by the monster. After the monster hid away, there was a joint funeral. Every member of KangDu's family came for HyunSeo. There are HeeBong, who is KangDu's father, NamIl and NamJu who are KangDu's younger broter and sister. They sob in front of Hyunseo's picture. And the journalists keep taking pictures of them for their benefit. The government authorities can't explain this situation. The bereaved family don't know why those who were loved had died, and don't know why they had to die. The government kept them away from the answer. They just told them \"We can't explain. Because we don't have much time. So watch TV.\" But there's no TV which report accurate information. So they press the government. Then the government gets into a corner and isolates them. At the same time, the news announces the Virus only and the other nations believe that only. And then, the TV shows a U.S. soldier as a 'Hero' who was \"made\" the monster. KangDu called his daughter. So told the government about this. But they ignored him and they even threatened him. At the pressing situation, we are barbarians to them. The only way of survival is with her family. They take decisive action escape the isolation. A company which help them to escape aimed at the money. They paid everything, and they were broke. At that time, the news announced KangDu's family escaped everywhere. On the TV news, they were treated like dreadful criminals. That means the Assailant becomes the Hero, and the Victims become the Assailants. The government and the press chased the family, not a monster. They went to the Han river to save Hyunseo. In that situation, the private enterprise paid the government workers. The government workers aim at the money, not the rescue. Now, the family is fighting with an invisible enemy. When the government protections crumbled, other victims appeared. The nation let the people alone. When they(the family) have a late dinner, they imagine being with her. They miss the ordinary times. Finally, they meet the monster. They are fighters with guns who were normal people before. The soldiers get near them because of the gun shot. But in the end, Heebong passed away because of the monster. At that moment, they run away from the nation and the world feels pity for the U.S. soldier's death, not their father's. The family members who chased the monster fall down one by one. Actually, there was no virus. The government wasted time, during that period so many people were dying. HyunSeo is tired, so she decides to escape herself. But eventually she was swallowed by the monster. When the family found her, she already died. After all, the monster died. But the last time, only the family fought the monster. The time passes. Now, KangDu can't sleep and he always feels nervous. The TV still shows stupid news, and the news is of no value. P.S.) In the Prologue, a man takes his own life in the Han river. The desperate man can see something inside the river. But the other guys can't see that. It may mean you can't see if you aren't interested. A rousing success and a ton of fun; An irresponsible U.S. Army doctor has his Korean aid dump a large quantity of toxic chemicals into the sink. The chemicals drain straight into the Han River with an unexpected and disastrous result. The chemicals are responsible for the creation of a giant mutant monster with a taste for human flesh. The creature goes on a rampage and takes a girl named Hyun-seo into the river. She is presumed dead until her father receives a garbled call from Hyun-seo's cell phone. Is she really alive? Hyun-seo's family takes to the sewers in search of her. I've been a fan of Creature Features for as long as I can remember. I grew up on stuff like Godzilla, Rodan, and the other multitude of giant creatures attacking every major city on the planet. With The Host, we have a new giant creature for a new millennium. And for the most part, it's a rousing success and a ton of fun. The opening scenes are some of the best and most believable (if any of this stuff can really be called believable) giant creature on a rampage that I've ever seen. The creature design is great. It's just what I would picture from a something horribly mutated by toxic chemicals. And I can't think of many movies where CGI was used better or more appropriately. It's really quite phenomenal. Equally amazing is the mix of humor and horror present in The Host. Some scenes are creepy while others had me all but laughing out loud. And then there's the ending. I'm not going to give it away, so I'll just say that it's much more touching than I could have imagined. It all but brought a tear to my eye. Overall, The Host features quite an intelligent, well-written script and is surely one of the better movies of this type I've seen in a long time. As much as I enjoyed The Host, it's far from perfect. To begin with, I tend to agree with some of those who found the second act disappointing. It's not that the middle portion of the movie is bad or anything, it's just not the thrill-a-minute of the opening scenes. My other problem relates to the film's anti-American stance. While I would agree that the filmmakers have every right to express whatever political opinion they may have, it's a bit overdone and too obvious in my opinion. Best Creature Film In Years...; \"The Host\" is just another reason why Koreans are quickly emerging as the most creative, personal, and daring filmmakers working today. Circumventing around the illegal dumping of toxic chemicals, a busy Korean river becomes home to a large carnivorous sea-creature. It's bipedal ability gives it access to the bustling river shore where hundreds of citizens flock each day, and where a particular \"down on their luck\" family runs a convenience stand. After a terrific opening action sequence with the said monster attacking, and scores upon scores of people running for their lives, the beast leaps away into the water with a small girl in grasp. The girl, the daughter of one of the aforementioned stand owners is thought dead until certain plot changes arise, and the characters set off for the child. Of course though, there are other plot transitions that add depth to each character, as well blockades to their progress, but this film is really at its best when the creature is on screen and the action is in full throttle. The acting is great with touches of comedy here and there, and the direction, music, and cinematography all add to the experience. There's even room for a few morality lessons if one is privy to listen. Though \"The Host\" isn't exactly a horror film, it does have thrills and adventure similar to \"Jurassic Park,\" and mixes realism with fantasy very convincingly. All in all, it's a very cool film that puts Hollywood horror flicks to shame. Very disappointed I spent £ renting this; I have no idea why other people have given raving reviews about this film. In my opinion this film started off really well getting straight to the action in a few minutes from the start. After the first half hour though everything seems to slow down like you're wading through a thick bog. The only decent bits after that were when the monster reappeared and I actually got so fed up that I ended up using the fast forward button through most of the story. The \"dad\" of the young girl annoyed me so much that I desperately wanted him to be eaten or killed or whatever. Any person who tries to explain his daughter being taken by a monster by miming the scene using a phone, his mouth and a bin should be shot. Sadly this wasn't the case. Good CGI but the film could've been cut down by at least mins from its near  hour length. Iconic and brilliant!; When there are tourists and travelers walking up and down the banks of the Han river in Seoul asking where the best place to see the 'Monster from the Han river' is, you know there is something big behind it all. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux_bStefZAo And that is 'The Host'. As exciting as it is iconic, this urban creature feature became the highest grossing Korean film in the history of the country, it's moody locations and grim tone (how many films dare turn a memorial service into a comedy?) creating an atmosphere around the monster that lasts even after it is revealed in all its slippery glory in a fantastic daylight attack near the start of the film. For a film about a foul-smelling fish monster to feel as fresh as it does, especially after the American Godzilla seemingly destroyed the genre over a decade ago, is quite an achievement. Bring on 'The Host II', and keep those tourists patrolling the Korean waterways for signs of the beast! Seen this one before...; I saw it the first time when it was called \"The Relic\". Same looking monster, just a worse story line. And unfortunately, the monster is the only good thing about this movie. Obviously the acting isn't going to be good (especially since it was dubbed), but I wasn't looking for good acting in a \"monster movie\". The movie is a little less than two hours, and there is maybe only  minutes total that was entertaining. I give the special effects team credit though. They took a monster from a previous movie that had hair, and turned it into a monster with scales instead. Bravo...fantastic imagination! If you liked The Relic, you will be very disappointed in The Host. Best monster movie in a long time..; * may contain spoilers * This movie was an unpredictable, light, frightening, and humorous rescue/horror. The characters each have distinct issues, and there exists a tension but togetherness in the family that is all too realistic. The plot line is disjoint, but is superbly executed -- the story weaves around character to character and subplot to subplot getting increasingly disjoint until the final scenes. The monster in the movie is excellently portrayed, and at no stage did I empathise, anthropomorphise, or predict the actions or intentions of it. I felt a great sense of desperation and surprise watching this movie, and highly recommend it to everyone. The best Monster Movie of the last decade; The Host is a  Korean film, directed by Bong Joon-Ho. The film starts out as the classic Monster StoryTelling, alas an error committed by human injures nature, and because of this, a terror under the shape of a murderous creature appears, to seek revenge. The monster is indeed well introduced, with a first mysterious appearance of a young creature, that is never actually shown on screen because of the shots, and then with a man committing suicide because he has seen \"something dark\" in the water. He's probably the same man who assisted the Doctor that ordered to dump Formaldehyde. What does indeed render The Host unique in its genre, is how this concept is later developed. The Monster itself in the end is somewhat a secondary part of the story, because in this film, the storyline is focused mainly on the human protagonists; a family that has just lost one beloved member, young Hyun-Seo (played with great skill by Ko Ah-Seong, who has been complimented even by the director himself), kidnapped and dragged into the Han River by the Monster. She is believed to be dead until a mysterious phone call is received by the half-retarded (not kidding) Protagonist Gang-Du. The family then starts seeking for the young girl, but is blocked because the creature seems to bring a deadly virus (that in reality doesn't exist, and is only a device used by the US Government), and hence they have been in the area devastated by it (Gang-Du has even attacked it resulting in some blood sprayed on his face), they are put under quarantine. They however manage to escape thanks to mercenaries hired by Hee-Bong. At this point their desperate research for Hyun-Seo begins. It turns out she is trapped in the sewers of the city, in a location that could be called the \"storeroom\" of the Monster since it lays here the captured preys only to consume them later. The scenes in which this location is featured are not much gory as one would imagine - but are indeed somewhat disturbing, especially when Gwoemul begins to vomit (literally) the bare bones of its past victims, creating what could be described as a \"Death Fountain\", and is indeed the major disturbing factor of the film. In the end the creature is killed by Gang-Du, but not before he has to acknowledge the death of his daughter, that sacrificed herself to save a kid, Se-Jo. The Monster, called Gwoemul during production (this would later become the original title of the film), is a gigantic mutant catfish, estimated to be the size of a whole truck, that has a complex Mouth Apparate, similar for those who have seen the films, to the Carnivore Plant in Jumanji, or, more strikingly, the Sandworms from Dune or the Graboids from Tremors. It has three-four claws on each toe of its main limbs, which are used for locomotion, and a row of Fins on the back. The most striking detail is the asymmetry given by what seems to be a developed bladder on the monster's left eye. A very good design indeed, that is portrayed on screen almost perfectly through CGI, created by the Orphanage, and Practical Animatronics effects, built by the well-known Weta Workshop, which also worked on the Lord of the Ring Trilogy and King Kong (). The Korean Cast does a great dramatic (if sarcastic) performance and definitely triumphs over the lifeless cast of Dragon Wars (another Korean films which doesn't use national actors as the main characters), the Big-Budgeted Korean Monster Film that came just one year later. The Host is one of those rare Monster Films that almost reach perfection, and is definitely suggested for those who search a monster crossed with a good dramatic plot, a rare event nowadays. An overall solid film; The Plot The Host, directed by Joon-ho Bong is a Korean horror (Monster) film. There are American subtitles through the entire move. It is about a creature that's mutated due to chemicals running into a public river. Done in the classic sci-fi manner of 'doctor/scientist make stupid goof up, and unleash chaos into the world', the resulting monster focuses on attacking and eating it's captives. Gang Du, played by Kang-Ho, is the titular hero of the movie, providing a very down to earth take on the protagonist role. Gang-du helps run a family owned squid and beer stand beach side with his father and daughter. When the creature makes its appearance, wreaking havoc on the beach, the family tries its best in order to rescue Gang Du's daughter. The film is good at keeping the watcher interested. It has comedic relief and is filled with drama, keeping the watcher at the edge of their seats. The story focuses more so on the relationship among the main characters, and their ambition for rescuing Gang Du's daughter. Cinematography The Cinematography is well done. It is easy to see all of the action and they keep the screen very well lit. The monster doesn't look fake and it put into the movie very well. The actors never seem blurry and show up very well. There is also little camera shaking. Watch the first scene of the movie on mute. The dialogue between the two characters feels unnatural. Rely on the images to get the story, and the images in this low key dark comedy monster flick are AMAZING! Everything in this movie supports the story to a 'T' in the imaging department. You can see the progression of the lighting from the introduction of the main character Gang-Doo, which is low contrast even inside the sack which we see later; he very contrasts even in shadows. The lighting compliments the mood of the scene, what we should feel. At the river, things are very bright and seem safe. You barely realize there is a monster running to terrorize the unsuspecting person until it's there and suddenly stuff gets real. There is a shift in lighting ratio, representing the danger by adding contrast. I always wondered why the first scene we see the monster in seems less threatening and very dangerous at the same time. The answer to this, from what I see is that it's lit for comedy. There are moments where at a very serious moment something funny happens. For example Gang-Doo grabs the wrong girl. Although it's funny, it's played serious. There moments in the movie are what make this a great movie. Acting I always find it difficult to really critic acting when they are speaking another language, Korean. First off when watching the movie you are only given a close translation of what they are saying. You don't get to have the exact wording that the actor is using. Another aspect is you must focus on the words at the bottom of the screen, which can also distract you from watching the actors. However, Kang-ho Song did do a very good job. He expressed a lot of emotion and that is very important when I don't know what he is saying. It really helps the watcher understand what is going on. The actors were also good at working with the fake monster to create the allusion that it was really attacking and eating people. There is also an English dubbed version of the film; still the exact translation is not as accurate. Sound From the beginning to the end the sound editing of the entire film was perfectly balanced and well blended. The music, the sound effects and the vocals are clearly heard. The crescendos and decrescendos really add to the suspense in the movie. At the end of the movie the flow of the music lets you know you are at the end of the movie. It really adds to the movie. Written by Mathew Case and David Veerkamp and Edited by Malcolm Ray Artistically rendered monster movie with a message; Joon-ho Bong is exactly the kind of director we need more of. Here's a director with a keen, distinctive visual style who cares about plot and characters. Most directors who display a similar mastery of the medium make slow paced, heavy films that are more about how things happen and the attitudes of the people that experience them than what actually happens. While these films often present a welcome alternative to brain dead action films it seems that there are too few films which try to find a middle ground between those two extremes. Bong has found that middle ground and the result represents the best of both worlds. With his  film Memories of Murder Bong reinvigorated the police procedural and breathed new life into one of the most hackneyed of genres. In  he turned his attention to the monster movie and The Host became the biggest box office hit of all time in his native South Korea. Unlike many blockbusters, The Host is a film which deserves its success. Although Bong shows his creature frequently and in detail he always manages to keep the focus on the human characters. The main character of the film is a slacker doofus who is unlucky enough to be in the path of the rampaging creature the first time it emerges from the sea and this event ends up shaping his destiny as he fights back against the creature and gets its viral blood on him and a few minutes later it attacks his daughter. Along with his sister, brother, and father he is then drawn into the government's rather ineffectual efforts to quarantine everyone who has had contact with the creature as they are sure it's the host of some terrible new disease. Like Godzilla before it The Host creature exists at least in part due to mankind's influence on the environment. Just as the former creature was enhanced by nuclear radiation the latter has his origins in river pollution. The Host is more obviously critical of mankind's carelessness, however, as we are shown a gutless Korean scientist agreeing to pour dangerous chemicals into a drain in order to please his American boss. This act of pollution is based on a real life incident which shows that the problems faced by developing countries like South Korea are often caused by both domestic and international elements. The continued meddling of foreign powers and the mindblowing incompetence of South Korean government agencies puts the individuals caught in the middle into an increasingly dire situation. The Host isn't quite as well made as Memories of Murder but like that film it takes an approach that makes it feel fresh even if it is undoubtedly a genre work. It also has a bit more of a \"B Movie\" tone albeit not nearly as much as one might expect based on the trailer and other publicity. If these two films are any indication Bong should be a major talent for many years to come. the longest one hundred fourteen minutes and fifty four seconds of my life; i really wanted to like this film.but it just wasn't mean to work out.not only was it all over the place in terms of tone.comedy/action/drama/adventure.some of which i'm not sure were intentional.the comedy for instance.there are also couple of scenes that don't seem to belong and are not explained,which really annoyed me.but the biggest obstacle to engaging this movie was that it just went on and on and on.i almost couldn't take it.i watched it to the end.but it was a chore.that was what killed the whole experience for me,was just how slow it was.it it hadn't been for that,i might have enjoyed the movie.the actual creature itself was not that bad looking.i have seen worse,and better.i did like the look of the film.it had a certain style to it.and the ending was touching.i started to watch the film in dubbed English but found the dubbing quality not so good,so quickly switched to Korean with English Subtitles,which i would recommend.i can't really recommend this film based on how long it seemed to take to get through,but if you do choose to watch,just know that you may need a great deal of patience A disappointment; Gwoemul (The Host) - Due to pollution in the Han river a mutated beast goes on the rampage. The youngest member of the Park family is snatched by the beast, and it is up to the rest of her family to find her, before she becomes the beast's latest meal. Firstly, I love monster movies: Mutated bears, over-sized alligators, packs of ravening Komodo dragons, the whole lot. Creature features are my favourite kind of Horror film. So, I really wanted to like The Host, but it wasn't to be. There were three major problems with it: The first can be seen with a quick look at it's IMDb page Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller Too many damned genres. It took itself too seriously to be a comedy, and yet was too light hearted to have any real message (though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement. Anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government). The drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mish-mash with all the other styles. Secondly, after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film. The central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of Korea and America, apparently, do nothing. And that's it, they just wander about, occasionally hitting one another, presumably for a bit of comedy relief. This lack of action made my attention wander, and apparently it did the same for the director, as whole plot threads go unresolved (a mystery plague invented by the evil Americans is completely forgotten about, and is never resolved). And lastly, the film is clumsily political. It paints the Americans as being stupid and evil, but gives us no American characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain. The opening scene has the most obvious stupid American vs wise Korean moment. With a Korean morgue assistant asking his boss, the coroner, not to pour chemicals into the Han river. The American coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on. As well as being racist, it's lazy film-making and there is no excuse for that. On the plus side, the monster is good, kind of a mix of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the movement effects are quite cool, and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun. There are also some nice shots in the film. Some of which remind me, strangely, of the way Firefly was filmed (shuddering cameras, out of focus shots etc).There is also a nice scene at the end, where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the family's mobile food stall. It's night-time and snow is falling, the street-lamp is giving out a cold light, but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it. Overall, I was really disappointed by this film. I'd been looking forward to a decent creature flick, and instead I get some pseudo-political,horror-comedy lite. Looking at the comments on IMDb I can't help but think that if this had been a US production it would have been slated. Just 'cause it's a foreign flick doesn't mean it's any good. There have been some great movies out of Korea in recent years (The vengeance trilogy and Brotherhood, for example), but this certainly isn't one of them. For once I'm in favour of a remake. Tighten up the directing, improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film. As it is, it's not worth a couple of hours of anyone's time. Kept me in my seat; No matter how much I am into a movie, I always have to go to the john at some point. This is the first movie in ages that I didn't have to. Whether that makes it good or not, I don't know, but at least you get an idea of how engrossing it was. I never go see monster flicks, and went to this one just because it's Korean, as I like Korean movies. Having read all the positive comments, I have to agree with a lot of them, and I learned something about monster movies in the process. However, I could never get into the \"comedy\" elements of the movie. I knew, OK, this is supposed to be funny, but in the context of the movie, I couldn't even break a smile. It's not the kind of movie where fart jokes work. People have commented about the \"ordinary\" family in this movie, but they are not an ordinary one, but an extremely dysfunctional one (at least in society's eyes) -- a la \"Independence Day\" -- which is what makes it interesting. Like most monster movies there are plot holes everywhere, which you're not supposed to think about; and the villain -- the US military and their Korean buddies -- is way too broad and obvious (not to mention that the actors are awful). A tiny detail, but I like how at the beginning of the movie in the riverside park there are not just Koreans, but foreigners mingling in (and not just blue-eyed blonde ones). It adds a touch of the everyday \"reality\" that is supposed to be the backdrop of the movie. Fun creature feature; A fun little creature feature that examines familial relationships and media manipulation along the way, THE HOST tells the tale of the Park family, a group of misfits whose patriarch runs a food stand on the banks of Seoul's Han River. His eldest son, Kang-du (Kang-ho Song), is a little slow and spends most of his time sleeping when he's not hanging out with his daughter, Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko), watching his sister blow the national archery championships. Meanwhile, Kang-du's brother is a layabout lout who can't get over his days as a young revolutionary. Things come to a crisis for the Parks when a creature rises from the depths of the Han, causing death, destruction, and dismay as it drags Hyun-seo back into the brine with it. Mudskipper Looking like a giant mudskipper, the creature makes its appearance early and not in any kind of spooky \"hidden in the shadows\" way. When it comes on the scene, everyone knows it. Luckily, the effects (at least on the small screen) are top notch which really adds to the excitement. After the attack, everyone present (and still breathing) is taken to a government-run shelter. An American present at the attack is diagnosed with a virus and the word is spread that the creature is its host (thus the title). The only other person exposed as much to the dreaded fish is Kang-du. Already distraught enough about the loss of his daughter, he's soon taken aside for some surely painful tests. Little does he know that Hyun-seo is still alive; a prisoner of the creature in its sewer lair. When she places a brief call to Kang-du he tries to get his captors to believe him. Alas, no one in authority in THE HOST gives any credence to anyone other than other authority figures. Kang-du and the rest of the Parks easily escape the lame excuse for a quarantine center and begin their futile search for Hyun-seo through the sewers of Seoul. I won't go on any more lest I give something away. Suffice to say that this is another fine play on a genre film by Joon-ho Bong. The last work I saw from him was MEMORIES OF MURDER (see Cashiers du Cinemart #), a fine play on the serial killer film. This time out he presents a rather fully-realized work that could have simply been a fish tale. Recommended.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Long forgotten Kazan Gem Has Contempory Message.; I had forgotten this movie until I saw it again on the the satellite. You can feel, see and smell the New Orleans of , thanks to Kazan, his cast and script. A few months ago, the fear and problem of a biological bomb would seem fictional. Today, not so. This movie is almost a precursor of today. We have dedicated men in law enforcement and the medical community trying to catch the carriers of the disease. They have to bend a few rules to catch them. The bad guys Jack Palance and Zero Mostel play off each other perfectly. The one domineering and evil, the other passive and pathetic. I like the movie because Richard Widmark and the police Captain played by Paul Douglas are portrayed as guys just getting by financially, but the most important guys in town while the bugs are loose. Great Movie. Minor Work from a Cinema Great; \"Panic in the Streets\" is a pretty standard B-movie that is raised a notch above other standard B-movies by its direction. Elia Kazan could take just about any material and make it better than it would otherwise have been in the hands of many others, and this film is no exception. It's a high-concept film: a murdered man's body ends up at the New Orleans city morgue and an autopsy reveals that it was infected with bubonic plague. The race is on to find the man's murderer to stop an epidemic. You would think this would get fairly run-of-the-mill treatment, which it sort of does, but it's Kazan's version of run-of-the-mill, which means there are all sorts of little directorial touches that prevent the film's style from feeling anonymous. Kazan had a knack for atmosphere, and the New Orleans setting really comes alive, as it would a year later for his masterpiece \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" Richard Widmark is the doctor from the health bureau whom no one will believe, and he gives a fine, tense performance. Jack Palance uses his unbelievably sharp cheekbones and jawline to good effect as Blackie, the murderer on the lam. Zero Mostel is assigned the thankless duty of playing Blackie's sap of a fall guy. And I really liked Paul Douglas in a droll performance as the New Orleans chief of police and Widmark's right-hand-man. The premise of this movie has become eerily relevant in today's climate, which actually makes it somewhat uncomfortable to watch. But it's actually got a surprising amount of humor in it too. Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays his wife, have a lot of witty banter that sounds like the way married people really talk. Credit once again goes to Kazan for creating a female character that feels like a full-bodied person and not simply a collection of \"feminine\" traits. Widmark and Douglas are funny together too, and there's a laugh-out-loud scene when Douglas is interrogating some Asian boat workers who have only the barest grasp of the English language. The obligatory chase and fight scene at the end does not feel at all staged, which is refreshing. The fist fight looks clunky and clumsy, which is how fist fights in real life are, not the nicely choreographed things we are used to seeing in Hollywood movies. The whole movie has a refreshing realism to it, so while it may not be especially profound or one that you remember for years, it will probably entertain you for a couple of hours at least and may strike you as a cut above other movies of its type. Grade: B+ Thugs get more than they bargain for; Good drama depicting how the government must cover up a killer disease which threatens a city. The carriers are a trio of hoods, each fearful or mistrustful of the other and unknowing of their plight. In a race against time and unbelieving city fathers, a medical official must try to control the dreaded plague. A great chase scene at the end creates a spine tingling finale. Low rent, but a great story; PANIC IN THE STREETS is the sort of film that could do with a modern-day remake, because the story is so fantastic and would work in any period. It tells of a dedicated detective who's hot on the trail of a criminal gang who, unbeknownst to themselves, are infected with the deadly bubonic plague virus. The detective must juggle the media - he doesn't want the story to come out due to the panic it'll cause - alongside his frightened wife and pursuit of the gang if he wants to prevent an epidemic. The only thing that works against this film is the obviously low budget, which means it lacks the finesse of, say, a Fritz Lang thriller from the period. It still does the job and ably so, with few slow spots and plenty of interest in the narrative. Richard Widmark proves a workable hero here, but he's outshone by the actors playing the criminal gang. The likes of Zero Mostel are good, but it's Jack Palance (in his debut role) who REALLY shines as the hostile gang leader. Palance is frightening, really frightening, one of those true movie psychos. PANIC IN THE STREETS incorporates plenty of suspense and even a little action into its storyline, particularly as we head towards the climax and the stakes are raised. There's a great, blackly comic set-piece involving the movement of a bedridden guy down a fire escape, plus an all-out chase at the climax which works really well. All in all this is a film noir that's well worth tracking down. They all talk like New Yorkers!; By sheer coincidence, I ended up watching a DVD of this celebrated film a few days into the tragic New Orleans flood. I expected to see a bit of local color, at the very least, and expected, too, some edge-of-the-seat suspense. (And I usually admire Elia Kazan's direction, esp. in his beautiful and moving film about the Tennessee Valley Authority, \"Wild River\" -- my favorite American love story.) I'm sorry to say that \"Panic\" struck me as hokey and dated. The various obtuse, stupid, and/or low-life characters who refuse to believe in the danger of a plague, or who for various reasons conceal it, are simply annoying; they seem like the standard Hollywood plot contrivances, designed to make us tear out our hair in frustration. The late Barbara Bel Gedes, as Richard Widmark's wife, is bland and tiresome (blame the role, not her); his little boy is as irritatingly Cute and Spunky as kids generally tend to be in movies of that day. And all the characters, including what are supposed to be native working-class Joes born in Louisiana, speak in standard film-noir New Yorkese! (Zero Mostel, disconcertingly, plays most of his scenes exactly the way he does in \"A Funny Thing Happened on the way to the Forum,\" with that same hangdog look and hands-extended/wrists-limp posture.) Sure, there's some obligatory jazz, but the film was quite a disappointment. For what it's worth, here are two personal favorites among New Orleans-based films: \"Angel Heart\" and the remake of \"Cat People.\" Great chase climaxes a `lost gem'; Refreshing `lost' gem!  Featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them.  The Douglas and Widmark characters are realistic heroes. Palance is his usual evil presence.  Widmark win the fisticuffs fight scene, a car chase of less than  seconds with a `logical' end, and a lengthy chase on foot that shames the overdone chase sequences of contemporary Hollywood.  You know how it will likely end, but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout.   The end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see.  The film seems to slow a little past the middle, but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion. Panic in the streets?  Not quite, but still a well produced and directed thriller.; This film should have been called something like Panic on the Beat or similar, because there never was any panic in the streets  it was all in the minds and action of the New Orleans city administration. Like all good films that go out of their way to promote the infallibility of authority, the good people of New Orleans were kept in the dark as various people  plagued by the plague -- wandered through the beautifully photographed dives and honky-tonks of downbeat New Orleans. This was a great movie, and I love it. With an imaginative story (one of the first  if not the first  to explore on film, in America, the effects of biological terror), a great cast and a production team headed by two of the all-time best: Elia Kazan as director (of On the Waterfront fame), and Sol C. Siegel as producer (famous for High Society, Some Came Running etc), this is a movie to watch without interruption. It won the  Oscar for Best Writing, so keep your concentration to catch some great lines between Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas  and, of course, the inimitable Zero Mostel fawning upon and wheedling with Jack Palance. The action starts rapidly, as a poker game is disrupted by a very sick player who runs off with his winnings  in fact, most of the pot. He has pneumonic plague (not bubonic, as it states in the Plot Outline) and doesn't know it. The other players, headed by Blackie (Jack Palance) supported by Raymond (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Tommy Cook) give chase and kill him, take the money, dump the body and run. So, they're all infected and don't know it  and every person they breathe on thereafter... So, when Commander Clint Reed (Richard Widmark) is called in, and he realizes the full import of the danger, the hunt is on. But, of course, he and the Police Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) don't know who they're looking for: the dead man has already been cremated on Reed's orders  too much risk of spreading the disease -- and there are no clues as to where he came from, his identity, how he got there, where he was going etc... What to do? The mayor makes the decision not to release the story to the press  too much risk of panic, and the killers will simply leave the city  so it's up to Reed and Warren to work together over the next  hours before it becomes necessary to spill the beans to the public. So, they're almost in a panic to find the carriers before that deadline. Three times, Reed just misses meeting up with Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Kazan tantalizes the viewer with both men in the same frame but unaware of the connection between them. Delicious filming that keeps you on the edge of your seat... Barbara Bel Geddes (as Reed's wife, Nancy) is almost wasted in this movie: her role is minimal at best and serves only to reinforce basic American family values. But, of course, this was the time (-) when those values were perceived to be very much under threat from the USSR and underground communism in the USA. Now, is it probable that the disease of this film is but a metaphor for the disease of communism? You can be the judge, but it matters not to me. I just turn down the lights and take in the action. So should you. \"Panic\", a modest upset at best -  with some misguided melodrama thrown in.; Elia Kazan's \"Panic In The Streets\" () is a serviceable thriller that starts off with a strong and evocative film noir style, but then degenerates into a rank detective thriller with a shotgun finish. It stars Richard Widmark as Lt. Commander Dr. Clinton Reed, a casual sort of family man who finds himself in the middle of a potential biological epidemic when an infected body washes on shore. The couple of bullet holes that in fact killed the man lead Reed to deduce that, at the very least, the murderers themselves are infected with the deadly virus. Meanwhile, back in a seedy forgotten quarter of the city, the two men responsible for the murder, Blackie (Jack Palance) and his goony henchman, Raymond Finch (Zero Mostel) are plotting their escape over the Mexican border. Blackie is the last to lose his cool, but eventually he does in atypical vintage Hollywood \"crime must pay\" style  leaving the viewer with no doubt that \"Panic In The Streets\" is just a metaphor for an impending disaster that never comes. Under the original title of \"Outbreak\" screenwriters, Edna and Edward Anhalt and Daniel Fuchs deliver a string of 'maguffins' that become tiresome before the final reel is through. There's the potential for city wide plague that never infects any more than four people; the alarmist way that Lt. Dr. Reed delivers his grave address to a suspecting city council, which disappears into quiet compliance after some initial and quickly forgotten angst; and finally; the heterosexual All-American goodie-two-shoes couple of Widmark and Barbara BelGeddes (Nancy Reed)  inexplicably inserted into the program and breaking the tense frenetic pace of the film with quiet moments involving their son. Upon its initial release, \"Panic In The Streets\" was not well received by either audiences or critics. That is has at last found a place among cinema-philes is fitting, for the film does have its artistic merits. But it does not represent either the best or even the very good of \"film noir\" as Fox's foray into developing a collection of such titles suggests. Fox's DVD presents a reasonably good looking transfer. The black and white picture elements are, on the whole, clean. Whites are generally very bright and blacks are deep and solid. Occasionally there is an excess of film dirt, grain and scratches, but these do not terribly distract. A minor amount of edge enhancement is also noticeable. The audio is mono and adequately presented. There are moments when it does sound a tad strident but this is to be expected for a film of this vintage with minimal restoration done. Extras are an audio commentary that will put one to sleep and a theatrical trailer. \"If there's a plague here, you're the most important guy in this town\"; 'Panic in the Streets ()' owes more to British noir that its American counterparts. Like Reed's 'The Third Man ()' and Dassin's 'Night and the City (),' director Elia Kazan chose to film largely on location, capturing the fresh and vibrant decadence of the New Orleans slums. In a decision borrowed from the masters of Italian neorealism, he also hired many non-professional actors for minor roles, lending an air of authenticity to the cityscape. However, any further comparisons with neorealism would be misguided, for 'Panic in the Streets' is pure melodrama, of the best kind. A murdered illegal immigrant, fished out of the bay, is found to be infected with pneumonic plague, a deadly air-borne mutation of bubonic plague, which is transmitted from human-to-human and, untreated, has a mortality rate that approaches %. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark), an officer with the U.S. Public Health Service, convinces the doubtful police-chief (Paul Douglas) to undertake a city-wide manhunt for the men responsible for the homicide, lest they also be infected with the illness. In my younger years, I found Wolfgang Petersen's 'Outbreak ()' to be among the most horrifying movies I'd ever seen. That thriller, which owes plenty to 'Panic in the Streets' {working title: \"Outbreak\"}, terrified me so efficiently because it depicted the ebola virus as both an invisible and invincible killer  how does one defend themselves against such a thing? Kazan's film is the first (that I know of) to approach the subject of biological epidemics, though it has difficulty ascribing visual recognition to an enemy that is basically undetectable to the human eye; it instead uses Jack Palance as a human personification of the Plague. Despite his venturing out among the filthy dregs of human society, you never get the sense that Clinton Reed is placing his own life at risk {some viewers have noted that Reed never inoculated himself against the plague, though I think it's safe to assume that he did so at the same time as the morgue staff}. Nevertheless, there's still a strong sense of urgency in the hunt for the infected man's killers, underground street-rats who pollute the sewers with their misdeeds. In medieval times, when the Black Death (now widely believed to have been bubonic plague) swept across the civilised world, killing a third of Europe's population, many identified the destruction as being the work of the Devil. Jack Palance's character, Blackie, serves effectively as Satan in human form: the angular-jawed thug can occasionally be charming and charismatic, but is always liable to explode into fits of violence; his two hoodlums (played by Guy Thomajan and Zero Mostel), through terror more than anything else, are constantly grovelling at his feet. When one lackey falls ill with fever, Blackie deduces that the man's immigrant cousin must have \"brought something in with him\" (the irony of his conclusion not passing unnoticed), and so attempts to ascertain what this presumably valuable object must be. He cradles the dying Poldi in his arms, a grotesque display of faux affection that is both pathetic and unsettling. Blackie/Satan is finally stopped  not by the authorities, but by the burden of his own infection/evil  as he attempts to board a cargo ship, the primary vessel by which the Plague spread across Europe. excellent drama; When plague breaks out in New Orleans, it's Richard Widmark to the rescue in \"Panic in the Streets,\" one of the lesser-celebrated films of the great Elia Kazan. Kazan keeps the pace brisk, and there are lots of marvelous touches - the scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays his wife and the scene in the police station show family life and work life and the relationships of average citizens, which is in sharp contrast to the lives and relationships of the low-lifes, portrayed by a menacing Jack Palance, his weak yes man, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook, and Louis Charles. There are also some interesting visuals - Palance has a couple of scenes with actors who seem to come up to his knees in height. The acting is marvelous and the dialogue sharp if the story isn't quite up to the direction and performances. It has a few questionable aspects which will be spotted by the viewer quite easily. That aside, it's well worth viewing. Kazan was a masterful director. Offbeat Noir; Plague replaces femme fatale in this highly suspenseful noir shot in New Orleans by director Elia Kazan. Kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes. A man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game. It turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact. City and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease. A detective and an epidemiologist up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they comb the waterfront employing their contrasting investigatory styles. Streets raises a huge ethical question about the publics right to know as the medical officer argues for a media blackout thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community. Regardless of outcome, you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the film's protagonist. Richard Widmark as Dr.Clint Reed and Paul Douglas as Detective Warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers. Barbera Bel Geddis as Reed's wife has some good moments with Widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of (restful more than comic) relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim environs of the New Orleans waterfront impressively lensed by cinematographer Joe McDonald. Zero Mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic. Walter Jack Palance as the skeletal Blackie (Black Death?) is simply outstanding. With riveting intensity Palance dominates every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well. In addition he displays a formidable athleticism that allows for a more suspenseful continuity, especially in the film's powerful final allegorical moments. Panic in the Streets is probably Kazan's best non-Brando film. It's tension filled, suspensefully well paced and edited. It's ambient on locale setting lends a sense of heightened reality that allows Kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with Panic he succeeds with aplomb. Stylish thriller by Kazan; \"Panic in the Streets\" stars Jack Palance as a violent criminal infected with a deadly airborne virus. As Jack travels throughout the New Orleans underworld, this virus spreads, infecting all whom he comes into contact with. On the case are Lt. Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the U.S. Public Health Service and New Orleans Police Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas). The virus could turn epidemic within  hours. It's imperative that they catch Palance and halt the spread of the disease. Narrative wise, the film merges police procedurals, socially conscious message movies (which were all the rage in the s) and film noirs. Aesthetically, it mixes cinema verite with German expressionism. These juxtapositions gives rise to an odd cocktail: though shot on locations, and making heavy use of New Orlean's residents for both crowd scenes and speaking roles, the film's semi-documentary style is frequently interrupted by more expressionistic flourishes (ominous shadows, creepy dwarfs etc). End result: a fast paced race against time elevated by director Elia Kazan's hybrid style. Kazan was at the top of his game during this period, so the film flows like breeze, with pacey dialogue, atmospheric locations, great camera work and excellent cinematography by Joseph MacDonald. Lighting such vast, outdoor locations (dockyards, warehouses, ports etc) whilst retaining a consistently deep focus must have been a nightmare for MacDonald. More problematic is Kazan's supposed pandering to the House Un-American Activities Committee. In this regard, his characters never cease reminding us that they're all dutifully suffering poor wages and long working houses for the Greater Good. The film even has a subplot in which a news reporter, who wears his \"Freedom of Speech\" as a badge of honour, is shut down and locked away in a jail. There are some things the public doesn't need to know, the film says, and positions us to agree with. One thus can't help but feel that \"Panic in the Streets\" is Kazan's apology for his earlier flirtations with communism; the panic (communist infestations?) in the streets is warranted, the film says, but our hardworking boys have it all under control. / - Worth one viewing. great title...; In New Orleans, Blackie (Jack Palance) and his thugs attack and kill a sick man who walked out of his game after winning his money. The coroner finds something suspicious and calls in Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark). He declares it the extremely contagious pneumonic plague. He faces opposition as he tries to raise the alarm. This is a rough and meandering thriller. The most compelling thing about the movie is the title. It's a lot of cop and robber procedural. Jack Palance is a good ruffian when he's on the screen. I like the dark gritty opening. Richard Widmark is a solid tough guy. None of the other actors are quite as striking. I don't find the investigation that compelling. It would be better if lots of people start dropping dead. The real world locations are great but the movie isn't terribly thrilling. Magnificent bad guy; This story about contagion could double as an allegory about McCarthyism. Though Elia Kazan's movie is dated and melodramatic, it has a great bad guy who gives it energy. Jack Palance's oily gang kingpin steals every scene he's in. (He seems a precursor to godfather types to follow in mobster movies decades later.) His incredibly chiseled features, athletic gangliness, and sinister demeanor are consistently riveting, particularly when he's bullying pathetic fat man Zero Mostel. The atmospherics in the movie could be better. We're in New Orleans, but you wouldn't know it most of the time. The final chase scene in a coffee warehouse helps a bit. Some other aspects of \"Panic\" didn't work for me. Much as he tried to be hard-boiled, I didn't find Paul Douglas in the role of police captain that convincing. And OK, so Richard Widmark wanted to go against type and play an idealistic doctor. I never bought it,\n",
       "especially when one of his creepy laughs escaped. His wife seemed too June Cleaverish to boot. How could she not be even a tad squeamish as a pregnant woman whose husband was pursuing the plague? The implied allegory about the spread of panic (a la McCarthyism) seems a little silly nowadays. All in all, this OK movie hasn't aged too well. Entertaining film, Jack Palance is great; A very good movie directed by the talented Elia Kazan. There were a few non-professional actors, and a bit of the script and scenes seem a little corny, even amateurish, but overall, the directing, film editing, sound, camera work, and production were great. The overall story itself was also very good, maybe just a tiny bit over the top for film noir. But the acting performances by Richard Widmark, Jack Palance, Paul Douglas, Barbara Bel Geddes, Tommy Cook, Zero Mostel, and the other professional actors were all great. Now for the real attraction. I thought Jack Palance was outstanding in this film, which was his feature film debut. Although the character he played (\"Blackie\") was a very bad (but smart) criminal, and he didn't have a lot of scenes, Palance's acting performance was fantastic. There are several scenes in this movie that are now on my all-time favorites list because of Palance's presence. I liked Palance in the \"City Slickers\" films, especially the sequel, but I never realized that he was such a talented actor in his early years. This film made me a Jack Palance fan, and I began buying early films that he was in. Panic in the Streets, some cheering in the aisles; Panic In The Streets opens in high noir style, a view along a dark street followed by a camera tilt upwards to a window, behind which is playing out a sleazy card game - an opening flourish which, along with some of the location shooting, anticipates some of the atmosphere Welles brought a decade later in Touch Of Evil. One of the players throws open the window; it's an appropriate action, serving as an introduction to the events within as well as literally opening up our first view of the underworld. Shot in high contrast black and white, Panic In The Streets benefits immensely from a strong cast as well as some fine location shooting in New Orleans. Scenes set in such places as the mortuary, the crowded shipping office or amidst the peeling paint of 'Frank's Place' offer a unique, and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere, impossible to recreate in the studio. With these elements, Kazan's film shows the influence of Dassin's groundbreaking Naked City of two years earlier, which established the gritty, almost documentary style within the noir cycle. In fact, Widmark's previous role had been in Dassin's even finer Night And The City, a film in which a sense of rising panic was even more prevalent. Joe MacDonald, a favourite with the director, photographed Panic In The Streets' detailed environment. MacDonald also worked on Kazan's Pinky and Viva Zapata!, and went on to shoot Widmark again three years later in Fuller's masterpiece Pick Up On South Street. As others have noticed, in a manner typical of some noir films, Kazan's work offers a contrast between the confusion, sickness and immorality of the streets with the modest, calm home life of the Reeds. But whereas (for instance) in Lang's The Big Heat () the home life of the hero is destroyed by elements of vice surrounding the embattled central character - ultimately sending him back to work with an increased vigilance and sense of vengeance - Panic In The Streets places Reed's rising anxiousness within the confines of what amounts to just another working 'day'. Despite all the danger, ultimately he returns back to the bosom of his family justified and satisfied. The implication being that social balance has been restored, at least for the moment by his professionalism and curative skills. That imbalance of course, has been created by crime and disease. The two are closely associated in this film. It reminds one of the tagline from the much cruder Cobra () - where \"Crime is the disease. Meet the cure,\" a neat analogy in context, if one which rings too uncomfortably of social reductionism. At its climax, as Blackie attempts to flee aboard ship, the visuals specifically allude to rats as being similar to criminals, both posing a menace to society's health. As (the presumably infected) Blackie prowls round the cheap rooms and the docks with his cronies, in search of something he suspects everyone is after, if without knowing exactly what it is, 'plague' and 'Blackie' resonate together in the audiences mind, adding further to connected associations. Ironically Blackie's hunch about Poldi's unfortunate cousin, that \"he brought something in\" of note is correct - even if, finally, its nothing he can sell or steal. Blackie's logical assumption that the police would not normally bother with the murder of some anonymous illegal immigrant has a ring of truth about it, and his so confusion is understandable. Dr Reed, although home-loving, and on the side of society, is a true noir hero. Familiar to the genre is the chief protagonist as a man who walks alone, forced to travel beyond the limits of the law. In his way, Reed is forced to take morality into his own hands for the sake of society at large - a dimension of the film that is particularly apposite, given director Kazan's controversial personal history. The director testified before the infamous HUAC, naming suspected communists and fellow travellers. His film depicts suspects being hauled in for questioning, and the manhandling of the press, on the grounds that the overriding public good justified the means. These actions perhaps echo the director's sentiments at the time, presumably accepting the McCarthyite witch hunt and the suppression of civil rights it entailed in the light of presumed communist infiltration of the entertainment industry. In these times of terrorist threats and state response, such issues as they appear in the film are strikingly modern. Standout scenes in the film include a notable scene where Blackie interrogates the dying Poldi as to the precise nature of his cousin's presumed contraband. Cat like, Blackie stalks his victim across the room, eventually preying over the doomed man's sick bed, holding Poldi's feverish head in his hands - a striking, evil cradling. It's a gesture emphasising the intimate nature of corruption, whether moral or physical. Apparently, the actors did many or all of their own stunts, which leads to some other, very dramatic scenes at the end, as the police and health authorities close in on the villains under the wharfs. Half crawling, half scrambling over the slippery timbers at the edge of the dock pool must have been an experience very uncomfortable for Palance, but it is sequence that adds immensely to the immediacy of it all. Occasionally less convincing elements distract the viewer. Apparently Dr Reed is left to fight a potential national emergency little government backup. Perhaps just as astonishingly, he never inoculates himself - inviting a dramatic turn which never materialises. At the end of the film, too, the potential epidemic has been halted, all contactees located, a little too neatly. But these weaknesses are more than outweighed by the other satisfactions of a film that still makes for compulsive and relevant viewing today. Rat race against a ravaging plague epidemic; This movie garnered an Oscar for Edna and Edward Anhalt's writing of the original story for a motion picture. And, WHAT a great idea for a story this is--even today. It was shot completely on location in what used to be a truly great and important gulf port city, New Orleans, Louisiana. This movie ingeniously teams up a crotchety, skeptical policeman (Paul Douglas) with a totally devoted doctor (Richard Widmark) from the US Public Health Service, a regular branch of the service that doesn't get enough attention for ITS service to our country. Here, we get to see Widmark as the good guy for a change. He is workaholic family man struggling to make ends meet--who doesn't have enough time for wife (Barbara Bel Geddes) and his young son. As the movie opens, we see a group of gangsters playing cards in some cheap hotel room. Blackie (Jack Palance) is the boss of the gang, Fitch (Zero Mosel) is his go-for guy, and Poldi (Guy Thomajan) is another gang member. When Poldi's cousin wants to drop out of the card game because he is sick, Blackie doesn't want him to leave since he is too far ahead in the game. When he does leave, the gang chases him though the city and down to the train tracks where he is shot and left. The police discover his body the next day and have it taken to the Coroner's office for an autopsy.... We first get to know Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) and his family in the next scene. 'Clint' and his wife, Nancy (Barbara Bel Geddes), have money problems (and bill collectors) which worry them. But, right now, Clint is trying to take some time off from work to spend it his young son who he hardly ever sees because of his job... When the coroner's autopsy reveals that the man's body is loaded with pneumonic plague---a disease related to bubonic plague but more serious since it can be so easily contracted from sneezing, sputum, or simple contact--the Coroner's office calls in Clint to handle the possible effects of a ravaging plague epidemic. Clint immediately calls for help from the NOPD. He needs them to help quickly find, and contain, the source of the plague before it spreads. Clint is teamed with a cynical Police Captain, Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who doesn't care much for doctors or Navy men. (In fact, though Clint's uniform may look like that of a Navy officer, the US Public Health Service and the Navy have nothing whatsoever to do with each other.) Tom and Clint soon learn to work together as they realize each other's roles in the almost impossible mission of finding where the dead man came from while keeping their search 'under wraps' to prevent any possible panic. Added to the difficulty of finding where the dead man came from is the fact that his body, and therefore the dead man's ID, was immediately incinerated to prevent contagion. Also, they have to work fast since the incubation period is only  hours. As Clint and Tom chase down clues, they are eventually led to a restaurant in a Greek neighborhood. They find out that the restaurant owner's wife had suddenly died of a high fever. This brings them closer to the plague's source than they had ever been; it brings them close to where Poldi in now lying sick in his mother's apartment. Poldi's mother had ordered a nurse, who had reported his symptoms to a local hospital and ordered an ambulance. On the other hand, when Blackie and Fitch find Poldi, they believe that he and his cousin had been into something with a VERY big payoff. (After allin their minds--why else wold the whole police department be looking SO hard to find Poldi and his cousin?) Blackie assumes that Poldi's cousin must have been in on a huge drug haul and Poldi must know about it. They try to pump Poldi for information before he dies. But, he is too sick to tell them anything. As Blackie and Fitch try to carry Poldi out of his mother's upstairs apartment, they meet Clint and Tom on the steps, throw Poldi down the steps, and are chased by the police. The final running foot-chase sequence, with the police in hot pursuit of Blackie and Fitch, is one of the best of it kind in film noir! The foot-chase takes us to the docks and in the warehouses and back streets of New Orleans. The two gangsters are seen on the levees, structures, and substructures of the once-famous gulf port city. The noir shots of Blackie and Fitch (Palance and Mosel) running across structures, popping up and dropping down from one level of a coffee and banana warehouse to another is almost visually poetic. In fact, they remind us of rats crawling along beams, bridges and other structures (occasionally falling in the swampy water only to get up and run some more). The rat analogy reminds us of the plague that ships sometime bring into ports and refocuses us on WHY the two are being chased in the first place: to stop and control an possible plague epidemic. After Fitch has been shot dead, the final rat-plague analogy is brought home as we see Blackie climbing a fruit freighter's line. He falls to his death, not by a bullet from the police, but by the line's rat catcher. featuring Jack g-ddamn Palance!; This was Jack Palance's debut in films as an actor (or should I say \"Walter\" Jack Palance, for some reason that's there in the credits), and he eats up every second of film he has. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and in a way it helps to lift up a character who has little dimension. He doesn't need it, you could argue: he's a thug who wants his money, that's it, and will do anything he can to get it (this may include killing, of course, which we see very early on as the thing that kicks off much of the story). He is imposing too physically, with that chiseled face and tall frame - at one point he talks to someone who is quite short and the difference between the two is like night and day - and he also is believable to the point where you realize why Zero Mostel (also very good as the talky-kinda-dumb lackey) is so subservient. Not much depth, no, but who needs depth when Palance can kick your ass any way to Sunday? In this story it's a film-noir but unique in that it's focus is not about a man-hunt only for the killer, but because of a plague (not the Bubonic plague, the other one the Numonic plague or other, the one that you just need to know is around now), and Richard Widmark plays the stalwart, headstrong doctor who will get his job done to catch the people infected (or even those, especially those, who may not be yet) into quarantine and given shots and so on. He's up against cops (including a sometimes-sympathetic-sometimes-not Paul Douglas), and a bevvy of other cops and reporters. Some of the early scenes with Widmark's family is pretty standard - he has a nice and loving and family, OK, that's fine - but once that's out of the way the story kicks in and it has a natural momentum to it. An outbreak or contagion-type of story is intrinsically dramatic because it brings people together - or, on the flip-side, it drives people apart and shows what self-interested idiots people can be some/most of the time. I don't know if Kazan meant for this to have deeper sociological meaning like On the Waterfront. Maybe the hunt for the people who've come in contact with the infected is a euphemism for Communism, or maybe not, it doesn't seem as cut and dry to me as in the latter film. In any case Panic in the Streets is engaging and enjoyable as a no-frills thriller, a picture that uses human nature and the lack of speaking up about something grave and dangerous as a way of forward momentum - who will speak up first, who won't - and if you want a simple cops and criminals chase story you get that also. I think it holds up most of all due to the performances though, even including the story, since Widmark, Panace, Mostel et al beef up the material with the kind of emotion that I'm sure Kazan was great at coaxing out of his actors (whether it was making them relaxed enough or getting them into the 'method' of it in the case of Palance I don't know). What a chase; Kazan's early film noir won an Oscar. Some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism, and rate it very highly. I can almost see where they are coming from. But I prefer to take a more toned-down approach to a long-forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi-documentary fashion. Pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to a military doctor (Widmark) and a city detective (Douglas) to apprehend the main carrier (Palance). The film is moody, shot in stark black and white, and makes very good use of locations. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Forget the symbolism (crime equals disease, and disease equals crime) and just enjoy the chase. It is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century, as it is of a particular style that was very short-lived (post WWII through the early s) and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher. For those who will be watching this for the first time, sit tight for the big chase at the end. It is something else, and frankly I don't know how they filmed some of it. I can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first  percent of the movie. Starts superbly, than opts, regrettably, for convention.; PANIC opens brilliantly with two sequences that set out its stall as a noir-melodrama: the poker game gone wrong, and the strained conversation of a doctor with his wife and son: the first is rich in metaphysical horror, the second in social and emotional power, and both are told with rare cinematic Kazan skill.  It is distressing, therefore, to see the film taking the dullest of its many options, offering an entirely predictable buddy-buddy chase-the-gangster movie, which is probably about Reds Under The Beds, but certainly isn't about excitement and invention.  There is too much talk, although you've got to see Jack Palance throwing a dying man off a stairwell in front of his mother. How similar to today's repressive and explosive situation; Think the media is full of lying prostitutes to the truth, controlled by corporate America? Then the fight between the police captain, the public health officer and the reporter will be of interest to you. Interesting counter-play between the right of the public to know the plague is loose and the attempts by Widmark and Douglass to contain the panic. Unfortunately, that also causes more deaths, since they don't get the co-operation they would have had if they had told some of the people, and a woman dies. A Little irrational, since many people were waylaid by the plague-carrying human rats and you don't get the feeling they were all inoculated, but it was definitely well-staged. New Orleans has never looked seedier. Jack Palance has never looked more menacing, and Widmark was a nice guy, for a change. The acting is top notch, and Kazan, not my favorite human being because of his own 'rat-like' qualities, naming names before the witch hunting McCarthy Commission, did a good job of directing. Too bad he ruined the careers of so many good actors, Zero Mostel included (and this was his last picture for many years because of it). Check this one out. The DVD has a lot of interesting information. Another prime Cold War thriller; With the Cold War kicking into gear, this movie  in a way, like the Body Snatchers movies that followed it  focuses on the chaos of panic, here brought about by a deadly disease, a plague. Tense and at times terrifying, Panic in the Streets is electric gold as far as the genre is concerned. It's tightly written, although viewed through the glass of  a little simplistic at times (see below), and expertly acted. It all starts when a man is smuggled onto a boat that docks in New Orleans. The man then visits a poker game with his cousin and winds up winning a lot of money from a gangster named Blackie (Jack Palance, in his debut). When the man, rather than risk his winnings to give Blackie a chance to win them back, takes off, he's cornered by Blackie and his henchmen, then shot to death and dragged into the river, where he's discovered the next morning. But when the coroner examines the body, he finds something suspicious. Yes, a bullet ended the man's life, but he was already dying. Enter Health Inspector Clint Reed (Richard Widmark), who immediately recognizes the disease as pneumonic plague, which  and I don't know this to be scientific fact  is extremely contagious. Reed must find the man's cousin, the Patient Zero, before he can unwittingly pass the illness  which is fatal  along to the rest of the city, even the world. He's teamed up with crusty police chief Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who's not sure the doctor's right but is smart enough to follow orders anyway, however reluctantly. It doesn't take long for him to be convinced that there is cause for panic and that the city as a whole must be quietly quarantined, if plausible. The chemistry between Douglas and Widmark drives the script. Palance is a terrific menace, as he would go on to be in countless movies. Zero Mostel is on hand as one of his henchmen; Barbara Bel Geddes plays Reed's wife. The men are in a race against time, figuring they have less than  hours to find their Patient Zero. Warren's police work and Douglas' medical knowledge help them retrace the smuggled man's footsteps and those of the newly infected as well. If I'm going to gripe about anything, it's the ease with which Reed eradicates the disease. What's that, you say? You may have encountered the sick man? Here, we'll inoculate you, all better. Not sure that's how inoculation works, really, but I'll suspend disbelief for this movie on the grounds that it was a lot of fun to watch. Very well done.; Intense, gripping drama / thriller from director Elia Kazan, set in New Orleans. A gang of lowlife criminals murder one of their own, not knowing the man was carrying pneumonic plague. A stubborn public health doctor, Clinton Reed (the excellent Richard Widmark, playing a somewhat flawed yet still likable hero) figures things out and does his damnedest to try to prevent the disease from spreading, with the sometimes reluctant help of police captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas). The movie does have an appropriate amount of atmosphere in some of its scenes, particularly in the opening, but for the most part actually takes place in the day time, and truthfully isn't in a typical film noir type of mode. Kazan, however, would strive for realism at all times, casting many locals to basically play themselves. He does allow the pace to slow at times, giving Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes a crucial character driven scene that both lets the actors show off their chops and effectively humanize their characters. But the story does have a fine forward momentum nevertheless, leading to a climactic chase scene. Concocted by Edward and Edna Anhalt (adapted by Daniel Fuchs, and scripted by Richard Murphy), who won an Oscar for it, it serves as a potent forerunner of more recent movies such as \"Outbreak\" (In fact, the working title of this movie *was* \"Outbreak\"!). It gets a lot of effectiveness from its often antagonistic interplay between its actors, especially leads Widmark and Douglas, as well as the pivotal casting of soon-to-be legend (Walter) Jack Palance, in his first major screen role; he makes for a wonderful heavy (naturally), with an amazing physical presence and that instantly recognizable visage. Zero Mostel is quite a hoot as his more nebbish-y accomplice; other performers such as Lewis Charles (as the doomed man at the beginning), Emile Meyer as the hostile Nile Queen captain (with him, Palance, and Douglas on hand, \"Panic in the Streets\" doesn't lack for real tough guys in its cast), and Guy Thomajan as the flunky Poldi also do quite well; Tommy Rettig of 'Lassie' fame plays Reed's son and director Kazan can be seen as Cleaver, the mortuary assistant. Overall, a highly enjoyable and stylish movie, with Kazan going more for long shots than close ups, that entertains sharply from beginning to end. Eight out of . Highly Recommended; Many years ago, I saw Panic in the Streets on the late movie and it introduced me to what was to become one of my favorite sub-genres of movies, documentaries and non-fiction books:  the pursuit of deadly disease. Richard Widmark stars as a doctor in the US Public Health Service chasing down a killer (excellently played by Jack Palance) who is  carrying pneumonic plague, the deadlier airborne version of bubonic plague.  Widmark and Paul Douglas, as a New Orleans cop, have only  hours to stop the killer and everyone he meets before the plague becomes epidemic in the crowded, impoverished streets of New Orleans. Panic in the Streets was directed by Elia Kazan just before he did A Streetcar Named Desire.  Although by no means as brilliant as Streetcar or his later On the Waterfront, Panic is an excellent movie on many levels.  It works well as a noir thriller, but equally well as a warning of the dangers epidemic disease long before anyone ever heard of ebola, anthrax or west Nile.  Kazan himself, thought of Panic as his first \"real\" movie, despite the fact that he had already made Pinky and Gentleman's Agreement. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes Elia Kazan, or noir, or a first class medical thriller. Great Cast; Panic in the Streets () *** (out of ) Tense thriller about a doctor (Richard Widmark) and cop (Paul Douglas) who are trying to track down a gang of thugs who might just be carrying a pneumonia plague. The men have -hours to try and locate those with the plague or face the danger of it spreading throughout the country. Outside a few logical flaws, this is an extremely well-made and wonderfully acted thriller that manages to capture some great action as well as a lot of nice undertones. I think what I enjoyed most here was the frustration that kept growing for the doctor and cop simply because everyone refused to help them out. I liked how the dark side of New Orleans is shown and how the entire problem could have been over in the matter of minutes had someone simply opened their mouths and said what they knew. I think this was one of the best aspects of the film as the men had to constantly plead their case and the doctor was constantly trying to convince people that the plague was real and that he wasn't just blowing things up. I wouldn't call this a film noir like it's been labeled but as a thriller we get some great drama with the threat of the virus spreading but the film also works well as a crime picture due in large part to Jack Palance, in his film debut, playing the thug who refuses to get caught. Palance, with that dark black hair and outfit, is perfect in the role of the criminal and you have no problem believing that people would really fear him. Palance comes off incredibly menacing and just as threatening as the plague itself. Widmark and Douglas were two masters at playing fast-talking and tough characters and seeing them together just doubles all the fun. I really enjoyed how both men played their own style of toughness yet they worked so incredibly well together that you would just love to see other movies based around these characters. Both actors have no problems getting into their roles and deliver extremely strong work. Zero Mostel is wonderful as well as another one of the thugs and Barbara Bel Geddes gets to shine in her few scenes as Widmark's wife. I think there are a few logical issues like the entire thing being kept so quiet. I seriously doubt outside agencies wouldn't have been called in if there really was a threat of this thing spreading across the country. The real plague would have also been a lot uglier than what's shown here but it's understandable that they'd cut back just because of the time this was released. Kazan's direction is top-notch throughout as is the terrific music score. The cinematography is pretty much a character of its own as we get some wonderful shots including one sequence where the original sick man is stumbling through the streets with the other thugs following him.</td>\n",

                                                                                                                         A Spielberg Styled 'Family' Horror Film!; This is not a \"Monster on the Rampage\" monster film, but is squarely in the mode of Steven Spielberg's focus on family-in-peril / search for family themes that are found in virtually all of the science-fiction films Spielberg has written or produced, from 'Jaws' () up to his masterpiece 'War of the Worlds' (), both of which are highly suggested by this film. It's the story of a three generation Korean family and how they 'grow up' and adapt to a severe crisis. The crisis happens to be a giant fish-frog type monster (a product of river pollution, which lives in the Han River and its sewers) which snatches the family's youngest grandchild. This is not a kiddie film, but one that can appeal to everyone, because the focus is squarely on the individual family members and how they adapt to the crisis. As such, it may seem boring to Monster Fans, but so what. This is a well made film. In the amazing beginning, we are introduced to the hardworking grandfather, his two sons and daughter, and his granddaughter. The father is a lazy dead beat dad, the other brother an alcoholic, and the daughter a bow and arrow Olympian who chokes up and loses the gold. Then, the monster, huge and really a gross out, attacks the river bank and starts eating people and snatching the granddaughter, before leaping, frog like, back into the river. Wow! What a beginning! Others may become disappointed that the movie is not totally played for monster scares, but instead focuses on the family members and their quest to recover the granddaughter. This comprises most of the film, but if you just go with it, you'll enjoy it; especially watching it the second time, knowing how carefully this film has been constructed. I give it an . Humorous note: For fun, turn on both the English dubbing and the English subtitles. They frequently don't match and are completely different! Loses something in the translation...yet creativity carries the movie...; \"The Host\" is dubbed rather clumsily which is somewhat overcome by the creative and original storyline. The night scenes are very dark and difficult to interpret, but the monster holds up wonderfully in broad daylight. Character development is good, something most monster movies neglect entirely. My main objection would be the film trying to do too much and not quite tying everything together. Make no mistake, this is no man in a suit, plodding monster movie. \"The Host\" does not follow the typical plot line of this type film. There are surprises, tender moments, great locations, and people you actually care about. One more thing. The monster is fast and vicious. - MERK Believable characters and moments that will make you jump out of your chair.....; I happened to watch this tonight at the cinema although I don't speak or understand Korean... let alone Japanese...however it wasn't difficult to grasp the story or get caught up with the characters and the situation. This film is comical in parts and borders on science fiction, drama and even horror, but it is really fantastic to watch and displays a lot of emotion and realistic reactions. The special effects are excellent, the characters are believable and it is one movie well worth watching even if it is in a different language. There is nothing like a creature from hell to add a bit of excitement to your day.... For the first time ever I knocked over my coke and jumped  feet out of my seat when I was suddenly and unexpectedly given the fright of my life....for those of you that like this kind of excitement....be on the watch out for this little gem. (Subtitles would be an idea). I highly recommend this film and cant wait to buy it and own it on DVD!!!! Wicked-Funny Movie with \"Laugh-tears\"; LISTEN UP, because this is something new: when the monster appears in full view at the very start, it means that THE MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT THE MONSTER-- I'm still trying to count how many clichés and stereotypes were introduced along with the monster. And the fact that it had the first \"original\" monster I've seen in years, with its own peculiar pattern of movements and behavior, was not what made me laugh, cry and shout, \"There, there it is!\" (a \"live theatre\" experience). But there are  things to be gotten out of the way for \"international audiences\"-- ) If you have no idea what East Asia went through during the various health scares just after the year , you may fault this movie for being \"over-the-top\"-- when in fact, its portrayal of human reaction is quite \"realistic\". ) If you can't deal with \"laugh-tears\" or the way Korean/ Eastern genre movies \"mix genres\" and disobey the \"catharsis\" principle requiring \"pure\" comedy, OR tragedy, etc.), then you will only be able to appreciate the parts of the movie \"belong\" to genre which you classify it into (\"comedy\", OR \"tragedy\", etc.). Entertaining, but you'll be confused if you try to follow the plot.; Seven Thoughts on The Host: First, I couldn't find anything to do with a \"host.\" Maybe, \"The Mutant.\" Something was definitely off in the translation. Second, do all Korean movies introduce random, yet very essential characters, at the end of the film? Third, I laughed out loud at the very, VERY dry-humored moments, but they contrast greatly with most of the scenes that follow. None of the quotes on the DVD package even hinted that it would be comedy. But if you don't treat it as one, you'll be very disappointed. Fourth, did the makers develop the plot during the process of the film shoot? Fifth, don't watch it dubbed. Switch it to subtitles and let them speak Korean. The movie improves dramatically. Sixth, I'd rent it once, but there's no way in hell I'd buy this. Seventh, The Host reminded me a lot of V for Vendetta--both have their dark moments that are brightened by extremely dry characters, all with a political undertone. Of course V for Vendetta was supposed to be a comic-book style movie... The Host is supposed to be a Thriller/Horror/Monster Movie/Comedy... I still don't know what category to put it under. And neither will you if you really think about it. The Host; The Host is by far one of the best monster movies in years. The movie follows a bumbling young father, Gang-Do Park, and his family. The story starts like every monster movie; everything is calm and uneventful, \"business as usual\" you might say. When a mutated fish creature comes along the river bank and begins killing anyone in its path. Amidst all of the confusion, Gang-Do's daughter, Hyun-seo, is picked up by the monster and dragged back to the sewer. The story then turns into a search for Hyun-seo. Gang-Do and his family evade the authorities and use all the money they have to desperately continue their quest. The reason I picked up this movie in the first place is because the box said that it was \"on par with Jaws.\" I found this hard to believe but the monster in The Host is the one of the most cinematically pleasing CG creations in recent years and is probably the most original looking monster since Alien. It was legitimately scary looking and had a very unique style of moving that set it apart from previous monsters. Another strength of this monster is how well the CG is done. It does not just look like some computer generated figure spliced into live action footage. It looks like it belongs in the shot. The monster also has enough on screen time to make the movie suspenseful. The movie keeps the viewer wanting to see more of the monster while, at the same time, keeping them satisfied with the number of appearances. The Park family does a pretty good job of keeping the audience entertained while the monster is off screen. The relationship that Gang-Do shares with his father, \"college man\" brother, and professional archer sister maintains a balance of drama and humor that the audience can appreciate. This dynamic seems strange but the movie makes it work. You start to really feel like these people are family. The best thing about these characters is that you are not disappointed when they are on the screen. Some monster movies seem to get kind of boring when the monster is off screen (Godzilla ). The weakest thing about this movie, as it is with most foreign films, is the English translation and dubbing. After a while it becomes bearable but in the beginning it sounds absolutely awful. I don't say this very often because, like many Americans, I hate reading subtitles. But I think this one time I would have made the exception because the voice acting was just terrible. They just didn't seem to fit the characters very well. The dialogue in some scenes is very awkward as well. Some of the English translation just sounds out of place. This happens a lot with language barriers, however, and sometimes it just cannot be helped. If you want to watch something that is not meant to be in your language, you've just got to go with what you get. I started off saying that this is one of the best monster movies in years, and it is. It's not perfect, but what monster movie is? It has some flaws but the originality of the monster and the simplicity of the plot makes this movie very easy to follow and worth watching at the very least. It is pretty good for what it is. The whole \"monster terrorizing an Asian town\" seems like it has been done a million times (because it has), but this movie has some new things to offer. Would I call this movie \"on par with Jaws\"? I wouldn't personally, but it is definitely better than some of the cheesy messes that monster movies have made in the past. Monster; Quarantined after coming in contact with an amphibious sea monster, a slow-witted man flees and searches for his daughter when nobody else believes she has survived the monster attack in this South Korean horror movie. Powered by incredible special effects, 'The Host' has some breathtaking moments as the creature leaps around the infrastructure of Seoul with acrobatic precision; scenes of it plowing mercilessly into crowds have quite an impact too. The bits without the monster are a lot less engaging though. Part of the issue is that the characters are hard to warm to. Kang-ho Song is the most likable with his dedication to his daughter, yet the film uncomfortably plays his social awkwardness and dimwitted nature for laughs. The other issue is that the film packs too much in thematically without exploring every issue. Subplots include thoughtless disposal of dangerous chemicals, government paranoia, a possible virus, and the conviction of government agents that the protagonist is slow-witted due to being infected by the monster. The film has received considerable praise over the years for raising so many ideas, but with none explored in particular depth, this is a film that only really comes alive when the monster is on screen. Fortunately though, it is a great-looking creature, and one that always seems more confused by its human surroundings than genuinely evil. Total Crap with good special effects; I don't know how this train wreck of a movie was able to garner any awards other than through bribery. If you can make it through the first five minutes of this lunacy  pouring chemicals down the drain because their bottles are dusty  then perhaps you'll understand what you're in for. Be prepared for a lot of bad acting, bad directing and a bad storyline (that is\n",
       "if you can pick one of the many they chose). In regards to the acting\n",
       "I'm speechless (as such, I'd be a better actor than some of these people). As far as directing: there's one scene that was shot out of focus\n",
       "I think that should give you an idea of the rest of the movie. Now storyline: Which one to complain about  The family feud, the old man with the shop (who can't act), the drunken uncle (who can't act), the loser son (who can't act) with daughter (best actress in the film), a scary monster, a pandemic, Americans trying to muscle in on the poor Koreans who don't want them there...they're all bad. It could have been good if only they chose to focus on one. This movie is just a disaster. The one saving grace are the special effects. Aside from that, don't listen to all the other people who gave this movie  stars  they've obviously been paid. Weird; It may be weird but it's sure as heck entertaining. From the Korean film industry you have a good idea. What would happen if a monster lived in the Han River ( a bit like The Loch Ness Monster) and thus the idea for this film was born. All the locations are real, even the sewer isn't a set. That's a real sewer! The actors are very good, we're following the fortunes and misfortunes of the Park family. Gramps the alcoholic, Dad who runs a food stand, brother is a failed college graduate, sister is a world class archer and and grand daughter in school. Basically this film is a kidnap film where the grand daughter is taken by the monster and dad and the others have to overcome many trials to save her life. The effects for the creature were all done in the US and it looks pretty darn good. The story holds up well, the plot is fairly decent and all the actors are excellent. Don't worry about it being subtitled, it's still very easy to watch and highly enjoyable. A pretty solid effort, but needed more Creature!; The directors \"Memories of murder\" was very good, yet went on a little too long as did \"The Host.\" Now I love a decent two hour plus movie, but it has to have something going on interesting during some of the duller parts of the scripts. I would not have cut not a lot but probably - minutes worth and it would have been a better flick. Whoever decided to go over to the Best special effects companies (Oscar winning Weta was one) to do their flick and pay a little more to get it done Right, was/is the biggest reason why the film looks so good. Seriously the best script in the world that has a giant creature as the main character, and used special effects that suck (Ahem Sci-Fi channel movie quality I mean) no one would have watched it or enjoyed it as much. Now I liked the film quite a bit, but not nearly as much as so many others. The first hour in particular, (except for a few heart-pounding sequences) was really slow getting going. I also felt that we never really got much of a grasp or a good understanding of all the main characters. While in \"Alien\" we get to know all of the main characters quite well, and care about what happens to them. The one character we did get to know pretty well was the girls father, and it was written well, and he grew the most of the main characters. I liked this and maybe in subsequent viewings I will catch more and enjoy it even more. Overall the acting was top-notch in most parts, but if anyone watches this not in the native language of Korean, you will be sorry. The Dubbing, (at least the English dubbing) is absolutely atrocious, embarrassing, and will ruin the film. I don't know who does the dubbing, but it is just terrible! (Of course just about all of them are) This is a fun monster movie, but the monster unfortunately In my opinion is barely used and seems like a waste to not involve the creature a little more in movie. This is no Alien, but it is a valiant effort and will go down as a pretty solid monster movie. Yeah...is this the right movie?; Believe me, I was excited to see this one. I'm always excited when I get a chance to see a new movie, especially if I've heard great things about it. But this wasn't just a great new flick, it was also supposed to be the \"best monster movie since Godzilla\". Apparently, the genre is pretty easily satisfied. Now I'm not going to say it was horrible, because it wasn't. There was some comedy I appreciated (mostly because I'm racist and I think that people from Asian countries have an unhealthy obsession with disease) and there were some valid jabs at the shortcomings of bureaucracy. There were some very well developed characters. But it was slow, and quite a few of the scenes were just tedious as hell. And they shouldn't have been. This could have been a great film, and I think everyone involved in production (including the CG artists) just came up short. If it's on late at night and you've got nothing else to watch- sure. But don't go out of your way for this one, you'll be pretty disappointed. Reflect the gloomy side of Korea; The movie seems to be just a monster movie. But i think it might reflect the gloomy side of Korea. So i want to talk about it. There's a family that operates a small snack bar on Han river. It looks like ordinary times. KangDu(who is the main character and Hyunseo's father)is sleeping. But suddenly, something appears in the river. It was taking pictures of people. and it was stretching its body. It is a monster which has made toxic chemicals from the U.S. army. It kills people and eats them. Everyone is in a panic. Then, they are running away from the Han river. KangDu is running away with Hyunseo,too. But he missed her hand. She was eaten by the monster. After the monster hid away, there was a joint funeral. Every member of KangDu's family came for HyunSeo. There are HeeBong, who is KangDu's father, NamIl and NamJu who are KangDu's younger broter and sister. They sob in front of Hyunseo's picture. And the journalists keep taking pictures of them for their benefit. The government authorities can't explain this situation. The bereaved family don't know why those who were loved had died, and don't know why they had to die. The government kept them away from the answer. They just told them \"We can't explain. Because we don't have much time. So watch TV.\" But there's no TV which report accurate information. So they press the government. Then the government gets into a corner and isolates them. At the same time, the news announces the Virus only and the other nations believe that only. And then, the TV shows a U.S. soldier as a 'Hero' who was \"made\" the monster. KangDu called his daughter. So told the government about this. But they ignored him and they even threatened him. At the pressing situation, we are barbarians to them. The only way of survival is with her family. They take decisive action escape the isolation. A company which help them to escape aimed at the money. They paid everything, and they were broke. At that time, the news announced KangDu's family escaped everywhere. On the TV news, they were treated like dreadful criminals. That means the Assailant becomes the Hero, and the Victims become the Assailants. The government and the press chased the family, not a monster. They went to the Han river to save Hyunseo. In that situation, the private enterprise paid the government workers. The government workers aim at the money, not the rescue. Now, the family is fighting with an invisible enemy. When the government protections crumbled, other victims appeared. The nation let the people alone. When they(the family) have a late dinner, they imagine being with her. They miss the ordinary times. Finally, they meet the monster. They are fighters with guns who were normal people before. The soldiers get near them because of the gun shot. But in the end, Heebong passed away because of the monster. At that moment, they run away from the nation and the world feels pity for the U.S. soldier's death, not their father's. The family members who chased the monster fall down one by one. Actually, there was no virus. The government wasted time, during that period so many people were dying. HyunSeo is tired, so she decides to escape herself. But eventually she was swallowed by the monster. When the family found her, she already died. After all, the monster died. But the last time, only the family fought the monster. The time passes. Now, KangDu can't sleep and he always feels nervous. The TV still shows stupid news, and the news is of no value. P.S.) In the Prologue, a man takes his own life in the Han river. The desperate man can see something inside the river. But the other guys can't see that. It may mean you can't see if you aren't interested. A rousing success and a ton of fun; An irresponsible U.S. Army doctor has his Korean aid dump a large quantity of toxic chemicals into the sink. The chemicals drain straight into the Han River with an unexpected and disastrous result. The chemicals are responsible for the creation of a giant mutant monster with a taste for human flesh. The creature goes on a rampage and takes a girl named Hyun-seo into the river. She is presumed dead until her father receives a garbled call from Hyun-seo's cell phone. Is she really alive? Hyun-seo's family takes to the sewers in search of her. I've been a fan of Creature Features for as long as I can remember. I grew up on stuff like Godzilla, Rodan, and the other multitude of giant creatures attacking every major city on the planet. With The Host, we have a new giant creature for a new millennium. And for the most part, it's a rousing success and a ton of fun. The opening scenes are some of the best and most believable (if any of this stuff can really be called believable) giant creature on a rampage that I've ever seen. The creature design is great. It's just what I would picture from a something horribly mutated by toxic chemicals. And I can't think of many movies where CGI was used better or more appropriately. It's really quite phenomenal. Equally amazing is the mix of humor and horror present in The Host. Some scenes are creepy while others had me all but laughing out loud. And then there's the ending. I'm not going to give it away, so I'll just say that it's much more touching than I could have imagined. It all but brought a tear to my eye. Overall, The Host features quite an intelligent, well-written script and is surely one of the better movies of this type I've seen in a long time. As much as I enjoyed The Host, it's far from perfect. To begin with, I tend to agree with some of those who found the second act disappointing. It's not that the middle portion of the movie is bad or anything, it's just not the thrill-a-minute of the opening scenes. My other problem relates to the film's anti-American stance. While I would agree that the filmmakers have every right to express whatever political opinion they may have, it's a bit overdone and too obvious in my opinion. Best Creature Film In Years...; \"The Host\" is just another reason why Koreans are quickly emerging as the most creative, personal, and daring filmmakers working today. Circumventing around the illegal dumping of toxic chemicals, a busy Korean river becomes home to a large carnivorous sea-creature. It's bipedal ability gives it access to the bustling river shore where hundreds of citizens flock each day, and where a particular \"down on their luck\" family runs a convenience stand. After a terrific opening action sequence with the said monster attacking, and scores upon scores of people running for their lives, the beast leaps away into the water with a small girl in grasp. The girl, the daughter of one of the aforementioned stand owners is thought dead until certain plot changes arise, and the characters set off for the child. Of course though, there are other plot transitions that add depth to each character, as well blockades to their progress, but this film is really at its best when the creature is on screen and the action is in full throttle. The acting is great with touches of comedy here and there, and the direction, music, and cinematography all add to the experience. There's even room for a few morality lessons if one is privy to listen. Though \"The Host\" isn't exactly a horror film, it does have thrills and adventure similar to \"Jurassic Park,\" and mixes realism with fantasy very convincingly. All in all, it's a very cool film that puts Hollywood horror flicks to shame. Very disappointed I spent £ renting this; I have no idea why other people have given raving reviews about this film. In my opinion this film started off really well getting straight to the action in a few minutes from the start. After the first half hour though everything seems to slow down like you're wading through a thick bog. The only decent bits after that were when the monster reappeared and I actually got so fed up that I ended up using the fast forward button through most of the story. The \"dad\" of the young girl annoyed me so much that I desperately wanted him to be eaten or killed or whatever. Any person who tries to explain his daughter being taken by a monster by miming the scene using a phone, his mouth and a bin should be shot. Sadly this wasn't the case. Good CGI but the film could've been cut down by at least mins from its near  hour length. Iconic and brilliant!; When there are tourists and travelers walking up and down the banks of the Han river in Seoul asking where the best place to see the 'Monster from the Han river' is, you know there is something big behind it all. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux_bStefZAo And that is 'The Host'. As exciting as it is iconic, this urban creature feature became the highest grossing Korean film in the history of the country, it's moody locations and grim tone (how many films dare turn a memorial service into a comedy?) creating an atmosphere around the monster that lasts even after it is revealed in all its slippery glory in a fantastic daylight attack near the start of the film. For a film about a foul-smelling fish monster to feel as fresh as it does, especially after the American Godzilla seemingly destroyed the genre over a decade ago, is quite an achievement. Bring on 'The Host II', and keep those tourists patrolling the Korean waterways for signs of the beast! Seen this one before...; I saw it the first time when it was called \"The Relic\". Same looking monster, just a worse story line. And unfortunately, the monster is the only good thing about this movie. Obviously the acting isn't going to be good (especially since it was dubbed), but I wasn't looking for good acting in a \"monster movie\". The movie is a little less than two hours, and there is maybe only  minutes total that was entertaining. I give the special effects team credit though. They took a monster from a previous movie that had hair, and turned it into a monster with scales instead. Bravo...fantastic imagination! If you liked The Relic, you will be very disappointed in The Host. Best monster movie in a long time..; * may contain spoilers * This movie was an unpredictable, light, frightening, and humorous rescue/horror. The characters each have distinct issues, and there exists a tension but togetherness in the family that is all too realistic. The plot line is disjoint, but is superbly executed -- the story weaves around character to character and subplot to subplot getting increasingly disjoint until the final scenes. The monster in the movie is excellently portrayed, and at no stage did I empathise, anthropomorphise, or predict the actions or intentions of it. I felt a great sense of desperation and surprise watching this movie, and highly recommend it to everyone. The best Monster Movie of the last decade; The Host is a  Korean film, directed by Bong Joon-Ho. The film starts out as the classic Monster StoryTelling, alas an error committed by human injures nature, and because of this, a terror under the shape of a murderous creature appears, to seek revenge. The monster is indeed well introduced, with a first mysterious appearance of a young creature, that is never actually shown on screen because of the shots, and then with a man committing suicide because he has seen \"something dark\" in the water. He's probably the same man who assisted the Doctor that ordered to dump Formaldehyde. What does indeed render The Host unique in its genre, is how this concept is later developed. The Monster itself in the end is somewhat a secondary part of the story, because in this film, the storyline is focused mainly on the human protagonists; a family that has just lost one beloved member, young Hyun-Seo (played with great skill by Ko Ah-Seong, who has been complimented even by the director himself), kidnapped and dragged into the Han River by the Monster. She is believed to be dead until a mysterious phone call is received by the half-retarded (not kidding) Protagonist Gang-Du. The family then starts seeking for the young girl, but is blocked because the creature seems to bring a deadly virus (that in reality doesn't exist, and is only a device used by the US Government), and hence they have been in the area devastated by it (Gang-Du has even attacked it resulting in some blood sprayed on his face), they are put under quarantine. They however manage to escape thanks to mercenaries hired by Hee-Bong. At this point their desperate research for Hyun-Seo begins. It turns out she is trapped in the sewers of the city, in a location that could be called the \"storeroom\" of the Monster since it lays here the captured preys only to consume them later. The scenes in which this location is featured are not much gory as one would imagine - but are indeed somewhat disturbing, especially when Gwoemul begins to vomit (literally) the bare bones of its past victims, creating what could be described as a \"Death Fountain\", and is indeed the major disturbing factor of the film. In the end the creature is killed by Gang-Du, but not before he has to acknowledge the death of his daughter, that sacrificed herself to save a kid, Se-Jo. The Monster, called Gwoemul during production (this would later become the original title of the film), is a gigantic mutant catfish, estimated to be the size of a whole truck, that has a complex Mouth Apparate, similar for those who have seen the films, to the Carnivore Plant in Jumanji, or, more strikingly, the Sandworms from Dune or the Graboids from Tremors. It has three-four claws on each toe of its main limbs, which are used for locomotion, and a row of Fins on the back. The most striking detail is the asymmetry given by what seems to be a developed bladder on the monster's left eye. A very good design indeed, that is portrayed on screen almost perfectly through CGI, created by the Orphanage, and Practical Animatronics effects, built by the well-known Weta Workshop, which also worked on the Lord of the Ring Trilogy and King Kong (). The Korean Cast does a great dramatic (if sarcastic) performance and definitely triumphs over the lifeless cast of Dragon Wars (another Korean films which doesn't use national actors as the main characters), the Big-Budgeted Korean Monster Film that came just one year later. The Host is one of those rare Monster Films that almost reach perfection, and is definitely suggested for those who search a monster crossed with a good dramatic plot, a rare event nowadays. An overall solid film; The Plot The Host, directed by Joon-ho Bong is a Korean horror (Monster) film. There are American subtitles through the entire move. It is about a creature that's mutated due to chemicals running into a public river. Done in the classic sci-fi manner of 'doctor/scientist make stupid goof up, and unleash chaos into the world', the resulting monster focuses on attacking and eating it's captives. Gang Du, played by Kang-Ho, is the titular hero of the movie, providing a very down to earth take on the protagonist role. Gang-du helps run a family owned squid and beer stand beach side with his father and daughter. When the creature makes its appearance, wreaking havoc on the beach, the family tries its best in order to rescue Gang Du's daughter. The film is good at keeping the watcher interested. It has comedic relief and is filled with drama, keeping the watcher at the edge of their seats. The story focuses more so on the relationship among the main characters, and their ambition for rescuing Gang Du's daughter. Cinematography The Cinematography is well done. It is easy to see all of the action and they keep the screen very well lit. The monster doesn't look fake and it put into the movie very well. The actors never seem blurry and show up very well. There is also little camera shaking. Watch the first scene of the movie on mute. The dialogue between the two characters feels unnatural. Rely on the images to get the story, and the images in this low key dark comedy monster flick are AMAZING! Everything in this movie supports the story to a 'T' in the imaging department. You can see the progression of the lighting from the introduction of the main character Gang-Doo, which is low contrast even inside the sack which we see later; he very contrasts even in shadows. The lighting compliments the mood of the scene, what we should feel. At the river, things are very bright and seem safe. You barely realize there is a monster running to terrorize the unsuspecting person until it's there and suddenly stuff gets real. There is a shift in lighting ratio, representing the danger by adding contrast. I always wondered why the first scene we see the monster in seems less threatening and very dangerous at the same time. The answer to this, from what I see is that it's lit for comedy. There are moments where at a very serious moment something funny happens. For example Gang-Doo grabs the wrong girl. Although it's funny, it's played serious. There moments in the movie are what make this a great movie. Acting I always find it difficult to really critic acting when they are speaking another language, Korean. First off when watching the movie you are only given a close translation of what they are saying. You don't get to have the exact wording that the actor is using. Another aspect is you must focus on the words at the bottom of the screen, which can also distract you from watching the actors. However, Kang-ho Song did do a very good job. He expressed a lot of emotion and that is very important when I don't know what he is saying. It really helps the watcher understand what is going on. The actors were also good at working with the fake monster to create the allusion that it was really attacking and eating people. There is also an English dubbed version of the film; still the exact translation is not as accurate. Sound From the beginning to the end the sound editing of the entire film was perfectly balanced and well blended. The music, the sound effects and the vocals are clearly heard. The crescendos and decrescendos really add to the suspense in the movie. At the end of the movie the flow of the music lets you know you are at the end of the movie. It really adds to the movie. Written by Mathew Case and David Veerkamp and Edited by Malcolm Ray Artistically rendered monster movie with a message; Joon-ho Bong is exactly the kind of director we need more of. Here's a director with a keen, distinctive visual style who cares about plot and characters. Most directors who display a similar mastery of the medium make slow paced, heavy films that are more about how things happen and the attitudes of the people that experience them than what actually happens. While these films often present a welcome alternative to brain dead action films it seems that there are too few films which try to find a middle ground between those two extremes. Bong has found that middle ground and the result represents the best of both worlds. With his  film Memories of Murder Bong reinvigorated the police procedural and breathed new life into one of the most hackneyed of genres. In  he turned his attention to the monster movie and The Host became the biggest box office hit of all time in his native South Korea. Unlike many blockbusters, The Host is a film which deserves its success. Although Bong shows his creature frequently and in detail he always manages to keep the focus on the human characters. The main character of the film is a slacker doofus who is unlucky enough to be in the path of the rampaging creature the first time it emerges from the sea and this event ends up shaping his destiny as he fights back against the creature and gets its viral blood on him and a few minutes later it attacks his daughter. Along with his sister, brother, and father he is then drawn into the government's rather ineffectual efforts to quarantine everyone who has had contact with the creature as they are sure it's the host of some terrible new disease. Like Godzilla before it The Host creature exists at least in part due to mankind's influence on the environment. Just as the former creature was enhanced by nuclear radiation the latter has his origins in river pollution. The Host is more obviously critical of mankind's carelessness, however, as we are shown a gutless Korean scientist agreeing to pour dangerous chemicals into a drain in order to please his American boss. This act of pollution is based on a real life incident which shows that the problems faced by developing countries like South Korea are often caused by both domestic and international elements. The continued meddling of foreign powers and the mindblowing incompetence of South Korean government agencies puts the individuals caught in the middle into an increasingly dire situation. The Host isn't quite as well made as Memories of Murder but like that film it takes an approach that makes it feel fresh even if it is undoubtedly a genre work. It also has a bit more of a \"B Movie\" tone albeit not nearly as much as one might expect based on the trailer and other publicity. If these two films are any indication Bong should be a major talent for many years to come. the longest one hundred fourteen minutes and fifty four seconds of my life; i really wanted to like this film.but it just wasn't mean to work out.not only was it all over the place in terms of tone.comedy/action/drama/adventure.some of which i'm not sure were intentional.the comedy for instance.there are also couple of scenes that don't seem to belong and are not explained,which really annoyed me.but the biggest obstacle to engaging this movie was that it just went on and on and on.i almost couldn't take it.i watched it to the end.but it was a chore.that was what killed the whole experience for me,was just how slow it was.it it hadn't been for that,i might have enjoyed the movie.the actual creature itself was not that bad looking.i have seen worse,and better.i did like the look of the film.it had a certain style to it.and the ending was touching.i started to watch the film in dubbed English but found the dubbing quality not so good,so quickly switched to Korean with English Subtitles,which i would recommend.i can't really recommend this film based on how long it seemed to take to get through,but if you do choose to watch,just know that you may need a great deal of patience A disappointment; Gwoemul (The Host) - Due to pollution in the Han river a mutated beast goes on the rampage. The youngest member of the Park family is snatched by the beast, and it is up to the rest of her family to find her, before she becomes the beast's latest meal. Firstly, I love monster movies: Mutated bears, over-sized alligators, packs of ravening Komodo dragons, the whole lot. Creature features are my favourite kind of Horror film. So, I really wanted to like The Host, but it wasn't to be. There were three major problems with it: The first can be seen with a quick look at it's IMDb page Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller Too many damned genres. It took itself too seriously to be a comedy, and yet was too light hearted to have any real message (though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement. Anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government). The drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mish-mash with all the other styles. Secondly, after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film. The central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of Korea and America, apparently, do nothing. And that's it, they just wander about, occasionally hitting one another, presumably for a bit of comedy relief. This lack of action made my attention wander, and apparently it did the same for the director, as whole plot threads go unresolved (a mystery plague invented by the evil Americans is completely forgotten about, and is never resolved). And lastly, the film is clumsily political. It paints the Americans as being stupid and evil, but gives us no American characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain. The opening scene has the most obvious stupid American vs wise Korean moment. With a Korean morgue assistant asking his boss, the coroner, not to pour chemicals into the Han river. The American coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on. As well as being racist, it's lazy film-making and there is no excuse for that. On the plus side, the monster is good, kind of a mix of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the movement effects are quite cool, and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun. There are also some nice shots in the film. Some of which remind me, strangely, of the way Firefly was filmed (shuddering cameras, out of focus shots etc).There is also a nice scene at the end, where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the family's mobile food stall. It's night-time and snow is falling, the street-lamp is giving out a cold light, but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it. Overall, I was really disappointed by this film. I'd been looking forward to a decent creature flick, and instead I get some pseudo-political,horror-comedy lite. Looking at the comments on IMDb I can't help but think that if this had been a US production it would have been slated. Just 'cause it's a foreign flick doesn't mean it's any good. There have been some great movies out of Korea in recent years (The vengeance trilogy and Brotherhood, for example), but this certainly isn't one of them. For once I'm in favour of a remake. Tighten up the directing, improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film. As it is, it's not worth a couple of hours of anyone's time. Kept me in my seat; No matter how much I am into a movie, I always have to go to the john at some point. This is the first movie in ages that I didn't have to. Whether that makes it good or not, I don't know, but at least you get an idea of how engrossing it was. I never go see monster flicks, and went to this one just because it's Korean, as I like Korean movies. Having read all the positive comments, I have to agree with a lot of them, and I learned something about monster movies in the process. However, I could never get into the \"comedy\" elements of the movie. I knew, OK, this is supposed to be funny, but in the context of the movie, I couldn't even break a smile. It's not the kind of movie where fart jokes work. People have commented about the \"ordinary\" family in this movie, but they are not an ordinary one, but an extremely dysfunctional one (at least in society's eyes) -- a la \"Independence Day\" -- which is what makes it interesting. Like most monster movies there are plot holes everywhere, which you're not supposed to think about; and the villain -- the US military and their Korean buddies -- is way too broad and obvious (not to mention that the actors are awful). A tiny detail, but I like how at the beginning of the movie in the riverside park there are not just Koreans, but foreigners mingling in (and not just blue-eyed blonde ones). It adds a touch of the everyday \"reality\" that is supposed to be the backdrop of the movie. Fun creature feature; A fun little creature feature that examines familial relationships and media manipulation along the way, THE HOST tells the tale of the Park family, a group of misfits whose patriarch runs a food stand on the banks of Seoul's Han River. His eldest son, Kang-du (Kang-ho Song), is a little slow and spends most of his time sleeping when he's not hanging out with his daughter, Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko), watching his sister blow the national archery championships. Meanwhile, Kang-du's brother is a layabout lout who can't get over his days as a young revolutionary. Things come to a crisis for the Parks when a creature rises from the depths of the Han, causing death, destruction, and dismay as it drags Hyun-seo back into the brine with it. Mudskipper Looking like a giant mudskipper, the creature makes its appearance early and not in any kind of spooky \"hidden in the shadows\" way. When it comes on the scene, everyone knows it. Luckily, the effects (at least on the small screen) are top notch which really adds to the excitement. After the attack, everyone present (and still breathing) is taken to a government-run shelter. An American present at the attack is diagnosed with a virus and the word is spread that the creature is its host (thus the title). The only other person exposed as much to the dreaded fish is Kang-du. Already distraught enough about the loss of his daughter, he's soon taken aside for some surely painful tests. Little does he know that Hyun-seo is still alive; a prisoner of the creature in its sewer lair. When she places a brief call to Kang-du he tries to get his captors to believe him. Alas, no one in authority in THE HOST gives any credence to anyone other than other authority figures. Kang-du and the rest of the Parks easily escape the lame excuse for a quarantine center and begin their futile search for Hyun-seo through the sewers of Seoul. I won't go on any more lest I give something away. Suffice to say that this is another fine play on a genre film by Joon-ho Bong. The last work I saw from him was MEMORIES OF MURDER (see Cashiers du Cinemart #), a fine play on the serial killer film. This time out he presents a rather fully-realized work that could have simply been a fish tale. Recommended.   \n",
       "11124  Long forgotten Kazan Gem Has Contempory Message.; I had forgotten this movie until I saw it again on the the satellite. You can feel, see and smell the New Orleans of , thanks to Kazan, his cast and script. A few months ago, the fear and problem of a biological bomb would seem fictional. Today, not so. This movie is almost a precursor of today. We have dedicated men in law enforcement and the medical community trying to catch the carriers of the disease. They have to bend a few rules to catch them. The bad guys Jack Palance and Zero Mostel play off each other perfectly. The one domineering and evil, the other passive and pathetic. I like the movie because Richard Widmark and the police Captain played by Paul Douglas are portrayed as guys just getting by financially, but the most important guys in town while the bugs are loose. Great Movie. Minor Work from a Cinema Great; \"Panic in the Streets\" is a pretty standard B-movie that is raised a notch above other standard B-movies by its direction. Elia Kazan could take just about any material and make it better than it would otherwise have been in the hands of many others, and this film is no exception. It's a high-concept film: a murdered man's body ends up at the New Orleans city morgue and an autopsy reveals that it was infected with bubonic plague. The race is on to find the man's murderer to stop an epidemic. You would think this would get fairly run-of-the-mill treatment, which it sort of does, but it's Kazan's version of run-of-the-mill, which means there are all sorts of little directorial touches that prevent the film's style from feeling anonymous. Kazan had a knack for atmosphere, and the New Orleans setting really comes alive, as it would a year later for his masterpiece \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" Richard Widmark is the doctor from the health bureau whom no one will believe, and he gives a fine, tense performance. Jack Palance uses his unbelievably sharp cheekbones and jawline to good effect as Blackie, the murderer on the lam. Zero Mostel is assigned the thankless duty of playing Blackie's sap of a fall guy. And I really liked Paul Douglas in a droll performance as the New Orleans chief of police and Widmark's right-hand-man. The premise of this movie has become eerily relevant in today's climate, which actually makes it somewhat uncomfortable to watch. But it's actually got a surprising amount of humor in it too. Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays his wife, have a lot of witty banter that sounds like the way married people really talk. Credit once again goes to Kazan for creating a female character that feels like a full-bodied person and not simply a collection of \"feminine\" traits. Widmark and Douglas are funny together too, and there's a laugh-out-loud scene when Douglas is interrogating some Asian boat workers who have only the barest grasp of the English language. The obligatory chase and fight scene at the end does not feel at all staged, which is refreshing. The fist fight looks clunky and clumsy, which is how fist fights in real life are, not the nicely choreographed things we are used to seeing in Hollywood movies. The whole movie has a refreshing realism to it, so while it may not be especially profound or one that you remember for years, it will probably entertain you for a couple of hours at least and may strike you as a cut above other movies of its type. Grade: B+ Thugs get more than they bargain for; Good drama depicting how the government must cover up a killer disease which threatens a city. The carriers are a trio of hoods, each fearful or mistrustful of the other and unknowing of their plight. In a race against time and unbelieving city fathers, a medical official must try to control the dreaded plague. A great chase scene at the end creates a spine tingling finale. Low rent, but a great story; PANIC IN THE STREETS is the sort of film that could do with a modern-day remake, because the story is so fantastic and would work in any period. It tells of a dedicated detective who's hot on the trail of a criminal gang who, unbeknownst to themselves, are infected with the deadly bubonic plague virus. The detective must juggle the media - he doesn't want the story to come out due to the panic it'll cause - alongside his frightened wife and pursuit of the gang if he wants to prevent an epidemic. The only thing that works against this film is the obviously low budget, which means it lacks the finesse of, say, a Fritz Lang thriller from the period. It still does the job and ably so, with few slow spots and plenty of interest in the narrative. Richard Widmark proves a workable hero here, but he's outshone by the actors playing the criminal gang. The likes of Zero Mostel are good, but it's Jack Palance (in his debut role) who REALLY shines as the hostile gang leader. Palance is frightening, really frightening, one of those true movie psychos. PANIC IN THE STREETS incorporates plenty of suspense and even a little action into its storyline, particularly as we head towards the climax and the stakes are raised. There's a great, blackly comic set-piece involving the movement of a bedridden guy down a fire escape, plus an all-out chase at the climax which works really well. All in all this is a film noir that's well worth tracking down. They all talk like New Yorkers!; By sheer coincidence, I ended up watching a DVD of this celebrated film a few days into the tragic New Orleans flood. I expected to see a bit of local color, at the very least, and expected, too, some edge-of-the-seat suspense. (And I usually admire Elia Kazan's direction, esp. in his beautiful and moving film about the Tennessee Valley Authority, \"Wild River\" -- my favorite American love story.) I'm sorry to say that \"Panic\" struck me as hokey and dated. The various obtuse, stupid, and/or low-life characters who refuse to believe in the danger of a plague, or who for various reasons conceal it, are simply annoying; they seem like the standard Hollywood plot contrivances, designed to make us tear out our hair in frustration. The late Barbara Bel Gedes, as Richard Widmark's wife, is bland and tiresome (blame the role, not her); his little boy is as irritatingly Cute and Spunky as kids generally tend to be in movies of that day. And all the characters, including what are supposed to be native working-class Joes born in Louisiana, speak in standard film-noir New Yorkese! (Zero Mostel, disconcertingly, plays most of his scenes exactly the way he does in \"A Funny Thing Happened on the way to the Forum,\" with that same hangdog look and hands-extended/wrists-limp posture.) Sure, there's some obligatory jazz, but the film was quite a disappointment. For what it's worth, here are two personal favorites among New Orleans-based films: \"Angel Heart\" and the remake of \"Cat People.\" Great chase climaxes a `lost gem'; Refreshing `lost' gem!  Featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them.  The Douglas and Widmark characters are realistic heroes. Palance is his usual evil presence.  Widmark win the fisticuffs fight scene, a car chase of less than  seconds with a `logical' end, and a lengthy chase on foot that shames the overdone chase sequences of contemporary Hollywood.  You know how it will likely end, but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout.   The end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see.  The film seems to slow a little past the middle, but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion. Panic in the streets?  Not quite, but still a well produced and directed thriller.; This film should have been called something like Panic on the Beat or similar, because there never was any panic in the streets  it was all in the minds and action of the New Orleans city administration. Like all good films that go out of their way to promote the infallibility of authority, the good people of New Orleans were kept in the dark as various people  plagued by the plague -- wandered through the beautifully photographed dives and honky-tonks of downbeat New Orleans. This was a great movie, and I love it. With an imaginative story (one of the first  if not the first  to explore on film, in America, the effects of biological terror), a great cast and a production team headed by two of the all-time best: Elia Kazan as director (of On the Waterfront fame), and Sol C. Siegel as producer (famous for High Society, Some Came Running etc), this is a movie to watch without interruption. It won the  Oscar for Best Writing, so keep your concentration to catch some great lines between Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas  and, of course, the inimitable Zero Mostel fawning upon and wheedling with Jack Palance. The action starts rapidly, as a poker game is disrupted by a very sick player who runs off with his winnings  in fact, most of the pot. He has pneumonic plague (not bubonic, as it states in the Plot Outline) and doesn't know it. The other players, headed by Blackie (Jack Palance) supported by Raymond (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Tommy Cook) give chase and kill him, take the money, dump the body and run. So, they're all infected and don't know it  and every person they breathe on thereafter... So, when Commander Clint Reed (Richard Widmark) is called in, and he realizes the full import of the danger, the hunt is on. But, of course, he and the Police Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) don't know who they're looking for: the dead man has already been cremated on Reed's orders  too much risk of spreading the disease -- and there are no clues as to where he came from, his identity, how he got there, where he was going etc... What to do? The mayor makes the decision not to release the story to the press  too much risk of panic, and the killers will simply leave the city  so it's up to Reed and Warren to work together over the next  hours before it becomes necessary to spill the beans to the public. So, they're almost in a panic to find the carriers before that deadline. Three times, Reed just misses meeting up with Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Kazan tantalizes the viewer with both men in the same frame but unaware of the connection between them. Delicious filming that keeps you on the edge of your seat... Barbara Bel Geddes (as Reed's wife, Nancy) is almost wasted in this movie: her role is minimal at best and serves only to reinforce basic American family values. But, of course, this was the time (-) when those values were perceived to be very much under threat from the USSR and underground communism in the USA. Now, is it probable that the disease of this film is but a metaphor for the disease of communism? You can be the judge, but it matters not to me. I just turn down the lights and take in the action. So should you. \"Panic\", a modest upset at best -  with some misguided melodrama thrown in.; Elia Kazan's \"Panic In The Streets\" () is a serviceable thriller that starts off with a strong and evocative film noir style, but then degenerates into a rank detective thriller with a shotgun finish. It stars Richard Widmark as Lt. Commander Dr. Clinton Reed, a casual sort of family man who finds himself in the middle of a potential biological epidemic when an infected body washes on shore. The couple of bullet holes that in fact killed the man lead Reed to deduce that, at the very least, the murderers themselves are infected with the deadly virus. Meanwhile, back in a seedy forgotten quarter of the city, the two men responsible for the murder, Blackie (Jack Palance) and his goony henchman, Raymond Finch (Zero Mostel) are plotting their escape over the Mexican border. Blackie is the last to lose his cool, but eventually he does in atypical vintage Hollywood \"crime must pay\" style  leaving the viewer with no doubt that \"Panic In The Streets\" is just a metaphor for an impending disaster that never comes. Under the original title of \"Outbreak\" screenwriters, Edna and Edward Anhalt and Daniel Fuchs deliver a string of 'maguffins' that become tiresome before the final reel is through. There's the potential for city wide plague that never infects any more than four people; the alarmist way that Lt. Dr. Reed delivers his grave address to a suspecting city council, which disappears into quiet compliance after some initial and quickly forgotten angst; and finally; the heterosexual All-American goodie-two-shoes couple of Widmark and Barbara BelGeddes (Nancy Reed)  inexplicably inserted into the program and breaking the tense frenetic pace of the film with quiet moments involving their son. Upon its initial release, \"Panic In The Streets\" was not well received by either audiences or critics. That is has at last found a place among cinema-philes is fitting, for the film does have its artistic merits. But it does not represent either the best or even the very good of \"film noir\" as Fox's foray into developing a collection of such titles suggests. Fox's DVD presents a reasonably good looking transfer. The black and white picture elements are, on the whole, clean. Whites are generally very bright and blacks are deep and solid. Occasionally there is an excess of film dirt, grain and scratches, but these do not terribly distract. A minor amount of edge enhancement is also noticeable. The audio is mono and adequately presented. There are moments when it does sound a tad strident but this is to be expected for a film of this vintage with minimal restoration done. Extras are an audio commentary that will put one to sleep and a theatrical trailer. \"If there's a plague here, you're the most important guy in this town\"; 'Panic in the Streets ()' owes more to British noir that its American counterparts. Like Reed's 'The Third Man ()' and Dassin's 'Night and the City (),' director Elia Kazan chose to film largely on location, capturing the fresh and vibrant decadence of the New Orleans slums. In a decision borrowed from the masters of Italian neorealism, he also hired many non-professional actors for minor roles, lending an air of authenticity to the cityscape. However, any further comparisons with neorealism would be misguided, for 'Panic in the Streets' is pure melodrama, of the best kind. A murdered illegal immigrant, fished out of the bay, is found to be infected with pneumonic plague, a deadly air-borne mutation of bubonic plague, which is transmitted from human-to-human and, untreated, has a mortality rate that approaches %. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark), an officer with the U.S. Public Health Service, convinces the doubtful police-chief (Paul Douglas) to undertake a city-wide manhunt for the men responsible for the homicide, lest they also be infected with the illness. In my younger years, I found Wolfgang Petersen's 'Outbreak ()' to be among the most horrifying movies I'd ever seen. That thriller, which owes plenty to 'Panic in the Streets' {working title: \"Outbreak\"}, terrified me so efficiently because it depicted the ebola virus as both an invisible and invincible killer  how does one defend themselves against such a thing? Kazan's film is the first (that I know of) to approach the subject of biological epidemics, though it has difficulty ascribing visual recognition to an enemy that is basically undetectable to the human eye; it instead uses Jack Palance as a human personification of the Plague. Despite his venturing out among the filthy dregs of human society, you never get the sense that Clinton Reed is placing his own life at risk {some viewers have noted that Reed never inoculated himself against the plague, though I think it's safe to assume that he did so at the same time as the morgue staff}. Nevertheless, there's still a strong sense of urgency in the hunt for the infected man's killers, underground street-rats who pollute the sewers with their misdeeds. In medieval times, when the Black Death (now widely believed to have been bubonic plague) swept across the civilised world, killing a third of Europe's population, many identified the destruction as being the work of the Devil. Jack Palance's character, Blackie, serves effectively as Satan in human form: the angular-jawed thug can occasionally be charming and charismatic, but is always liable to explode into fits of violence; his two hoodlums (played by Guy Thomajan and Zero Mostel), through terror more than anything else, are constantly grovelling at his feet. When one lackey falls ill with fever, Blackie deduces that the man's immigrant cousin must have \"brought something in with him\" (the irony of his conclusion not passing unnoticed), and so attempts to ascertain what this presumably valuable object must be. He cradles the dying Poldi in his arms, a grotesque display of faux affection that is both pathetic and unsettling. Blackie/Satan is finally stopped  not by the authorities, but by the burden of his own infection/evil  as he attempts to board a cargo ship, the primary vessel by which the Plague spread across Europe. excellent drama; When plague breaks out in New Orleans, it's Richard Widmark to the rescue in \"Panic in the Streets,\" one of the lesser-celebrated films of the great Elia Kazan. Kazan keeps the pace brisk, and there are lots of marvelous touches - the scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays his wife and the scene in the police station show family life and work life and the relationships of average citizens, which is in sharp contrast to the lives and relationships of the low-lifes, portrayed by a menacing Jack Palance, his weak yes man, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook, and Louis Charles. There are also some interesting visuals - Palance has a couple of scenes with actors who seem to come up to his knees in height. The acting is marvelous and the dialogue sharp if the story isn't quite up to the direction and performances. It has a few questionable aspects which will be spotted by the viewer quite easily. That aside, it's well worth viewing. Kazan was a masterful director. Offbeat Noir; Plague replaces femme fatale in this highly suspenseful noir shot in New Orleans by director Elia Kazan. Kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes. A man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game. It turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact. City and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease. A detective and an epidemiologist up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they comb the waterfront employing their contrasting investigatory styles. Streets raises a huge ethical question about the publics right to know as the medical officer argues for a media blackout thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community. Regardless of outcome, you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the film's protagonist. Richard Widmark as Dr.Clint Reed and Paul Douglas as Detective Warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers. Barbera Bel Geddis as Reed's wife has some good moments with Widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of (restful more than comic) relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim environs of the New Orleans waterfront impressively lensed by cinematographer Joe McDonald. Zero Mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic. Walter Jack Palance as the skeletal Blackie (Black Death?) is simply outstanding. With riveting intensity Palance dominates every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well. In addition he displays a formidable athleticism that allows for a more suspenseful continuity, especially in the film's powerful final allegorical moments. Panic in the Streets is probably Kazan's best non-Brando film. It's tension filled, suspensefully well paced and edited. It's ambient on locale setting lends a sense of heightened reality that allows Kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with Panic he succeeds with aplomb. Stylish thriller by Kazan; \"Panic in the Streets\" stars Jack Palance as a violent criminal infected with a deadly airborne virus. As Jack travels throughout the New Orleans underworld, this virus spreads, infecting all whom he comes into contact with. On the case are Lt. Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the U.S. Public Health Service and New Orleans Police Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas). The virus could turn epidemic within  hours. It's imperative that they catch Palance and halt the spread of the disease. Narrative wise, the film merges police procedurals, socially conscious message movies (which were all the rage in the s) and film noirs. Aesthetically, it mixes cinema verite with German expressionism. These juxtapositions gives rise to an odd cocktail: though shot on locations, and making heavy use of New Orlean's residents for both crowd scenes and speaking roles, the film's semi-documentary style is frequently interrupted by more expressionistic flourishes (ominous shadows, creepy dwarfs etc). End result: a fast paced race against time elevated by director Elia Kazan's hybrid style. Kazan was at the top of his game during this period, so the film flows like breeze, with pacey dialogue, atmospheric locations, great camera work and excellent cinematography by Joseph MacDonald. Lighting such vast, outdoor locations (dockyards, warehouses, ports etc) whilst retaining a consistently deep focus must have been a nightmare for MacDonald. More problematic is Kazan's supposed pandering to the House Un-American Activities Committee. In this regard, his characters never cease reminding us that they're all dutifully suffering poor wages and long working houses for the Greater Good. The film even has a subplot in which a news reporter, who wears his \"Freedom of Speech\" as a badge of honour, is shut down and locked away in a jail. There are some things the public doesn't need to know, the film says, and positions us to agree with. One thus can't help but feel that \"Panic in the Streets\" is Kazan's apology for his earlier flirtations with communism; the panic (communist infestations?) in the streets is warranted, the film says, but our hardworking boys have it all under control. / - Worth one viewing. great title...; In New Orleans, Blackie (Jack Palance) and his thugs attack and kill a sick man who walked out of his game after winning his money. The coroner finds something suspicious and calls in Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark). He declares it the extremely contagious pneumonic plague. He faces opposition as he tries to raise the alarm. This is a rough and meandering thriller. The most compelling thing about the movie is the title. It's a lot of cop and robber procedural. Jack Palance is a good ruffian when he's on the screen. I like the dark gritty opening. Richard Widmark is a solid tough guy. None of the other actors are quite as striking. I don't find the investigation that compelling. It would be better if lots of people start dropping dead. The real world locations are great but the movie isn't terribly thrilling. Magnificent bad guy; This story about contagion could double as an allegory about McCarthyism. Though Elia Kazan's movie is dated and melodramatic, it has a great bad guy who gives it energy. Jack Palance's oily gang kingpin steals every scene he's in. (He seems a precursor to godfather types to follow in mobster movies decades later.) His incredibly chiseled features, athletic gangliness, and sinister demeanor are consistently riveting, particularly when he's bullying pathetic fat man Zero Mostel. The atmospherics in the movie could be better. We're in New Orleans, but you wouldn't know it most of the time. The final chase scene in a coffee warehouse helps a bit. Some other aspects of \"Panic\" didn't work for me. Much as he tried to be hard-boiled, I didn't find Paul Douglas in the role of police captain that convincing. And OK, so Richard Widmark wanted to go against type and play an idealistic doctor. I never bought it,\n",
       "especially when one of his creepy laughs escaped. His wife seemed too June Cleaverish to boot. How could she not be even a tad squeamish as a pregnant woman whose husband was pursuing the plague? The implied allegory about the spread of panic (a la McCarthyism) seems a little silly nowadays. All in all, this OK movie hasn't aged too well. Entertaining film, Jack Palance is great; A very good movie directed by the talented Elia Kazan. There were a few non-professional actors, and a bit of the script and scenes seem a little corny, even amateurish, but overall, the directing, film editing, sound, camera work, and production were great. The overall story itself was also very good, maybe just a tiny bit over the top for film noir. But the acting performances by Richard Widmark, Jack Palance, Paul Douglas, Barbara Bel Geddes, Tommy Cook, Zero Mostel, and the other professional actors were all great. Now for the real attraction. I thought Jack Palance was outstanding in this film, which was his feature film debut. Although the character he played (\"Blackie\") was a very bad (but smart) criminal, and he didn't have a lot of scenes, Palance's acting performance was fantastic. There are several scenes in this movie that are now on my all-time favorites list because of Palance's presence. I liked Palance in the \"City Slickers\" films, especially the sequel, but I never realized that he was such a talented actor in his early years. This film made me a Jack Palance fan, and I began buying early films that he was in. Panic in the Streets, some cheering in the aisles; Panic In The Streets opens in high noir style, a view along a dark street followed by a camera tilt upwards to a window, behind which is playing out a sleazy card game - an opening flourish which, along with some of the location shooting, anticipates some of the atmosphere Welles brought a decade later in Touch Of Evil. One of the players throws open the window; it's an appropriate action, serving as an introduction to the events within as well as literally opening up our first view of the underworld. Shot in high contrast black and white, Panic In The Streets benefits immensely from a strong cast as well as some fine location shooting in New Orleans. Scenes set in such places as the mortuary, the crowded shipping office or amidst the peeling paint of 'Frank's Place' offer a unique, and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere, impossible to recreate in the studio. With these elements, Kazan's film shows the influence of Dassin's groundbreaking Naked City of two years earlier, which established the gritty, almost documentary style within the noir cycle. In fact, Widmark's previous role had been in Dassin's even finer Night And The City, a film in which a sense of rising panic was even more prevalent. Joe MacDonald, a favourite with the director, photographed Panic In The Streets' detailed environment. MacDonald also worked on Kazan's Pinky and Viva Zapata!, and went on to shoot Widmark again three years later in Fuller's masterpiece Pick Up On South Street. As others have noticed, in a manner typical of some noir films, Kazan's work offers a contrast between the confusion, sickness and immorality of the streets with the modest, calm home life of the Reeds. But whereas (for instance) in Lang's The Big Heat () the home life of the hero is destroyed by elements of vice surrounding the embattled central character - ultimately sending him back to work with an increased vigilance and sense of vengeance - Panic In The Streets places Reed's rising anxiousness within the confines of what amounts to just another working 'day'. Despite all the danger, ultimately he returns back to the bosom of his family justified and satisfied. The implication being that social balance has been restored, at least for the moment by his professionalism and curative skills. That imbalance of course, has been created by crime and disease. The two are closely associated in this film. It reminds one of the tagline from the much cruder Cobra () - where \"Crime is the disease. Meet the cure,\" a neat analogy in context, if one which rings too uncomfortably of social reductionism. At its climax, as Blackie attempts to flee aboard ship, the visuals specifically allude to rats as being similar to criminals, both posing a menace to society's health. As (the presumably infected) Blackie prowls round the cheap rooms and the docks with his cronies, in search of something he suspects everyone is after, if without knowing exactly what it is, 'plague' and 'Blackie' resonate together in the audiences mind, adding further to connected associations. Ironically Blackie's hunch about Poldi's unfortunate cousin, that \"he brought something in\" of note is correct - even if, finally, its nothing he can sell or steal. Blackie's logical assumption that the police would not normally bother with the murder of some anonymous illegal immigrant has a ring of truth about it, and his so confusion is understandable. Dr Reed, although home-loving, and on the side of society, is a true noir hero. Familiar to the genre is the chief protagonist as a man who walks alone, forced to travel beyond the limits of the law. In his way, Reed is forced to take morality into his own hands for the sake of society at large - a dimension of the film that is particularly apposite, given director Kazan's controversial personal history. The director testified before the infamous HUAC, naming suspected communists and fellow travellers. His film depicts suspects being hauled in for questioning, and the manhandling of the press, on the grounds that the overriding public good justified the means. These actions perhaps echo the director's sentiments at the time, presumably accepting the McCarthyite witch hunt and the suppression of civil rights it entailed in the light of presumed communist infiltration of the entertainment industry. In these times of terrorist threats and state response, such issues as they appear in the film are strikingly modern. Standout scenes in the film include a notable scene where Blackie interrogates the dying Poldi as to the precise nature of his cousin's presumed contraband. Cat like, Blackie stalks his victim across the room, eventually preying over the doomed man's sick bed, holding Poldi's feverish head in his hands - a striking, evil cradling. It's a gesture emphasising the intimate nature of corruption, whether moral or physical. Apparently, the actors did many or all of their own stunts, which leads to some other, very dramatic scenes at the end, as the police and health authorities close in on the villains under the wharfs. Half crawling, half scrambling over the slippery timbers at the edge of the dock pool must have been an experience very uncomfortable for Palance, but it is sequence that adds immensely to the immediacy of it all. Occasionally less convincing elements distract the viewer. Apparently Dr Reed is left to fight a potential national emergency little government backup. Perhaps just as astonishingly, he never inoculates himself - inviting a dramatic turn which never materialises. At the end of the film, too, the potential epidemic has been halted, all contactees located, a little too neatly. But these weaknesses are more than outweighed by the other satisfactions of a film that still makes for compulsive and relevant viewing today. Rat race against a ravaging plague epidemic; This movie garnered an Oscar for Edna and Edward Anhalt's writing of the original story for a motion picture. And, WHAT a great idea for a story this is--even today. It was shot completely on location in what used to be a truly great and important gulf port city, New Orleans, Louisiana. This movie ingeniously teams up a crotchety, skeptical policeman (Paul Douglas) with a totally devoted doctor (Richard Widmark) from the US Public Health Service, a regular branch of the service that doesn't get enough attention for ITS service to our country. Here, we get to see Widmark as the good guy for a change. He is workaholic family man struggling to make ends meet--who doesn't have enough time for wife (Barbara Bel Geddes) and his young son. As the movie opens, we see a group of gangsters playing cards in some cheap hotel room. Blackie (Jack Palance) is the boss of the gang, Fitch (Zero Mosel) is his go-for guy, and Poldi (Guy Thomajan) is another gang member. When Poldi's cousin wants to drop out of the card game because he is sick, Blackie doesn't want him to leave since he is too far ahead in the game. When he does leave, the gang chases him though the city and down to the train tracks where he is shot and left. The police discover his body the next day and have it taken to the Coroner's office for an autopsy.... We first get to know Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) and his family in the next scene. 'Clint' and his wife, Nancy (Barbara Bel Geddes), have money problems (and bill collectors) which worry them. But, right now, Clint is trying to take some time off from work to spend it his young son who he hardly ever sees because of his job... When the coroner's autopsy reveals that the man's body is loaded with pneumonic plague---a disease related to bubonic plague but more serious since it can be so easily contracted from sneezing, sputum, or simple contact--the Coroner's office calls in Clint to handle the possible effects of a ravaging plague epidemic. Clint immediately calls for help from the NOPD. He needs them to help quickly find, and contain, the source of the plague before it spreads. Clint is teamed with a cynical Police Captain, Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who doesn't care much for doctors or Navy men. (In fact, though Clint's uniform may look like that of a Navy officer, the US Public Health Service and the Navy have nothing whatsoever to do with each other.) Tom and Clint soon learn to work together as they realize each other's roles in the almost impossible mission of finding where the dead man came from while keeping their search 'under wraps' to prevent any possible panic. Added to the difficulty of finding where the dead man came from is the fact that his body, and therefore the dead man's ID, was immediately incinerated to prevent contagion. Also, they have to work fast since the incubation period is only  hours. As Clint and Tom chase down clues, they are eventually led to a restaurant in a Greek neighborhood. They find out that the restaurant owner's wife had suddenly died of a high fever. This brings them closer to the plague's source than they had ever been; it brings them close to where Poldi in now lying sick in his mother's apartment. Poldi's mother had ordered a nurse, who had reported his symptoms to a local hospital and ordered an ambulance. On the other hand, when Blackie and Fitch find Poldi, they believe that he and his cousin had been into something with a VERY big payoff. (After allin their minds--why else wold the whole police department be looking SO hard to find Poldi and his cousin?) Blackie assumes that Poldi's cousin must have been in on a huge drug haul and Poldi must know about it. They try to pump Poldi for information before he dies. But, he is too sick to tell them anything. As Blackie and Fitch try to carry Poldi out of his mother's upstairs apartment, they meet Clint and Tom on the steps, throw Poldi down the steps, and are chased by the police. The final running foot-chase sequence, with the police in hot pursuit of Blackie and Fitch, is one of the best of it kind in film noir! The foot-chase takes us to the docks and in the warehouses and back streets of New Orleans. The two gangsters are seen on the levees, structures, and substructures of the once-famous gulf port city. The noir shots of Blackie and Fitch (Palance and Mosel) running across structures, popping up and dropping down from one level of a coffee and banana warehouse to another is almost visually poetic. In fact, they remind us of rats crawling along beams, bridges and other structures (occasionally falling in the swampy water only to get up and run some more). The rat analogy reminds us of the plague that ships sometime bring into ports and refocuses us on WHY the two are being chased in the first place: to stop and control an possible plague epidemic. After Fitch has been shot dead, the final rat-plague analogy is brought home as we see Blackie climbing a fruit freighter's line. He falls to his death, not by a bullet from the police, but by the line's rat catcher. featuring Jack g-ddamn Palance!; This was Jack Palance's debut in films as an actor (or should I say \"Walter\" Jack Palance, for some reason that's there in the credits), and he eats up every second of film he has. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and in a way it helps to lift up a character who has little dimension. He doesn't need it, you could argue: he's a thug who wants his money, that's it, and will do anything he can to get it (this may include killing, of course, which we see very early on as the thing that kicks off much of the story). He is imposing too physically, with that chiseled face and tall frame - at one point he talks to someone who is quite short and the difference between the two is like night and day - and he also is believable to the point where you realize why Zero Mostel (also very good as the talky-kinda-dumb lackey) is so subservient. Not much depth, no, but who needs depth when Palance can kick your ass any way to Sunday? In this story it's a film-noir but unique in that it's focus is not about a man-hunt only for the killer, but because of a plague (not the Bubonic plague, the other one the Numonic plague or other, the one that you just need to know is around now), and Richard Widmark plays the stalwart, headstrong doctor who will get his job done to catch the people infected (or even those, especially those, who may not be yet) into quarantine and given shots and so on. He's up against cops (including a sometimes-sympathetic-sometimes-not Paul Douglas), and a bevvy of other cops and reporters. Some of the early scenes with Widmark's family is pretty standard - he has a nice and loving and family, OK, that's fine - but once that's out of the way the story kicks in and it has a natural momentum to it. An outbreak or contagion-type of story is intrinsically dramatic because it brings people together - or, on the flip-side, it drives people apart and shows what self-interested idiots people can be some/most of the time. I don't know if Kazan meant for this to have deeper sociological meaning like On the Waterfront. Maybe the hunt for the people who've come in contact with the infected is a euphemism for Communism, or maybe not, it doesn't seem as cut and dry to me as in the latter film. In any case Panic in the Streets is engaging and enjoyable as a no-frills thriller, a picture that uses human nature and the lack of speaking up about something grave and dangerous as a way of forward momentum - who will speak up first, who won't - and if you want a simple cops and criminals chase story you get that also. I think it holds up most of all due to the performances though, even including the story, since Widmark, Panace, Mostel et al beef up the material with the kind of emotion that I'm sure Kazan was great at coaxing out of his actors (whether it was making them relaxed enough or getting them into the 'method' of it in the case of Palance I don't know). What a chase; Kazan's early film noir won an Oscar. Some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism, and rate it very highly. I can almost see where they are coming from. But I prefer to take a more toned-down approach to a long-forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi-documentary fashion. Pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to a military doctor (Widmark) and a city detective (Douglas) to apprehend the main carrier (Palance). The film is moody, shot in stark black and white, and makes very good use of locations. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Forget the symbolism (crime equals disease, and disease equals crime) and just enjoy the chase. It is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century, as it is of a particular style that was very short-lived (post WWII through the early s) and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher. For those who will be watching this for the first time, sit tight for the big chase at the end. It is something else, and frankly I don't know how they filmed some of it. I can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first  percent of the movie. Starts superbly, than opts, regrettably, for convention.; PANIC opens brilliantly with two sequences that set out its stall as a noir-melodrama: the poker game gone wrong, and the strained conversation of a doctor with his wife and son: the first is rich in metaphysical horror, the second in social and emotional power, and both are told with rare cinematic Kazan skill.  It is distressing, therefore, to see the film taking the dullest of its many options, offering an entirely predictable buddy-buddy chase-the-gangster movie, which is probably about Reds Under The Beds, but certainly isn't about excitement and invention.  There is too much talk, although you've got to see Jack Palance throwing a dying man off a stairwell in front of his mother. How similar to today's repressive and explosive situation; Think the media is full of lying prostitutes to the truth, controlled by corporate America? Then the fight between the police captain, the public health officer and the reporter will be of interest to you. Interesting counter-play between the right of the public to know the plague is loose and the attempts by Widmark and Douglass to contain the panic. Unfortunately, that also causes more deaths, since they don't get the co-operation they would have had if they had told some of the people, and a woman dies. A Little irrational, since many people were waylaid by the plague-carrying human rats and you don't get the feeling they were all inoculated, but it was definitely well-staged. New Orleans has never looked seedier. Jack Palance has never looked more menacing, and Widmark was a nice guy, for a change. The acting is top notch, and Kazan, not my favorite human being because of his own 'rat-like' qualities, naming names before the witch hunting McCarthy Commission, did a good job of directing. Too bad he ruined the careers of so many good actors, Zero Mostel included (and this was his last picture for many years because of it). Check this one out. The DVD has a lot of interesting information. Another prime Cold War thriller; With the Cold War kicking into gear, this movie  in a way, like the Body Snatchers movies that followed it  focuses on the chaos of panic, here brought about by a deadly disease, a plague. Tense and at times terrifying, Panic in the Streets is electric gold as far as the genre is concerned. It's tightly written, although viewed through the glass of  a little simplistic at times (see below), and expertly acted. It all starts when a man is smuggled onto a boat that docks in New Orleans. The man then visits a poker game with his cousin and winds up winning a lot of money from a gangster named Blackie (Jack Palance, in his debut). When the man, rather than risk his winnings to give Blackie a chance to win them back, takes off, he's cornered by Blackie and his henchmen, then shot to death and dragged into the river, where he's discovered the next morning. But when the coroner examines the body, he finds something suspicious. Yes, a bullet ended the man's life, but he was already dying. Enter Health Inspector Clint Reed (Richard Widmark), who immediately recognizes the disease as pneumonic plague, which  and I don't know this to be scientific fact  is extremely contagious. Reed must find the man's cousin, the Patient Zero, before he can unwittingly pass the illness  which is fatal  along to the rest of the city, even the world. He's teamed up with crusty police chief Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who's not sure the doctor's right but is smart enough to follow orders anyway, however reluctantly. It doesn't take long for him to be convinced that there is cause for panic and that the city as a whole must be quietly quarantined, if plausible. The chemistry between Douglas and Widmark drives the script. Palance is a terrific menace, as he would go on to be in countless movies. Zero Mostel is on hand as one of his henchmen; Barbara Bel Geddes plays Reed's wife. The men are in a race against time, figuring they have less than  hours to find their Patient Zero. Warren's police work and Douglas' medical knowledge help them retrace the smuggled man's footsteps and those of the newly infected as well. If I'm going to gripe about anything, it's the ease with which Reed eradicates the disease. What's that, you say? You may have encountered the sick man? Here, we'll inoculate you, all better. Not sure that's how inoculation works, really, but I'll suspend disbelief for this movie on the grounds that it was a lot of fun to watch. Very well done.; Intense, gripping drama / thriller from director Elia Kazan, set in New Orleans. A gang of lowlife criminals murder one of their own, not knowing the man was carrying pneumonic plague. A stubborn public health doctor, Clinton Reed (the excellent Richard Widmark, playing a somewhat flawed yet still likable hero) figures things out and does his damnedest to try to prevent the disease from spreading, with the sometimes reluctant help of police captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas). The movie does have an appropriate amount of atmosphere in some of its scenes, particularly in the opening, but for the most part actually takes place in the day time, and truthfully isn't in a typical film noir type of mode. Kazan, however, would strive for realism at all times, casting many locals to basically play themselves. He does allow the pace to slow at times, giving Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes a crucial character driven scene that both lets the actors show off their chops and effectively humanize their characters. But the story does have a fine forward momentum nevertheless, leading to a climactic chase scene. Concocted by Edward and Edna Anhalt (adapted by Daniel Fuchs, and scripted by Richard Murphy), who won an Oscar for it, it serves as a potent forerunner of more recent movies such as \"Outbreak\" (In fact, the working title of this movie *was* \"Outbreak\"!). It gets a lot of effectiveness from its often antagonistic interplay between its actors, especially leads Widmark and Douglas, as well as the pivotal casting of soon-to-be legend (Walter) Jack Palance, in his first major screen role; he makes for a wonderful heavy (naturally), with an amazing physical presence and that instantly recognizable visage. Zero Mostel is quite a hoot as his more nebbish-y accomplice; other performers such as Lewis Charles (as the doomed man at the beginning), Emile Meyer as the hostile Nile Queen captain (with him, Palance, and Douglas on hand, \"Panic in the Streets\" doesn't lack for real tough guys in its cast), and Guy Thomajan as the flunky Poldi also do quite well; Tommy Rettig of 'Lassie' fame plays Reed's son and director Kazan can be seen as Cleaver, the mortuary assistant. Overall, a highly enjoyable and stylish movie, with Kazan going more for long shots than close ups, that entertains sharply from beginning to end. Eight out of . Highly Recommended; Many years ago, I saw Panic in the Streets on the late movie and it introduced me to what was to become one of my favorite sub-genres of movies, documentaries and non-fiction books:  the pursuit of deadly disease. Richard Widmark stars as a doctor in the US Public Health Service chasing down a killer (excellently played by Jack Palance) who is  carrying pneumonic plague, the deadlier airborne version of bubonic plague.  Widmark and Paul Douglas, as a New Orleans cop, have only  hours to stop the killer and everyone he meets before the plague becomes epidemic in the crowded, impoverished streets of New Orleans. Panic in the Streets was directed by Elia Kazan just before he did A Streetcar Named Desire.  Although by no means as brilliant as Streetcar or his later On the Waterfront, Panic is an excellent movie on many levels.  It works well as a noir thriller, but equally well as a warning of the dangers epidemic disease long before anyone ever heard of ebola, anthrax or west Nile.  Kazan himself, thought of Panic as his first \"real\" movie, despite the fact that he had already made Pinky and Gentleman's Agreement. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes Elia Kazan, or noir, or a first class medical thriller. Great Cast; Panic in the Streets () *** (out of ) Tense thriller about a doctor (Richard Widmark) and cop (Paul Douglas) who are trying to track down a gang of thugs who might just be carrying a pneumonia plague. The men have -hours to try and locate those with the plague or face the danger of it spreading throughout the country. Outside a few logical flaws, this is an extremely well-made and wonderfully acted thriller that manages to capture some great action as well as a lot of nice undertones. I think what I enjoyed most here was the frustration that kept growing for the doctor and cop simply because everyone refused to help them out. I liked how the dark side of New Orleans is shown and how the entire problem could have been over in the matter of minutes had someone simply opened their mouths and said what they knew. I think this was one of the best aspects of the film as the men had to constantly plead their case and the doctor was constantly trying to convince people that the plague was real and that he wasn't just blowing things up. I wouldn't call this a film noir like it's been labeled but as a thriller we get some great drama with the threat of the virus spreading but the film also works well as a crime picture due in large part to Jack Palance, in his film debut, playing the thug who refuses to get caught. Palance, with that dark black hair and outfit, is perfect in the role of the criminal and you have no problem believing that people would really fear him. Palance comes off incredibly menacing and just as threatening as the plague itself. Widmark and Douglas were two masters at playing fast-talking and tough characters and seeing them together just doubles all the fun. I really enjoyed how both men played their own style of toughness yet they worked so incredibly well together that you would just love to see other movies based around these characters. Both actors have no problems getting into their roles and deliver extremely strong work. Zero Mostel is wonderful as well as another one of the thugs and Barbara Bel Geddes gets to shine in her few scenes as Widmark's wife. I think there are a few logical issues like the entire thing being kept so quiet. I seriously doubt outside agencies wouldn't have been called in if there really was a threat of this thing spreading across the country. The real plague would have also been a lot uglier than what's shown here but it's understandable that they'd cut back just because of the time this was released. Kazan's direction is top-notch throughout as is the terrific music score. The cinematography is pretty much a character of its own as we get some wonderful shots including one sequence where the original sick man is stumbling through the streets with the other thugs following him.   \n",

       "      <td>Only for the kids!; This movie is definitely not for adults. I'd say that childen between the ages of - could enjoy \"Bäst i Sverige\", but not older. The manuscript was terrible, the acting average and the movie was in no way realistic. My rating: / Incredible combination of realistic and fantastic ingredients; One of the best movies for kids I`ve ever seen. Children - mine included - like it a lot, and that`s most important for a kid`s film. The Children`s Jury at the Stuttgart Film Festival  voted it \"Best Children`s Film\" at the festival. Two kids - about  years old - Marcello and Fatima, meet and like each other very much. Both have dreams and problems. Marcello wants to fly but feels like an absolutely useless human being, Fatima wants to play soccer - which is not acceptable for her muslim family. But then they start to support each other in a very delicate and subtle manner... The film combines realistic moments and problems with dreams and imagination, especially Marcello`s. I.e. there is a statue of Jesus Christ waking up and talking to him in a humoristic way. Grown-ups will maybe have some problems with that, but children like the fact, that the world consists of both - reality and their imagination. Children and their way seeing the world are taken seriously in this film, which is very rare in feature films for children! Very good for Children aged ca.  - .</td>\n",

       "      <td>By far the best movie concerning marriage in modern times; This is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple. The movie portrais a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion, infidelity, juggling work and family. The so called \"culture of death\" that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think. A must see. I hope it gets distributed as it should. Congratulations on the cast and director. Two thumbs up and a  star evaluation from me! A \"Milanese\" case..., are you really like this??; I was very pleased to go and see a \"Milanese\" film shot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who has understood properly and fortunately printed in a film the Milanese philosophy. Film tells the story of a standard -in career- Milanese couple, starting from \"the birth\" to the death. The birth-wedding is so typical out of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love. Life is hard in the \"urbe\" of Milan and after the sweeties old days became tougher and tougher, then finally the product: a child, who instead of strengthen further the couple relationship it weaken because \"the selfish effect\" typical of a nowadays \"metropolis\" personality. The advertising environment with all the \"creative\" under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot.  We are losing the life values and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp movie from the Senza Pelle's director. The actors are well chosen, Stefania Rocca nice and well characterised, and a positive surprise, an unexpected good Fabio Volo, well known by the \"trash\" TV serie: Le Iene. Rating: / Watching it!; I am right now in front of the tv, watching Casomai. It is changing, it id evolving or better...devolving. It begin with a courius wedding of the two protagonists where their love-story is reported. After that everything change, a child was born, and all the rest usually happen in a couple. It is a not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple, and normality is the center of this movie. It doesn't want to show us something particular, there is nothing new, it is just a normal love-story, the story of a couple, and being normal it become different from the rest. It is also a flashing movie, everything is short, every scene is long just some seconds. It is a reported story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about that, and their opinion is central, the opinions create the story and destroy it. It is a simple story of a couple as I said, but it is not boring, it just show a couple, should be everything known, it is, but I am sure that every one of you will want to know what happen, so don't forget to watch the end! Ever wondered what it means to be married?; \"Casomai\" is a masterful tale depicting the story of a young couple who wade through the murky waters of marriage. The story is very believable in telling the strange see-saw between oblivion and continuous interference by others, which is fairly typical in Italy (one may wonder whether such happenings are different elsewhere, though). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good at writing, and that is one of the strong points of the movie. Acting by Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo is sober and gripping. And the figure of the sympathetic priest is funny and well-rounded. All in all, a truly deserving movie, probably one of the best Italian movies of the year. So what?; (Spoilers) I was very curious to see this film, after having heard that it was clever and witty. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt. The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves, through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience. What made me dislike the whole film were two things. First of all, the film was so down-to-earth that it looked as if, by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day-to-day basis, it became itself ordinary and dull. Secondly, the overall sloppiness of the production, with dialogues that were barely understandable. Too bad. A wonderful movie, so simple yet so strong; I loved this movie and I happened to watch it twice in  months, in . I already liked Stefania Rocca, but I didn't think Fabio Volo would have been a great actor (telling from his previous TV shows). Instead he was. And so was the priest. The soft simplicity with which the movies explores a whole love story, starting from the beginning, growing to the climax and then facing ever-increasing difficulties, to reach the final break... was really special. Some moments are really enjoyable, and some other moments will make you cry, as you are pulled, along with the  wed characters, into deep troubles, feeling love that vanishes minute after minute and, actually, without really knowing \"why\" they're not in love anymore. I'd say  stars out of , even if I may understand that, to non-italian people, it may loose some of its beauty. It takes a village to make a marriage endure.; A sophisticated contemporary fable about the stresses that work to loosen and ultimately unbind the vows of marriage. The main thrust of the narrative arises from a 'homily' spoken by a country priest following the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from Milan. In it, the future course of the marriage is spelled out, which bit by bit frays from the stresses of modern life. The 'moral' of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out, both now, and in the past, it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends. This film was a relative blockbuster by domestic Italian standards. It's a terrible shame that this film is not available in either DVD or VHS. Who likes contract marriage? Nobody, after the priest tells their own history\n",
       "; The best film about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflections to the couples that will be come to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family. This decision could be the better or the worst in our lives and the life of our kids. The real intrusion or help of 'friends' -or executioner if we leave-. The real role of families: they can help or they can destroy us. The mad priest who possibly is not much mad telling what could happen according the statistics and the reality. A couple who thinks in a 'special' marriage, live a painful story in their future own history. Who likes contract marriage? Nobody, after the priest tells their own history\n",
       " if they leave the future in another hands, if they don't know WHAT is the marriage. That the problems are true, that the life demand a real engage, guaranties, from each one. That the real victims of the divorce are kids, with real name Andrea in the film- or names. That the abortion is only an easy exit: sadness, regrets and unhappiness will be there after abortion. That the state and social security thinks every time less in a real problems of the families. The gossip of the 'friends', the infidelity because of weakness and desperation of Steffania because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone. Maybe someone could think that this film is a pessimistic film, but not. Steffania and Tomasso, in the deep of their hearts, they like a beautiful marriage and family, if not, Why they like marriage? A truly and beautiful marriage depends only of the couple: of each one of their decisions, of each one actions in their lives. The family could be a place where each one feel loved because being his or her, only by existing. The screenplay is wonderful. The performances are great: Steffania and Tomasso, ¡the almost cynical priest! An excellent direction and script. The colors and the management of the cameras, superb. my first and last movie, before and after getting married; \"CASOMAI\" was the last movie I've seen before getting married, just last year. It was also the first movie I've searched for, after I was married, because we promised to offer a copy to our priest. Sometimes, reality is not that apart from fiction. To all those who wrote that priests like \"Don Camillo\" don't exist in real life, I would recommend them to visit my Priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) To all others, I would only recommend them to see this movie, before and after the \"I do!\" day :-) Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal A Cinema Masterpiece; I now that these days, some people wan't see a movie without movie styling, so much Dogma, Lars Von, Watchosky Brothers, are changed what we expect in a movie, perhaps, Casomai is no-one-more-Independent-non-american movie, the movie take all movies resources and language to tell us a simple history about love and marriage, but much more .. Fully of views, lectures and let you thinking ... and I'm sure, you can't fell boried any second of a long  minutes. I calculate that don't have a single scene longer that  o  / minutes. Is just for two, right?; This movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts, I love the final, when nobody knows what are they gonna do about their life, but it's completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right, is jut for two, so what are the other persons doing there? The movie embrace you to a new life, to experiences, to be able of dream with the other person and reach those dreams. Also shows you the life itself, hard like it is. But gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need. Hope this comment works for you. The movie it did worked well for me. I bought the movie by the way ;) Take care. I never met a priest like that; Casomai opens with a young couple driving to a chapel somewhere in the hills to arrange to be married there. They meet the priest, who steals every scene he is in, and the ceremony is arranged. At the ceremony, the priest draws out of the couple and their friends and families their stories, told in flashbacks and flashforwards. We see the course of the couple's relationship through newly-married times, the birth of their first child, and onwards. Will the marriage survive the pressures of friends and family, of work, of child-care, of financial worries, and of cooling passion? The movie starts promisingly, with the priest being the most interesting character. But once the movie concentrates on the couple, I found my interest and sympathy waning as their relationship became more unhappy. The movie might appeal if you delight in sharing other people's problems, but after about an hour I found myself wondering how much more I had to endure. I found the ending quite weak. I gave the movie  out of --neutral--the clever parts offsetting the flat parts.</td>\n",

                          Only for the kids!; This movie is definitely not for adults. I'd say that childen between the ages of - could enjoy \"Bäst i Sverige\", but not older. The manuscript was terrible, the acting average and the movie was in no way realistic. My rating: / Incredible combination of realistic and fantastic ingredients; One of the best movies for kids I`ve ever seen. Children - mine included - like it a lot, and that`s most important for a kid`s film. The Children`s Jury at the Stuttgart Film Festival  voted it \"Best Children`s Film\" at the festival. Two kids - about  years old - Marcello and Fatima, meet and like each other very much. Both have dreams and problems. Marcello wants to fly but feels like an absolutely useless human being, Fatima wants to play soccer - which is not acceptable for her muslim family. But then they start to support each other in a very delicate and subtle manner... The film combines realistic moments and problems with dreams and imagination, especially Marcello`s. I.e. there is a statue of Jesus Christ waking up and talking to him in a humoristic way. Grown-ups will maybe have some problems with that, but children like the fact, that the world consists of both - reality and their imagination. Children and their way seeing the world are taken seriously in this film, which is very rare in feature films for children! Very good for Children aged ca.  - .   \n",
       "3853  By far the best movie concerning marriage in modern times; This is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple. The movie portrais a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion, infidelity, juggling work and family. The so called \"culture of death\" that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think. A must see. I hope it gets distributed as it should. Congratulations on the cast and director. Two thumbs up and a  star evaluation from me! A \"Milanese\" case..., are you really like this??; I was very pleased to go and see a \"Milanese\" film shot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who has understood properly and fortunately printed in a film the Milanese philosophy. Film tells the story of a standard -in career- Milanese couple, starting from \"the birth\" to the death. The birth-wedding is so typical out of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love. Life is hard in the \"urbe\" of Milan and after the sweeties old days became tougher and tougher, then finally the product: a child, who instead of strengthen further the couple relationship it weaken because \"the selfish effect\" typical of a nowadays \"metropolis\" personality. The advertising environment with all the \"creative\" under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot.  We are losing the life values and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp movie from the Senza Pelle's director. The actors are well chosen, Stefania Rocca nice and well characterised, and a positive surprise, an unexpected good Fabio Volo, well known by the \"trash\" TV serie: Le Iene. Rating: / Watching it!; I am right now in front of the tv, watching Casomai. It is changing, it id evolving or better...devolving. It begin with a courius wedding of the two protagonists where their love-story is reported. After that everything change, a child was born, and all the rest usually happen in a couple. It is a not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple, and normality is the center of this movie. It doesn't want to show us something particular, there is nothing new, it is just a normal love-story, the story of a couple, and being normal it become different from the rest. It is also a flashing movie, everything is short, every scene is long just some seconds. It is a reported story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about that, and their opinion is central, the opinions create the story and destroy it. It is a simple story of a couple as I said, but it is not boring, it just show a couple, should be everything known, it is, but I am sure that every one of you will want to know what happen, so don't forget to watch the end! Ever wondered what it means to be married?; \"Casomai\" is a masterful tale depicting the story of a young couple who wade through the murky waters of marriage. The story is very believable in telling the strange see-saw between oblivion and continuous interference by others, which is fairly typical in Italy (one may wonder whether such happenings are different elsewhere, though). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good at writing, and that is one of the strong points of the movie. Acting by Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo is sober and gripping. And the figure of the sympathetic priest is funny and well-rounded. All in all, a truly deserving movie, probably one of the best Italian movies of the year. So what?; (Spoilers) I was very curious to see this film, after having heard that it was clever and witty. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt. The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves, through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience. What made me dislike the whole film were two things. First of all, the film was so down-to-earth that it looked as if, by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day-to-day basis, it became itself ordinary and dull. Secondly, the overall sloppiness of the production, with dialogues that were barely understandable. Too bad. A wonderful movie, so simple yet so strong; I loved this movie and I happened to watch it twice in  months, in . I already liked Stefania Rocca, but I didn't think Fabio Volo would have been a great actor (telling from his previous TV shows). Instead he was. And so was the priest. The soft simplicity with which the movies explores a whole love story, starting from the beginning, growing to the climax and then facing ever-increasing difficulties, to reach the final break... was really special. Some moments are really enjoyable, and some other moments will make you cry, as you are pulled, along with the  wed characters, into deep troubles, feeling love that vanishes minute after minute and, actually, without really knowing \"why\" they're not in love anymore. I'd say  stars out of , even if I may understand that, to non-italian people, it may loose some of its beauty. It takes a village to make a marriage endure.; A sophisticated contemporary fable about the stresses that work to loosen and ultimately unbind the vows of marriage. The main thrust of the narrative arises from a 'homily' spoken by a country priest following the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from Milan. In it, the future course of the marriage is spelled out, which bit by bit frays from the stresses of modern life. The 'moral' of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out, both now, and in the past, it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends. This film was a relative blockbuster by domestic Italian standards. It's a terrible shame that this film is not available in either DVD or VHS. Who likes contract marriage? Nobody, after the priest tells their own history\n",
       "; The best film about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflections to the couples that will be come to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family. This decision could be the better or the worst in our lives and the life of our kids. The real intrusion or help of 'friends' -or executioner if we leave-. The real role of families: they can help or they can destroy us. The mad priest who possibly is not much mad telling what could happen according the statistics and the reality. A couple who thinks in a 'special' marriage, live a painful story in their future own history. Who likes contract marriage? Nobody, after the priest tells their own history\n",
       " if they leave the future in another hands, if they don't know WHAT is the marriage. That the problems are true, that the life demand a real engage, guaranties, from each one. That the real victims of the divorce are kids, with real name Andrea in the film- or names. That the abortion is only an easy exit: sadness, regrets and unhappiness will be there after abortion. That the state and social security thinks every time less in a real problems of the families. The gossip of the 'friends', the infidelity because of weakness and desperation of Steffania because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone. Maybe someone could think that this film is a pessimistic film, but not. Steffania and Tomasso, in the deep of their hearts, they like a beautiful marriage and family, if not, Why they like marriage? A truly and beautiful marriage depends only of the couple: of each one of their decisions, of each one actions in their lives. The family could be a place where each one feel loved because being his or her, only by existing. The screenplay is wonderful. The performances are great: Steffania and Tomasso, ¡the almost cynical priest! An excellent direction and script. The colors and the management of the cameras, superb. my first and last movie, before and after getting married; \"CASOMAI\" was the last movie I've seen before getting married, just last year. It was also the first movie I've searched for, after I was married, because we promised to offer a copy to our priest. Sometimes, reality is not that apart from fiction. To all those who wrote that priests like \"Don Camillo\" don't exist in real life, I would recommend them to visit my Priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) To all others, I would only recommend them to see this movie, before and after the \"I do!\" day :-) Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal A Cinema Masterpiece; I now that these days, some people wan't see a movie without movie styling, so much Dogma, Lars Von, Watchosky Brothers, are changed what we expect in a movie, perhaps, Casomai is no-one-more-Independent-non-american movie, the movie take all movies resources and language to tell us a simple history about love and marriage, but much more .. Fully of views, lectures and let you thinking ... and I'm sure, you can't fell boried any second of a long  minutes. I calculate that don't have a single scene longer that  o  / minutes. Is just for two, right?; This movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts, I love the final, when nobody knows what are they gonna do about their life, but it's completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right, is jut for two, so what are the other persons doing there? The movie embrace you to a new life, to experiences, to be able of dream with the other person and reach those dreams. Also shows you the life itself, hard like it is. But gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need. Hope this comment works for you. The movie it did worked well for me. I bought the movie by the way ;) Take care. I never met a priest like that; Casomai opens with a young couple driving to a chapel somewhere in the hills to arrange to be married there. They meet the priest, who steals every scene he is in, and the ceremony is arranged. At the ceremony, the priest draws out of the couple and their friends and families their stories, told in flashbacks and flashforwards. We see the course of the couple's relationship through newly-married times, the birth of their first child, and onwards. Will the marriage survive the pressures of friends and family, of work, of child-care, of financial worries, and of cooling passion? The movie starts promisingly, with the priest being the most interesting character. But once the movie concentrates on the couple, I found my interest and sympathy waning as their relationship became more unhappy. The movie might appeal if you delight in sharing other people's problems, but after about an hour I found myself wondering how much more I had to endure. I found the ending quite weak. I gave the movie  out of --neutral--the clever parts offsetting the flat parts.   \n",

       "      <td>A good dramedy.; This is actually a nine or eight star film if you are open to it. The critics have lost their capacity to enjoy films, much like the Fanning character in the movie. But, for them, sadly, there is no redemption. Fanning is brilliant, every time she opens her mouth she touches your heart. Murphy is very good, and as one IMDb user has written, \"adults probably wrote it off as a 'kids movie' and the kids didn't understand the emotional plot line\"....interesting explanation as to why the film did only  million domestically. Who is the audience for this film? What age? Women, from fourteen to thirty, probably. The only fault I can think of is it moves too fast to get to the story, and a few more nuances would have made it a little more palpable. I liked this film. Even if it goes nice at the second hour of it, its first hour blows everything.; ** out of **** Uptown Girls is a movie which shows us two persons, one is a woman who acts entirely as a child and the other one is a child who acts entirely like a grown up person, or as the movie may suggest: a woman. Unfortunately it seems that it doesn't work that way. The \"woman\", played by Brittany Murphy doesn't do anything in the movie that may be classified as a job. At least, in the beginning of it. But when she can't afford to stay in her apartment building anymore, she's kicked out and now must find a job. Murphy's character to begin is horrible! She actually doesn't need to speak any lines in order for the movie to play childish soundtrack for her, she only needs to show up on screen. And when she speaks, the movie plays stupid songs, which fit in a way, we may say: what a stupid comedy movie, it almost seems like a TV movie... She must find a job to save her life and that leads her to become a babysitter of the child who she met in her own birthday party. This child is Dakota Fanning's character. For her, I have only four words: good performance, bad role. The real problem with Fanning is that she performs great, but her character sucks! It's a character we immediately skip any possible chance of getting sympathy. She's just too serious, acts like a grown up person, listening to Mozart (can you believe it?), skipping fun, talking in a harsh way to her babysitter and the list goes on forever. Just watch the movie and you'll understand. Fanning would be much more interesting in other roles, specially in villain roles. She could play the daughter of a witch in a horror movie the way she plays in Uptwon Girls, who knows? There are other things in the plot including a handsome boy that Murphy falls in love with, Fanning's bale scenes and the need of Murphy to get rid of her father's guitars. Now that was the problem of Uptown Girls with the characters. It's sad that the only two special characters of the movie are the only ones who screw it. But the real problem with this movie is its first hour. It's not even a comedy movie, it's pure childish, stupid and irritating. Just when Fanning starts to inspire sympathy to her father is when the movie starts to get interesting because we see scenes of Murphy and Fanning interacting with each other much greater than before, as wee see them for the first time trying to get real adults conversations. Unfortunately that's only the second hour of the movie. As for my mother who watched the movie with me, she said: this \"water with sugar\" actually didn't end so bad. Sadly, maybe Uptown Girls might have needed some more sugar. Or even, the sands of time from Prince Of Persia to turn back time and do what must be done: make Murphy grown up and Fanning grown down! I enjoyed it; I just had an Uncle's day out with four of my nieces.  After lunch we saw this movie.  Much to my chagrin this is the movie the girls picked. Wow -- I was pleasantly surprised.  It had a few rough areas that others have commented on but overall an enjoyable movie. Yikes -- have I really said this? Really Great.....; This is a really great movie. It could be a little sappy at times but is a feel good chick flick that I saw in the theater....with no regrets. Brittany Murphy does an excellent job of playing Molly....a girl who all her life got everything she wanted after her rockstar parents died and she got everything....when there is a problem with the money Molly must resort to *dare she think it* get a job. She gets a job as a nanny for a little girl that has way to much on her mind for her age. With the little girl's father being very very sick and her work-a-holic mother, she can't trust anything. Molly tries to change that. Dakota Fanning does a great job for a young actress. She is a real talent. All and all I thought this movie was really good and have even considered buying it. I give it  out of  stars.....try watching it! worth a look! enjoy! There is magic...; Indeed, in this movie we learn that magic is real, that the power to bring a smile on someone's face is in our hands, it lays within us, in our beliefs. What I loved about this movie is (well, I also fell in love with Mu, the pig) the resemblance with reality. As kids we usually act grown-up, we really lung to get to adulthood and when we're there we're lost in our own wish and don't know how to act anymore. What we can learn from this movie is to act accordingly to our age, to stop wasting our childhood with grown-up attitudes, to understand that smiling, laughing and playing are normal and desirable for that age. And as adults, I guess we can keep some of the childhood features. With so much grief around us, I don't see why we shouldn't be the ones to make the others smile. Watch the movie, you've got only to gain from it. this movie sucked; This is the worst movie ive ever seen.  I have not seen Gigli, but i imagine it cant be worst, but people tell me that it is, and i dont know how that is possible. My favorite part was the end. i mean the credits not the stupid guitar dance. that was the stupidest part. Moo was the best character. he was the only one who didn't talk. Boaz Yakin  is my cup of tea; Boaz Yakin is someone I've been following since he wrote and directed 's FRESH, which is one of the best films I've ever seen. None of his subsequent projects have had the power of that movie but I'm an unbelievably loyal Leo, and I will keep seeing anything the man writes and/or directs. This one, Uptown Girls, is directed by Yakin, and it does display his knack for getting decent interaction from his performers; there are some extremely believable scenes between Murphy and Fanning, in particular, who both manage, under his direction and thanks to their innate talent (especially the soon-to-be-legendary Fanning's), to breathe genuine life into their potentially one-dimensional characters. I hadn't read anything about the movie beforehand, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it play out not as a farce but rather as a skewed and quirky buddy movie, with both characters learning from each other what it means to be human, at any age. Good use of subordinate characters as well, and although the film is hardly a masterpiece by any stretch, it most definitely has its heart in the right place. It is a girly film but don't let that distract you!; Well as a bloke with a strong feminine streak (somewhere!) inside, I have to say that I sat down this afternoon and watched this movie with my girlfriend and ended up laughing and crying with her. OK the first  mins take there toll but it does pick up in a warm and snuggly way that identifies with anyone who has loved and lost. I am not saying that this film is perfect or brilliant, just that it is a good story, well acted and delivered and worthy of an evening or afternoon cuddling with your other half and enjoying it for all it is. A girly film which delivers exactly what is on the box, and if one wishes to nit pick, one can, but why bother? Enjoy it for what it is. Matcho guys need not apply, nor watch, cos there is bog all that will turn your nuts! Nuff said ! **** out of  (and this is from a bloke who HAS loved and lost!)  Ehh...; When I went to see Uptown Girls, I had high expectations and they weren't really fulfilled. Molly is  a spoiled brat who basically gets whatever she wants, and what she wants is the cute new guy (Jesse Spencer) she meets. However, she doesn't have the time or money to keep their relationship up after her vault runs dry and must become the nanny to stuck-up, stiff Ray (Dakota Fanning). I am usually a chick-flick person, but this was forgettable and the plot was very thin and kept changing directions. It was entertaining and had its funny moments, but it looked a lot better in the trailers (doesn't it always?). The acting was good, for the most part, and I think Dakota Fanning is great, but I just don't think I'd be able to sit through this movie again. It felt unresolved at the end, even though it seemed like someone was yelling \"The solution is that there is no solution\". Overall, it was OK, but not worth the nine bucks I was charged. A modern fable bundled up in an ethereal dream.; This movie was wonderful! A hypnotic modern fairy tale, it recounts the story of a beautiful princess and her charmed life in her New York City penthouse... and the blow-by-blow destruction of the delusions that kept up that sheltered existence. Brittany Murphy succeeds as the enchanted, ethereal Molly... in a swirling, twirling, whimsical performance that evokes the images of Jean Cocteau's Elise from Les Enfants Terribles. Once in awhile in life we run into people who frustrate us because of their chronic inability to set their two feet down and stand tall, and in that respect I could understand how Molly's character wouldn't be engaging to all audiences. However, for many who have known Mollys or who are like Molly, innocent and unspoiled purity thrust into a fiercely insensitive world, Molly's character evokes good-natured sympathy. One remarkable thing of the film is that Molly, though portrayed through the reactions she gets from the people who surround her, is clearly spoiled, and yet the audience would have to rely on its own gut reaction to spoiled children, because the director gives a merciful and empathetic eye to Molly (who most of us will not be able to dislike no matter how much her deludedness disgusts us!)... from Molly's point of view, she is just a bright and wide-eyed child observing the world from a lens of imaginative affluence. It is hardly her fault she comes from a background of wealth, and lives extravagently... yet we do not get a sense that the wealth is the most important thing for her... she just wants to live the best she can in her own circumstances... which we see proved as she slowly adjusts to the bourgeoius lifestyle she must adapt to that provides the plot of the film. Molly gains strength and makes many decisions that reflect her integrity, and while a part of her will remain in the dappled candlelit world of sensuality and abandon... she can dwell in the fast-paced reality of the working world with a resolve almost as ferocious as her love for beauty. The onset of the film may provide cynics with satisfaction at the progressive deconstruction of Molly's delirious existence... but cynics will have a sour taste in their mouth as they watch Molly grow, and almost root against her evolution... because a girl who has had everything handed to her succeeds at growing up while remaining who she is at the core. We can all get a little jealous of those whose lives are so charmed, the ones destined for greatness while so many of us toil and labor for most of our lives to recieve just half of the self-realization and fulfillment Molly experiences. But after all, it is not comparing our challenging lives to the seemingly easier  lives of others' that should motivate us to be ambitious, it is the satisfaction of our own hard work and the willingness to do it... as we learn from Molly. This film has told my story. Poignant and made with integrity, it is not a simple comedy. In fact, the way the film conveys romantic relationships is done with a sense of realism. The characters are definitely substantial and realistic... just because you've never met people like them doesn't mean that there isn't an abundance of deludanoids populating the penthouses of the Upper West Side, or the palaces of California. Brittany Murphy has struck gold again. A refreshing follow up to the somewhat lackluster Just Married, or the downright creepy (but engaging!) Spun. **/ stars out of ; Brittney Murphy and Dakota Fanning star as a very childish -year old and a very mature -year old in a movie that is pretty flawless. That is if you're a pre-teen and a girl. Everything from the heavy use of peppy teen music, to the shiny lights and purples and pinks decorating the sets and wardrobe to Brittney herself create a mood characteristic of a modern Cinderella story. For the rest of us, it might not be your cup of tea depending on how far removed you are from  and your gender, but it still has its moments. Brittney proves herself capable of creating movie magic on screen showing us her childish side, even if she overdoes it a little. As for her counterpart, Fanning holds up ok except that the writers didn't create a very convincing -year old. On the whole, the movie is rather intelligent and deals with some weighty material (death of a parent, neglect, etc) that is quite powerful. A lot better than you've heard; I'm really surprised by the nasty reviews I've read for this movie. I thought it was one of the better movies I've seen lately. One thing though. I think it's more of a drama than a comedy so the ads may be a little misleading, (spoilers) This story is about two young women who aren't really as different as you might think. They both are the product of a privileged music industry upbringing but have reacted to it in a completely different ways. Molly goes with it and becomes the gypsy/groupie type and Ray rebels by becoming an ultra uptight Ms. Perfect. They're brought together by mutual crisis, no nanny can deal with Ray and Molly desperately needs a job. Naturally there is friction between the two but they both realize that they need each other for more than one reason. Throughout the film Molly learns responsibility by mothering Ray who really hasn't had any nurturing to speak of. By having someone to take care of her, Ray is allowed to let her guard down and be a kid. There are bumps along the way because that's how life is. But they come through it together and I think the tea cup scene at the end is a great moment of transition and healing for both characters. By helping Ray deal with her current trauma (the death of her father), Molly is able to deal with her past trauma (the death of her parents). There is such a connection there between the two actresses, it's just beautiful really. Some people may think it's hokey, but I think it's very true to life. In essence this is a heartwarming story about two people who desperately need a fairy godmother. And  they become that for each other. It's sweet, maybe too sweet for some, intelligent, and just plain good. Some people may not care for a complex storyline with subplots and impossibilities, but again that's what life is. Ms. Murphy and Ms. Fanning get raves from me and I think they're both the standout talents of their generation. They can handle both comedy and drama with ease, and I hope to see lots more of them. This movie is a /. It's for people who enjoy a feel good movie. If you do, check it out. Adorable; I absolutely adored this movie. The acting is really great. Brittany Murphy has shown she can handle a female lead role. I think Murphy has a lot of charm and talent to be able to capture audience's hearts. She was great in the film. Dakota Fanning has to be one of the greatest child actors ever. She was awesome in I Am Sam and she's shown a different side of her in this film. Uptown Girls has romance, comedy, and those little lessons in life. Sappy fluff; I think this \"thing\" is supposed to be a combo of a couple of themes which have been done and redone countless times in everything from classical literature to film. (A) Self-centered, shallow, materialistic rich person has a life altering lesson in humility which teaches them the best things in life are free and (B) big shot megalomanical adult meets little kid who teaches them the best things in life are simple. An abysmal attempt and screen writing and directing, \"Uptown Girls\" doesn't work as either (A) or (B) and relies solely on the star power of Murphy and Fanning. Panned by the critics and scoring low with the public, this chick flick is best saved for broadcast. (C) emotional struggle with comic relief.; i think this movie is an EMOTIONAL STRUGGLE WITH COMIC RELIEF. my reason of thinking this is because molly's parents died when she was ray's age. and when molly is talking (in an emotional dialog) about how she never said goodbye to her parents, how the plane crashed, how everyones faces faded, how everything people said turned into a blur, and how she ran away to cony island. she could only ride on the teacups since she was alone. later in the movie ray runs away there but nobody knows where she went -- except molly. because they can relate to each other. they struggle together on the tea cup ride just spinning all their emotions out (with beautiful accompaniment, by the way) and then ray is hitting her.. which turns into a hug. beautiful. this important quote in the beginning-middle of the movie ends up more important than you would think:: Ray: Every grown-up is good at something. Oh, my bad. I don't see any grown-ups around here. Molly Gunn: What's so great about being a grown-up anyway? So I can turn out like you? then later at the end of the movie, you here the two of them talk (very sad by the way) about it again. but with a new view on everything:: Ray: You can have your job back, you know. Molly: I don't think so. You and I, we're gonna be friends. Okay? Ray: Grownups never stay friends with kids. Molly: I don't see any grownups around here. Ray: I do. and then the ending number. molly just assumes it is a regular dance recital of ray's. but when the man molly fell for throughout the movie came out and sang \"Molly smiles\" (a song her dad sang as a number one hit..but then died..and molly never wanted to hear it again). then came out the dancers with guitars. and you wonder, where is ray? then you see her come out dance around the girls and fix their guitars.. it was her solo in the song. and who was ray supposed to be throughout the song? molly. i think this is a wonderful movie that you can laugh and cry in. A movie that makes you feel better and better....and better; I actually saw this film by mistake, and couldn't help posting a comment here (which I actually think it's my first, but hey, it deserves it). I think it's a very thoughtful and sensitive movie, with plenty of funny but also moving scenes. Despite my better judgement, Brittany Murphy does a good job at playing the \"confused\" grown-up, while Dakota is a charming, if not absolutely fantastic grown-up \"in the making\". I think this movie is worth watching, at least, if not exclusively, for the terrific relationship between Ray and Molly. I had never expected to grow such fond of these \"Uptown Girls\".... Watch it! It's worth your bucks! Brittany was great, the movie wasn't all that; I think Brittany was too good for this movie. The plot was so simple and obvious.  I was bored when brit was not on screen but overall i was bored the whole time. The acting in this movie was not very good especially that little girl ray. I think brittanys character at the start was horrible, not on her part but on the movies part.  I would not watch this movie again purposely, because I know exactly what happens and it's boring, it has no replay. But maybe since i'm a guy, i could be wrong A funny movie; Brittany Murphy plays Molly Gunn, a woman who becomes the nanny of Ray Schleine (Dakota Fanning), a spoilt brat to earn the respect of her boyfriend. Both Murphy and Fanning excel in their roles, making the movie more and more funny. The pig in itself makes the film worth watching, but with cool roles from Heather Locklear and Donald Faison, not to mention Fanning's wonderful performances, make this film definitely worth the admission of five dollars. Dakota Fanning is budding quite nicely into one of the finer child actresses (like Amanda Bynes, Haley Joel Osment, Frankie Muniz and the Olsen twins; unlike Rory Culkin, Hilary Duff, and Rupert Grint.) Only stay away from this film if you find the spoilt-brat act tiring. But I can assure you, in this film, it never gets tiring. /. Murphy and Fanning are good here, but deserved better; Uptown Girls () Brittany Murphy, Dakota Fanning, Heather Locklear, Marley Shelton, Jesse Spencer, Donald Faison, D: Boaz Yakin. Murphy plays a flighty -year-old orphan, whose rock star parents died when she was younger, and now when she's kicked out of her N.Y. apartment, she realizes she has to start working for a living. Having never been employed in her life, she takes the job as a nanny for Fanning, who is a mature adult trapped in an -year-old girl's body (metaphorically speaking). Film goes in too many directions to be one; beginning as a fairy tale, then a sitcom, and finally a bad drama, overall you have superficial disarray. Supporting characters aren't fleshed out enough, but the leading ladies' characters are well developed and their performances bring charm. Running Time:  minutes and rated PG- for sexual content and language. RATING: ** (out of ****) nd Best Dakota movie I've seen yet; Uptown girls is a great movie. Fanning did a great job on her role. If you have not seen it yet, I would highly recommend it. ;) I might even buy it b/c it was so good. ;) My favorite movie of Fanning is I Am Sam. I have yet to buy that one b/c it was Fanning's st big role in a movie. I'm a big fan. My goal is to see every TV and movie appearance that she has done. The is the #  child actress out there today. I pretty sure she will get a Star on Hollywoods WOF one of these days down the road. She has fun while she works. That's important. Why would you do something that you hate? Dakota #. ;) The Olsen twins can not beat the Fanning sisters. It was a good movie; I saw the movie earlier this afternoon and I would say Uptown Girls was a very good movie. It showed a kid who acted like an adult to act like a kid an adult who acted like a kid to act like an adult.  On this website I think they should put drama before comedy cause this movie can be sad at some parts but it is mainly pretty funny. I definetly suggest for you to go out and watch this movie. Entertaining: Laughter, Tears- Everything I like in a movie.; This movie was not only funny, it was moving and wonderful.  I love Dakota Fanning and she was the reason I went to see the movie and I was not disappointed.  She was very believable and I felt like I was right there with her.  I wish I was better at expressing myself with words because this movie deserves more than I can give it.  Thank you for allowing me to \"voice\" my opinion. I can't wait until this movie is available on DVD. \"Uptown Girls\"  /.  Murphy makes it work and gives this movie its charm.; The plot to \"Uptown Girls\" is that it centers on Molly Gunn (Brittany Murphy), who is the spoiled, -year old daughter of a deceased rock legend.  When the manager steals her money, she's left broke and for the first time in her life, has to actually work.  So she gets a job being a nanny to Ray (Dakota Fanning), the neglected daughter of an overworked music executive.  She doesn't really have much of a choice, since she has no \"real\" working skills or experience being employed.  The two bond and become best friends and so on. True this film's plot slightly resembles Adam Sandler's  comedy \"Big Daddy,\" another film where an irresponsible adult is given the daunting task of playing parent to a neglected child.  Where the more serious moments of the story to \"Big Daddy\" took a back seat to silly toilet humor, \"Uptown Girls\" is able to soar high above the required material and become something truly unique.  \"Big Daddy\" was great, too and got its message (if you can call it that) across without much trouble, and \"Uptown Girls\" does the same, and then something greater. Part of the fun of watching \"Uptown Girls\" is simply Murphy's presence on screen.  Watching this, I had to sometimes remember why she is one of today's youngest and most talented actresses.  Another reason would be her relationship with Dakota Fanning in the movie.  The two naturally start off not liking each other but as the film continues, they grow closer and closer together. I'm a guy and I don't normally like these kinds of movies (girlie-girl films), but \"Uptown Girls\" seems to be an exception, largely because of star Brittany Murphy.  She just has a kind of appeal that draws you in, whether you want to or not.  I guess that's why when I first saw a poster for this film at the movie theater a few months ago, I was drawn in to it, despite any misgivings I already had. Murphy has a magnetic charm, a kind of screen presence that's normally lacking with a lot of young actresses working in today's Hollywood.  Roger Ebert stated in his review of the film that Murphy displays a kind of ineptitude that's reminiscent of the late Lucille Ball and plays it perfectly.  In this film, she is kind of a ditz, but it's all part of her emotional complexity. Another reason I wanted to see \"Uptown Girls\" is because Boaz Yakin, who helmed 's \"Fresh\" and 's \"Remember the Titans,\" is behind the camera.  He has a real eye for the characters in his films, in that he makes them do a lot more than what is expected of them.  This is why his two earlier films were so successful in that they went above and beyond the material to become something really special. I already know that a lot of people are not going to like this movie, but I think that we should at least give it a chance.  It's not going to do well at the box office, but I think bad scheduling (the much-anticipated \"Freddy vs. Jason\" reigned supreme at the box office when \"Girls\" was released) may have had a serious effect on its overall performance. very disappointed; This film was disappointing in so many ways.  To begin with, the plot became trite and nauseating, which is sad because the story itself could have been sweet.  But instead, the combination of badly rendered, overdone characters and predictable,and overdone situations completely ruined the story. Usually, Brittany Murphy gives a strong performance, but in Uptown Girls, she was nothing but obnoxious (throughout the film it seemed like she was trying really hard to be sweet and pretty, but failing miserably at it). Fanning's acting had its moments, but for the most part, her character was too drawn out and unreal.  The directing/editing was actually not too bad at certain points in the film, but the acting and the plot overshadowed it. All in all, the movie was a complete waste of time and it leaves you with nothing you haven't already felt a million times before in other films. An absolute charmer; This movie is fabulous. It is the film equivalent of cotton candy with some smartness. Sweet, funny ,and charming . Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning are a dynamo team in this film about growing up. It skips the hard stuff. It's a grade A chick flick with some brains that really shows an honest relationship between two women. The best thing about this film is how it flips the rolls. Fanning is the grown up and Murphy is the child. Switching the rolls in this films is a smart move and a refreshing one at that. Remember when you see this film to enjoy but not take this TOO seriously. It is a just chick flick. Go out and get this film to watch with your girls or gays. :) Its entertaining and fluffy comedy that has some sense of brains. Murphy is a great talent who has that lucile ball charm. She radiates the screen every time she is on. Such a great talent she was. Shame we lost her so early.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Chick flick - sunday viewing; Not worthy of an Oscar, but then how many films are? Perfect viewing for a lazy Sunday, with popcorn and a mug of hot chocolate. Kristin Davis is ideally suited as the wife who is killed in a car accident on christmas eve. Her neglectful husband is given the last three days of her life to prove his love to her. The perfect, made for tv movie. Best still, it doesn't irritate the tear ducts and there is just enough saccharine to stomach!! Recommended! ehhhh....; I was pretty stoked for this, thinking it would be a touching Christmas movie, probably shed a few tears &amp; rejoice in the grand feelings of love &amp; family that are most often celebrated during Christmastime.  Nope.  It just wasn't there for me with this.  Twas kinda interesting seeing Tim Meadows in this role as the angel since I'm a fan of his from his Saturday Night Live days (which'll forever be in reruns!)  He did a nice job but his part was small.  Kristin Davis was great!  I think what brought this down was the husband character played by Reed Diamond just stunk.  Mr. Diamond's acting didn't stink that bad but his character was such a dunce.  Made me wonder how a woman like Ms. Davis' character could've married this dweeb.  Of course we pretty much darn well knew what was gonna happen in the end.  Usually with a Christmas movie that isn't bad but here there just wasn't a whole heckuva lot of substance leading up to the climax nor was there much to go \"Awwwwwww\" about afterwards.  I felt this was only average, maybe even just a bit below that line leaning a little bit towards boring.  Oh well.  Most Christmas movies work just fine.  I don't think this one did.  One thing that did work just fine, i just remembered, was the scenery in the small town that was supposed to be somewhere on the New England coast.  Just beautiful and what Christmas should be (in my opinion!)  Overall, though, this only gets a grade of: C+ (the + because of Kristin Davis and the scenery.) Very sweet and simple movie...; that stirs a few thoughts here and there as a reminder, for those that are too busy with their daily chores and goals, that they forget to see what's around them and cherish the moment. The main actors did a pretty decent job, where Reed always had a stiff face to show his unhappiness. It did get a bit irritating at a point as a viewer, because you just want to slap him for not doing something about anything... Kristin Davis is great as usual with the roles as a sweet and sensitive lady. Her acting and cuteness simply makes hearts melt in this case, even if it can be seen as corny... But that's just how life is... She did a great job showing her emotions and didn't overdo any of the parts, which simply made it worthwhile and gave an effect. The movie could definitely have been made with a much greater emotional and serious impact... as it had a lot of potential. But I don't believe that the movie was meant to be like that. This is definitely a movie to check out with an open mind, to be able to have the full effect. If one starts watching it with a critical mind, then you won't enjoy it at all. But as a nice simple Christmas story, it is great fun and can be noted as one of the best sappy ones out there :). Three Days is a favorite of mine.; Great film, not the best Christmas movie of all time, but absolutely one that warms the spirit and makes you appreciate the simple things in life, and those you share it all with. The film contains a great deal of moral fiber and contains many useful lessons for life and sensing the importance of making your feelings known to those you love, because one never knows how long one will have to do so. The acting performances are definitely noteworthy, and above the average par of TV network programming. I didn't see it on TV this past Holiday season, and was disappointed I must admit. I hope to sit down, together with my wife, in front of a warm fire amidst a serene snowfall next Christmas and enjoy it together. Enthusiastically Recommended. A lot of wasted potential, but not bad *Spoilers Ahead*; I've just seen this film after flicking through the channels and it was about as subtle as a sledgehammer. In the first twenty minutes it became obvious as soon as Kristin Davis' character found the dog Lulu that she was going to get hit by a car. Even though I was aware it wasn't going to be the most intelligent film I've seen it did start showing potential when Diamond's character met Lionel. Unfortunately this opportunity to do something vaguely interested was blown away as soon as he freely admitted to being an angel. What followed was your usual Movie Land Christmas Sentimental fare. Snow ball fights, Christmas trees etc. As the film got closer to its end I found myself hoping that it would be allowed to finish with a little mystery or even perhaps an unconventional happy ending but that turned out to be wishful thinking. It soon became obvious that he would have to give up his own life which he did. Unfortunately though, the film makers pushed a little too hard for a happy ending which left us with the last minute, the most unbearable, saccharine filled conclusion I've seen in a while. In general the cast is below par. As another reviewer pointed out, Diamond's character is almost moronic at points and I still resent Lionel being so open about who he was so some of his rather poor jokes only compounded my dislike of him, Davis though gets to stand out with her acting. Overall it's no where near being great but it's a nice little movie to watch on a quiet winters afternoon, just make sure you switch it off once Reed Diamond has died. Great TV Christmas Movie, Could have easily been  released in theatres.; A few years ago, I turned on ABC family in hopes of being treated to a nice average quality holiday movie (mostly as a time killer). What I found was this film. I sat through the two hour movie and was kept glued to the TV every minute. After the two hours were over I had found a new Christmas classic. The story is about a literary agent Andrew Farmer (Reed Diamond), who during a business trip comes dangerously close to having an affair. He returns to his house on Christmas eve to find his wife Beth (Kristin Davis) who thinking he cheated, storms out of their apartment in anger, only to be hit by a car and killed. An angel (Tim Meadows) comes to Andrew and offers him of a very special gift. He will get to relive the last  days over again; however there is a catch. After those three days Beth will still die. But he can use that time to prove to her how much he loves her. During those  days they return to their home town and Andrew reconnects to a version of himself that he thought was long gone while rediscovering his love for his wife. But when the angel reappears and hints there may be a way to prevent the current course of events if he truly convinces his wife he still loves her, Andrew must race against the clock to find the perfect Christmas gift for her. One of the best things about this movie is the casting. Reed Diamond and Kristin Davis have great chemistry together, and it is really believable that they actually are husband and wife. Tim Meadows takes a drastic move from his usual comical roles and does a great job as the somber and wise angel who gives Andrew this magical gift. The movie may be a bit saccharine at times and it is a little predictable, but considering that it is made for TV and a Christmas movie (two genres that have overwhelmingly been dominated by garbage) the producers of this movie came out with flying colors. The only question is why they decided to make this straight to TV. Considering the quality, with a few tiny adjustments, this movie could have easily been released in theatres. Hopefully, ABC will wise up and release this one on DVD. Overall it was a great movie to watch during the holiday season and I recommend it to everyone. Definitely one of my favorite Christmas movies. wonderful!!!!; I thought this movie was truly wonderful, with the underlying theme that we must remember to show others how much we love them, because soon, it may be too late. i cried some, but i loved this so much. The actors were great, though i wasnt familiar with many of them. I would definitely recommend it if you love sad but sweet movies :-) movie; This movie is truly excellent! Every year my daughter and I watch this movie on Christmas Eve on ABC family, but for the last two years or so they have not played it.My daughter is really upset since it was a tradition we made when she was very little. So if any body could tell me where i can get this movie please let me know. If you are looking for a movie to snuggle up with your girlfriend,wife,daughter or son this is very much so the movie to do that with. It tells of the story about a man and his wife, and how he takes advantage of her love. It sends a very good message out to all ages. I would highly recommend Three Days to anybody wanting to know about a good, warm and comforting movie to watch on a Saturday night. A forced happy ending that's not prolly even necessary; Why are American filmmakers always compelled to force happy endings? This one's not even necessary (probably), but the producers must have felt it desperately needed, for they kept making the ending blatantly obvious, and more so as the movie went on. As for the movie, it got better towards the end as you feel more for the characters. I'd give it a B- just for potential. You'll be left wondering if YOU can do a better job, though. great..; Its a great movie for Ladies also for men, but in my opinion its more of a chick flick. No offense to anyone out there.... My advice: have a box of Kleenex next to you, when you watch it. It was well done/ well written. I just saw this movie last week for the first time in a while, it was terrific. Kristin Davis did an amazing job, like she always does. Tim Meadows also did a great job here. So did the other actors. :) The movie gives you drama, leaves you wondering whats going to happen next. It has good morals to it. It has a good ending. i totally think people should see this movie. Its great for the family. Saccharine; Watchable and feel-good in the \"It's a Wonderful Life\" style, but nowhere near as clever as It's a Wonderful Life. Stereotyped characters, script is sugary and predictable, a  year old could have written it. Overall, not one to pay to watch. It had everything you would expect from a sugary movie - an irritating angel, snow, Christmas trees, children and candy, saving a child's life (including a very bad demonstration of CPR - you wouldn't save anybody's life if you did it like that), childhood reminiscences, parental reconciliations, refusal to participate in an extra-marital affair, morality lessons etc, etc. We've seen this before; Wow. This movie was so predictable and it had so many plot holes. When a man's wife dies, he is given three days to be with her again and to prove her love to her. I knew exactly how the movie would end. By the way, the movie keeps getting cheesier as it goes. Yet, I gave this movie a decent  stars. The concept isn't bad, even though we've seen it before, but it is delivered as sappy, melodramatic, and of course predictable. Still, the acting is actually pretty good all around. I was especially impressed with Reed Diamond's performance. I'm also a big fan of Kristin Davis and she amazes me here! Tim Meadows is funny yet philosophical as the \"angel\". Yeah. \"It's A Wonderful Life, Part II.\" Still, the acting is good enough to keep this movie floating. Barely floating, though. A great feel good Christmas film.; I love this film. I saw it at Christmas in  on T.V. in England. My mum had just died  months before so i was very sad and grieving still. It was an emotional film but has an angel in it and a very good storyline. The timing of it was perfect for me and helped make me feel a little better. The acting is very good. It's the sort of film i wished they put on TV every Christmas. I recorded it as the review was good, so luckily i still have it on tape to watch. My  year old daughter likes it too. Hope you all enjoy it too. Sweet and entertaining...even if predictable; I really enjoyed this movie even if I could predict the ending. Actually, the predictability really only occurs in the last  minutes or so, so they almost had me believing it would end like it should. Even still, it's a nice, cozy movie to watch with a cup of cocoa. The story is about Beth and Andrew, a Boston couple. Andrew is a superbusy literary agent, and Beth is a yoga instructor. Clearly, differences in personalities. They've been together for  years when they lived in the little town of Mahone Bay back as kids. Anyway, as the story goes, Andrew is late for their tradition of picking a Christmas tree. He also drops on Beth that he has to fly to Chi on business on Christmas Eve. She's upset, but she knows that there's nothing she can say or do to change his mind. Now, what Andy doesn't tell her is that his colleague, Kimberly, is going along for the trip. Beth finds out when she calls his hotel and Kimberly answers the phone. Andy has a change of heart, and returns home to be with his wife... Beth is justifiably angry, and leaves the house. Andrew follows after her and witnesses her get hit by a car. At the hospital, the doctor gives grave news. Andrew returns home, and finds his key doesn't work. This leads him to the \"locksmith\" shop across the street. Here he meets Lionel (Tim Meadows) who after a conversation, grants him  more days (aka the last three days) with Beth in order to redo his damage. Beth is still scheduled to die on Christmas Eve, but Andrew is given a chance to prove to her that he loves her. So this is the set up. They spend the next  days visiting their hometown and reconnecting with their past. The typical overheard conversation occurs and that sends Beth back to Boston by herself (it's the Kimberly thing, only in a different setup). So Andrew, knowing his time w/her is running out,struggles w/how to prove it to her. Beth gives him some good news that she's been holding on to, but it doesn't change her destiny. The angel won't give him more time, but asks him if he would do anything to keep Beth from dying. You can probably predict what happens next. The beginning of the movie is basically reversed, right up until the last  minutes. Like I said, it's really predictable, but that doesn't ruin the enjoyment.</td>\n",

       "9206   A good dramedy.; This is actually a nine or eight star film if you are open to it. The critics have lost their capacity to enjoy films, much like the Fanning character in the movie. But, for them, sadly, there is no redemption. Fanning is brilliant, every time she opens her mouth she touches your heart. Murphy is very good, and as one IMDb user has written, \"adults probably wrote it off as a 'kids movie' and the kids didn't understand the emotional plot line\"....interesting explanation as to why the film did only  million domestically. Who is the audience for this film? What age? Women, from fourteen to thirty, probably. The only fault I can think of is it moves too fast to get to the story, and a few more nuances would have made it a little more palpable. I liked this film. Even if it goes nice at the second hour of it, its first hour blows everything.; ** out of **** Uptown Girls is a movie which shows us two persons, one is a woman who acts entirely as a child and the other one is a child who acts entirely like a grown up person, or as the movie may suggest: a woman. Unfortunately it seems that it doesn't work that way. The \"woman\", played by Brittany Murphy doesn't do anything in the movie that may be classified as a job. At least, in the beginning of it. But when she can't afford to stay in her apartment building anymore, she's kicked out and now must find a job. Murphy's character to begin is horrible! She actually doesn't need to speak any lines in order for the movie to play childish soundtrack for her, she only needs to show up on screen. And when she speaks, the movie plays stupid songs, which fit in a way, we may say: what a stupid comedy movie, it almost seems like a TV movie... She must find a job to save her life and that leads her to become a babysitter of the child who she met in her own birthday party. This child is Dakota Fanning's character. For her, I have only four words: good performance, bad role. The real problem with Fanning is that she performs great, but her character sucks! It's a character we immediately skip any possible chance of getting sympathy. She's just too serious, acts like a grown up person, listening to Mozart (can you believe it?), skipping fun, talking in a harsh way to her babysitter and the list goes on forever. Just watch the movie and you'll understand. Fanning would be much more interesting in other roles, specially in villain roles. She could play the daughter of a witch in a horror movie the way she plays in Uptwon Girls, who knows? There are other things in the plot including a handsome boy that Murphy falls in love with, Fanning's bale scenes and the need of Murphy to get rid of her father's guitars. Now that was the problem of Uptown Girls with the characters. It's sad that the only two special characters of the movie are the only ones who screw it. But the real problem with this movie is its first hour. It's not even a comedy movie, it's pure childish, stupid and irritating. Just when Fanning starts to inspire sympathy to her father is when the movie starts to get interesting because we see scenes of Murphy and Fanning interacting with each other much greater than before, as wee see them for the first time trying to get real adults conversations. Unfortunately that's only the second hour of the movie. As for my mother who watched the movie with me, she said: this \"water with sugar\" actually didn't end so bad. Sadly, maybe Uptown Girls might have needed some more sugar. Or even, the sands of time from Prince Of Persia to turn back time and do what must be done: make Murphy grown up and Fanning grown down! I enjoyed it; I just had an Uncle's day out with four of my nieces.  After lunch we saw this movie.  Much to my chagrin this is the movie the girls picked. Wow -- I was pleasantly surprised.  It had a few rough areas that others have commented on but overall an enjoyable movie. Yikes -- have I really said this? Really Great.....; This is a really great movie. It could be a little sappy at times but is a feel good chick flick that I saw in the theater....with no regrets. Brittany Murphy does an excellent job of playing Molly....a girl who all her life got everything she wanted after her rockstar parents died and she got everything....when there is a problem with the money Molly must resort to *dare she think it* get a job. She gets a job as a nanny for a little girl that has way to much on her mind for her age. With the little girl's father being very very sick and her work-a-holic mother, she can't trust anything. Molly tries to change that. Dakota Fanning does a great job for a young actress. She is a real talent. All and all I thought this movie was really good and have even considered buying it. I give it  out of  stars.....try watching it! worth a look! enjoy! There is magic...; Indeed, in this movie we learn that magic is real, that the power to bring a smile on someone's face is in our hands, it lays within us, in our beliefs. What I loved about this movie is (well, I also fell in love with Mu, the pig) the resemblance with reality. As kids we usually act grown-up, we really lung to get to adulthood and when we're there we're lost in our own wish and don't know how to act anymore. What we can learn from this movie is to act accordingly to our age, to stop wasting our childhood with grown-up attitudes, to understand that smiling, laughing and playing are normal and desirable for that age. And as adults, I guess we can keep some of the childhood features. With so much grief around us, I don't see why we shouldn't be the ones to make the others smile. Watch the movie, you've got only to gain from it. this movie sucked; This is the worst movie ive ever seen.  I have not seen Gigli, but i imagine it cant be worst, but people tell me that it is, and i dont know how that is possible. My favorite part was the end. i mean the credits not the stupid guitar dance. that was the stupidest part. Moo was the best character. he was the only one who didn't talk. Boaz Yakin  is my cup of tea; Boaz Yakin is someone I've been following since he wrote and directed 's FRESH, which is one of the best films I've ever seen. None of his subsequent projects have had the power of that movie but I'm an unbelievably loyal Leo, and I will keep seeing anything the man writes and/or directs. This one, Uptown Girls, is directed by Yakin, and it does display his knack for getting decent interaction from his performers; there are some extremely believable scenes between Murphy and Fanning, in particular, who both manage, under his direction and thanks to their innate talent (especially the soon-to-be-legendary Fanning's), to breathe genuine life into their potentially one-dimensional characters. I hadn't read anything about the movie beforehand, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it play out not as a farce but rather as a skewed and quirky buddy movie, with both characters learning from each other what it means to be human, at any age. Good use of subordinate characters as well, and although the film is hardly a masterpiece by any stretch, it most definitely has its heart in the right place. It is a girly film but don't let that distract you!; Well as a bloke with a strong feminine streak (somewhere!) inside, I have to say that I sat down this afternoon and watched this movie with my girlfriend and ended up laughing and crying with her. OK the first  mins take there toll but it does pick up in a warm and snuggly way that identifies with anyone who has loved and lost. I am not saying that this film is perfect or brilliant, just that it is a good story, well acted and delivered and worthy of an evening or afternoon cuddling with your other half and enjoying it for all it is. A girly film which delivers exactly what is on the box, and if one wishes to nit pick, one can, but why bother? Enjoy it for what it is. Matcho guys need not apply, nor watch, cos there is bog all that will turn your nuts! Nuff said ! **** out of  (and this is from a bloke who HAS loved and lost!)  Ehh...; When I went to see Uptown Girls, I had high expectations and they weren't really fulfilled. Molly is  a spoiled brat who basically gets whatever she wants, and what she wants is the cute new guy (Jesse Spencer) she meets. However, she doesn't have the time or money to keep their relationship up after her vault runs dry and must become the nanny to stuck-up, stiff Ray (Dakota Fanning). I am usually a chick-flick person, but this was forgettable and the plot was very thin and kept changing directions. It was entertaining and had its funny moments, but it looked a lot better in the trailers (doesn't it always?). The acting was good, for the most part, and I think Dakota Fanning is great, but I just don't think I'd be able to sit through this movie again. It felt unresolved at the end, even though it seemed like someone was yelling \"The solution is that there is no solution\". Overall, it was OK, but not worth the nine bucks I was charged. A modern fable bundled up in an ethereal dream.; This movie was wonderful! A hypnotic modern fairy tale, it recounts the story of a beautiful princess and her charmed life in her New York City penthouse... and the blow-by-blow destruction of the delusions that kept up that sheltered existence. Brittany Murphy succeeds as the enchanted, ethereal Molly... in a swirling, twirling, whimsical performance that evokes the images of Jean Cocteau's Elise from Les Enfants Terribles. Once in awhile in life we run into people who frustrate us because of their chronic inability to set their two feet down and stand tall, and in that respect I could understand how Molly's character wouldn't be engaging to all audiences. However, for many who have known Mollys or who are like Molly, innocent and unspoiled purity thrust into a fiercely insensitive world, Molly's character evokes good-natured sympathy. One remarkable thing of the film is that Molly, though portrayed through the reactions she gets from the people who surround her, is clearly spoiled, and yet the audience would have to rely on its own gut reaction to spoiled children, because the director gives a merciful and empathetic eye to Molly (who most of us will not be able to dislike no matter how much her deludedness disgusts us!)... from Molly's point of view, she is just a bright and wide-eyed child observing the world from a lens of imaginative affluence. It is hardly her fault she comes from a background of wealth, and lives extravagently... yet we do not get a sense that the wealth is the most important thing for her... she just wants to live the best she can in her own circumstances... which we see proved as she slowly adjusts to the bourgeoius lifestyle she must adapt to that provides the plot of the film. Molly gains strength and makes many decisions that reflect her integrity, and while a part of her will remain in the dappled candlelit world of sensuality and abandon... she can dwell in the fast-paced reality of the working world with a resolve almost as ferocious as her love for beauty. The onset of the film may provide cynics with satisfaction at the progressive deconstruction of Molly's delirious existence... but cynics will have a sour taste in their mouth as they watch Molly grow, and almost root against her evolution... because a girl who has had everything handed to her succeeds at growing up while remaining who she is at the core. We can all get a little jealous of those whose lives are so charmed, the ones destined for greatness while so many of us toil and labor for most of our lives to recieve just half of the self-realization and fulfillment Molly experiences. But after all, it is not comparing our challenging lives to the seemingly easier  lives of others' that should motivate us to be ambitious, it is the satisfaction of our own hard work and the willingness to do it... as we learn from Molly. This film has told my story. Poignant and made with integrity, it is not a simple comedy. In fact, the way the film conveys romantic relationships is done with a sense of realism. The characters are definitely substantial and realistic... just because you've never met people like them doesn't mean that there isn't an abundance of deludanoids populating the penthouses of the Upper West Side, or the palaces of California. Brittany Murphy has struck gold again. A refreshing follow up to the somewhat lackluster Just Married, or the downright creepy (but engaging!) Spun. **/ stars out of ; Brittney Murphy and Dakota Fanning star as a very childish -year old and a very mature -year old in a movie that is pretty flawless. That is if you're a pre-teen and a girl. Everything from the heavy use of peppy teen music, to the shiny lights and purples and pinks decorating the sets and wardrobe to Brittney herself create a mood characteristic of a modern Cinderella story. For the rest of us, it might not be your cup of tea depending on how far removed you are from  and your gender, but it still has its moments. Brittney proves herself capable of creating movie magic on screen showing us her childish side, even if she overdoes it a little. As for her counterpart, Fanning holds up ok except that the writers didn't create a very convincing -year old. On the whole, the movie is rather intelligent and deals with some weighty material (death of a parent, neglect, etc) that is quite powerful. A lot better than you've heard; I'm really surprised by the nasty reviews I've read for this movie. I thought it was one of the better movies I've seen lately. One thing though. I think it's more of a drama than a comedy so the ads may be a little misleading, (spoilers) This story is about two young women who aren't really as different as you might think. They both are the product of a privileged music industry upbringing but have reacted to it in a completely different ways. Molly goes with it and becomes the gypsy/groupie type and Ray rebels by becoming an ultra uptight Ms. Perfect. They're brought together by mutual crisis, no nanny can deal with Ray and Molly desperately needs a job. Naturally there is friction between the two but they both realize that they need each other for more than one reason. Throughout the film Molly learns responsibility by mothering Ray who really hasn't had any nurturing to speak of. By having someone to take care of her, Ray is allowed to let her guard down and be a kid. There are bumps along the way because that's how life is. But they come through it together and I think the tea cup scene at the end is a great moment of transition and healing for both characters. By helping Ray deal with her current trauma (the death of her father), Molly is able to deal with her past trauma (the death of her parents). There is such a connection there between the two actresses, it's just beautiful really. Some people may think it's hokey, but I think it's very true to life. In essence this is a heartwarming story about two people who desperately need a fairy godmother. And  they become that for each other. It's sweet, maybe too sweet for some, intelligent, and just plain good. Some people may not care for a complex storyline with subplots and impossibilities, but again that's what life is. Ms. Murphy and Ms. Fanning get raves from me and I think they're both the standout talents of their generation. They can handle both comedy and drama with ease, and I hope to see lots more of them. This movie is a /. It's for people who enjoy a feel good movie. If you do, check it out. Adorable; I absolutely adored this movie. The acting is really great. Brittany Murphy has shown she can handle a female lead role. I think Murphy has a lot of charm and talent to be able to capture audience's hearts. She was great in the film. Dakota Fanning has to be one of the greatest child actors ever. She was awesome in I Am Sam and she's shown a different side of her in this film. Uptown Girls has romance, comedy, and those little lessons in life. Sappy fluff; I think this \"thing\" is supposed to be a combo of a couple of themes which have been done and redone countless times in everything from classical literature to film. (A) Self-centered, shallow, materialistic rich person has a life altering lesson in humility which teaches them the best things in life are free and (B) big shot megalomanical adult meets little kid who teaches them the best things in life are simple. An abysmal attempt and screen writing and directing, \"Uptown Girls\" doesn't work as either (A) or (B) and relies solely on the star power of Murphy and Fanning. Panned by the critics and scoring low with the public, this chick flick is best saved for broadcast. (C) emotional struggle with comic relief.; i think this movie is an EMOTIONAL STRUGGLE WITH COMIC RELIEF. my reason of thinking this is because molly's parents died when she was ray's age. and when molly is talking (in an emotional dialog) about how she never said goodbye to her parents, how the plane crashed, how everyones faces faded, how everything people said turned into a blur, and how she ran away to cony island. she could only ride on the teacups since she was alone. later in the movie ray runs away there but nobody knows where she went -- except molly. because they can relate to each other. they struggle together on the tea cup ride just spinning all their emotions out (with beautiful accompaniment, by the way) and then ray is hitting her.. which turns into a hug. beautiful. this important quote in the beginning-middle of the movie ends up more important than you would think:: Ray: Every grown-up is good at something. Oh, my bad. I don't see any grown-ups around here. Molly Gunn: What's so great about being a grown-up anyway? So I can turn out like you? then later at the end of the movie, you here the two of them talk (very sad by the way) about it again. but with a new view on everything:: Ray: You can have your job back, you know. Molly: I don't think so. You and I, we're gonna be friends. Okay? Ray: Grownups never stay friends with kids. Molly: I don't see any grownups around here. Ray: I do. and then the ending number. molly just assumes it is a regular dance recital of ray's. but when the man molly fell for throughout the movie came out and sang \"Molly smiles\" (a song her dad sang as a number one hit..but then died..and molly never wanted to hear it again). then came out the dancers with guitars. and you wonder, where is ray? then you see her come out dance around the girls and fix their guitars.. it was her solo in the song. and who was ray supposed to be throughout the song? molly. i think this is a wonderful movie that you can laugh and cry in. A movie that makes you feel better and better....and better; I actually saw this film by mistake, and couldn't help posting a comment here (which I actually think it's my first, but hey, it deserves it). I think it's a very thoughtful and sensitive movie, with plenty of funny but also moving scenes. Despite my better judgement, Brittany Murphy does a good job at playing the \"confused\" grown-up, while Dakota is a charming, if not absolutely fantastic grown-up \"in the making\". I think this movie is worth watching, at least, if not exclusively, for the terrific relationship between Ray and Molly. I had never expected to grow such fond of these \"Uptown Girls\".... Watch it! It's worth your bucks! Brittany was great, the movie wasn't all that; I think Brittany was too good for this movie. The plot was so simple and obvious.  I was bored when brit was not on screen but overall i was bored the whole time. The acting in this movie was not very good especially that little girl ray. I think brittanys character at the start was horrible, not on her part but on the movies part.  I would not watch this movie again purposely, because I know exactly what happens and it's boring, it has no replay. But maybe since i'm a guy, i could be wrong A funny movie; Brittany Murphy plays Molly Gunn, a woman who becomes the nanny of Ray Schleine (Dakota Fanning), a spoilt brat to earn the respect of her boyfriend. Both Murphy and Fanning excel in their roles, making the movie more and more funny. The pig in itself makes the film worth watching, but with cool roles from Heather Locklear and Donald Faison, not to mention Fanning's wonderful performances, make this film definitely worth the admission of five dollars. Dakota Fanning is budding quite nicely into one of the finer child actresses (like Amanda Bynes, Haley Joel Osment, Frankie Muniz and the Olsen twins; unlike Rory Culkin, Hilary Duff, and Rupert Grint.) Only stay away from this film if you find the spoilt-brat act tiring. But I can assure you, in this film, it never gets tiring. /. Murphy and Fanning are good here, but deserved better; Uptown Girls () Brittany Murphy, Dakota Fanning, Heather Locklear, Marley Shelton, Jesse Spencer, Donald Faison, D: Boaz Yakin. Murphy plays a flighty -year-old orphan, whose rock star parents died when she was younger, and now when she's kicked out of her N.Y. apartment, she realizes she has to start working for a living. Having never been employed in her life, she takes the job as a nanny for Fanning, who is a mature adult trapped in an -year-old girl's body (metaphorically speaking). Film goes in too many directions to be one; beginning as a fairy tale, then a sitcom, and finally a bad drama, overall you have superficial disarray. Supporting characters aren't fleshed out enough, but the leading ladies' characters are well developed and their performances bring charm. Running Time:  minutes and rated PG- for sexual content and language. RATING: ** (out of ****) nd Best Dakota movie I've seen yet; Uptown girls is a great movie. Fanning did a great job on her role. If you have not seen it yet, I would highly recommend it. ;) I might even buy it b/c it was so good. ;) My favorite movie of Fanning is I Am Sam. I have yet to buy that one b/c it was Fanning's st big role in a movie. I'm a big fan. My goal is to see every TV and movie appearance that she has done. The is the #  child actress out there today. I pretty sure she will get a Star on Hollywoods WOF one of these days down the road. She has fun while she works. That's important. Why would you do something that you hate? Dakota #. ;) The Olsen twins can not beat the Fanning sisters. It was a good movie; I saw the movie earlier this afternoon and I would say Uptown Girls was a very good movie. It showed a kid who acted like an adult to act like a kid an adult who acted like a kid to act like an adult.  On this website I think they should put drama before comedy cause this movie can be sad at some parts but it is mainly pretty funny. I definetly suggest for you to go out and watch this movie. Entertaining: Laughter, Tears- Everything I like in a movie.; This movie was not only funny, it was moving and wonderful.  I love Dakota Fanning and she was the reason I went to see the movie and I was not disappointed.  She was very believable and I felt like I was right there with her.  I wish I was better at expressing myself with words because this movie deserves more than I can give it.  Thank you for allowing me to \"voice\" my opinion. I can't wait until this movie is available on DVD. \"Uptown Girls\"  /.  Murphy makes it work and gives this movie its charm.; The plot to \"Uptown Girls\" is that it centers on Molly Gunn (Brittany Murphy), who is the spoiled, -year old daughter of a deceased rock legend.  When the manager steals her money, she's left broke and for the first time in her life, has to actually work.  So she gets a job being a nanny to Ray (Dakota Fanning), the neglected daughter of an overworked music executive.  She doesn't really have much of a choice, since she has no \"real\" working skills or experience being employed.  The two bond and become best friends and so on. True this film's plot slightly resembles Adam Sandler's  comedy \"Big Daddy,\" another film where an irresponsible adult is given the daunting task of playing parent to a neglected child.  Where the more serious moments of the story to \"Big Daddy\" took a back seat to silly toilet humor, \"Uptown Girls\" is able to soar high above the required material and become something truly unique.  \"Big Daddy\" was great, too and got its message (if you can call it that) across without much trouble, and \"Uptown Girls\" does the same, and then something greater. Part of the fun of watching \"Uptown Girls\" is simply Murphy's presence on screen.  Watching this, I had to sometimes remember why she is one of today's youngest and most talented actresses.  Another reason would be her relationship with Dakota Fanning in the movie.  The two naturally start off not liking each other but as the film continues, they grow closer and closer together. I'm a guy and I don't normally like these kinds of movies (girlie-girl films), but \"Uptown Girls\" seems to be an exception, largely because of star Brittany Murphy.  She just has a kind of appeal that draws you in, whether you want to or not.  I guess that's why when I first saw a poster for this film at the movie theater a few months ago, I was drawn in to it, despite any misgivings I already had. Murphy has a magnetic charm, a kind of screen presence that's normally lacking with a lot of young actresses working in today's Hollywood.  Roger Ebert stated in his review of the film that Murphy displays a kind of ineptitude that's reminiscent of the late Lucille Ball and plays it perfectly.  In this film, she is kind of a ditz, but it's all part of her emotional complexity. Another reason I wanted to see \"Uptown Girls\" is because Boaz Yakin, who helmed 's \"Fresh\" and 's \"Remember the Titans,\" is behind the camera.  He has a real eye for the characters in his films, in that he makes them do a lot more than what is expected of them.  This is why his two earlier films were so successful in that they went above and beyond the material to become something really special. I already know that a lot of people are not going to like this movie, but I think that we should at least give it a chance.  It's not going to do well at the box office, but I think bad scheduling (the much-anticipated \"Freddy vs. Jason\" reigned supreme at the box office when \"Girls\" was released) may have had a serious effect on its overall performance. very disappointed; This film was disappointing in so many ways.  To begin with, the plot became trite and nauseating, which is sad because the story itself could have been sweet.  But instead, the combination of badly rendered, overdone characters and predictable,and overdone situations completely ruined the story. Usually, Brittany Murphy gives a strong performance, but in Uptown Girls, she was nothing but obnoxious (throughout the film it seemed like she was trying really hard to be sweet and pretty, but failing miserably at it). Fanning's acting had its moments, but for the most part, her character was too drawn out and unreal.  The directing/editing was actually not too bad at certain points in the film, but the acting and the plot overshadowed it. All in all, the movie was a complete waste of time and it leaves you with nothing you haven't already felt a million times before in other films. An absolute charmer; This movie is fabulous. It is the film equivalent of cotton candy with some smartness. Sweet, funny ,and charming . Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning are a dynamo team in this film about growing up. It skips the hard stuff. It's a grade A chick flick with some brains that really shows an honest relationship between two women. The best thing about this film is how it flips the rolls. Fanning is the grown up and Murphy is the child. Switching the rolls in this films is a smart move and a refreshing one at that. Remember when you see this film to enjoy but not take this TOO seriously. It is a just chick flick. Go out and get this film to watch with your girls or gays. :) Its entertaining and fluffy comedy that has some sense of brains. Murphy is a great talent who has that lucile ball charm. She radiates the screen every time she is on. Such a great talent she was. Shame we lost her so early.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Chick flick - sunday viewing; Not worthy of an Oscar, but then how many films are? Perfect viewing for a lazy Sunday, with popcorn and a mug of hot chocolate. Kristin Davis is ideally suited as the wife who is killed in a car accident on christmas eve. Her neglectful husband is given the last three days of her life to prove his love to her. The perfect, made for tv movie. Best still, it doesn't irritate the tear ducts and there is just enough saccharine to stomach!! Recommended! ehhhh....; I was pretty stoked for this, thinking it would be a touching Christmas movie, probably shed a few tears & rejoice in the grand feelings of love & family that are most often celebrated during Christmastime.  Nope.  It just wasn't there for me with this.  Twas kinda interesting seeing Tim Meadows in this role as the angel since I'm a fan of his from his Saturday Night Live days (which'll forever be in reruns!)  He did a nice job but his part was small.  Kristin Davis was great!  I think what brought this down was the husband character played by Reed Diamond just stunk.  Mr. Diamond's acting didn't stink that bad but his character was such a dunce.  Made me wonder how a woman like Ms. Davis' character could've married this dweeb.  Of course we pretty much darn well knew what was gonna happen in the end.  Usually with a Christmas movie that isn't bad but here there just wasn't a whole heckuva lot of substance leading up to the climax nor was there much to go \"Awwwwwww\" about afterwards.  I felt this was only average, maybe even just a bit below that line leaning a little bit towards boring.  Oh well.  Most Christmas movies work just fine.  I don't think this one did.  One thing that did work just fine, i just remembered, was the scenery in the small town that was supposed to be somewhere on the New England coast.  Just beautiful and what Christmas should be (in my opinion!)  Overall, though, this only gets a grade of: C+ (the + because of Kristin Davis and the scenery.) Very sweet and simple movie...; that stirs a few thoughts here and there as a reminder, for those that are too busy with their daily chores and goals, that they forget to see what's around them and cherish the moment. The main actors did a pretty decent job, where Reed always had a stiff face to show his unhappiness. It did get a bit irritating at a point as a viewer, because you just want to slap him for not doing something about anything... Kristin Davis is great as usual with the roles as a sweet and sensitive lady. Her acting and cuteness simply makes hearts melt in this case, even if it can be seen as corny... But that's just how life is... She did a great job showing her emotions and didn't overdo any of the parts, which simply made it worthwhile and gave an effect. The movie could definitely have been made with a much greater emotional and serious impact... as it had a lot of potential. But I don't believe that the movie was meant to be like that. This is definitely a movie to check out with an open mind, to be able to have the full effect. If one starts watching it with a critical mind, then you won't enjoy it at all. But as a nice simple Christmas story, it is great fun and can be noted as one of the best sappy ones out there :). Three Days is a favorite of mine.; Great film, not the best Christmas movie of all time, but absolutely one that warms the spirit and makes you appreciate the simple things in life, and those you share it all with. The film contains a great deal of moral fiber and contains many useful lessons for life and sensing the importance of making your feelings known to those you love, because one never knows how long one will have to do so. The acting performances are definitely noteworthy, and above the average par of TV network programming. I didn't see it on TV this past Holiday season, and was disappointed I must admit. I hope to sit down, together with my wife, in front of a warm fire amidst a serene snowfall next Christmas and enjoy it together. Enthusiastically Recommended. A lot of wasted potential, but not bad *Spoilers Ahead*; I've just seen this film after flicking through the channels and it was about as subtle as a sledgehammer. In the first twenty minutes it became obvious as soon as Kristin Davis' character found the dog Lulu that she was going to get hit by a car. Even though I was aware it wasn't going to be the most intelligent film I've seen it did start showing potential when Diamond's character met Lionel. Unfortunately this opportunity to do something vaguely interested was blown away as soon as he freely admitted to being an angel. What followed was your usual Movie Land Christmas Sentimental fare. Snow ball fights, Christmas trees etc. As the film got closer to its end I found myself hoping that it would be allowed to finish with a little mystery or even perhaps an unconventional happy ending but that turned out to be wishful thinking. It soon became obvious that he would have to give up his own life which he did. Unfortunately though, the film makers pushed a little too hard for a happy ending which left us with the last minute, the most unbearable, saccharine filled conclusion I've seen in a while. In general the cast is below par. As another reviewer pointed out, Diamond's character is almost moronic at points and I still resent Lionel being so open about who he was so some of his rather poor jokes only compounded my dislike of him, Davis though gets to stand out with her acting. Overall it's no where near being great but it's a nice little movie to watch on a quiet winters afternoon, just make sure you switch it off once Reed Diamond has died. Great TV Christmas Movie, Could have easily been  released in theatres.; A few years ago, I turned on ABC family in hopes of being treated to a nice average quality holiday movie (mostly as a time killer). What I found was this film. I sat through the two hour movie and was kept glued to the TV every minute. After the two hours were over I had found a new Christmas classic. The story is about a literary agent Andrew Farmer (Reed Diamond), who during a business trip comes dangerously close to having an affair. He returns to his house on Christmas eve to find his wife Beth (Kristin Davis) who thinking he cheated, storms out of their apartment in anger, only to be hit by a car and killed. An angel (Tim Meadows) comes to Andrew and offers him of a very special gift. He will get to relive the last  days over again; however there is a catch. After those three days Beth will still die. But he can use that time to prove to her how much he loves her. During those  days they return to their home town and Andrew reconnects to a version of himself that he thought was long gone while rediscovering his love for his wife. But when the angel reappears and hints there may be a way to prevent the current course of events if he truly convinces his wife he still loves her, Andrew must race against the clock to find the perfect Christmas gift for her. One of the best things about this movie is the casting. Reed Diamond and Kristin Davis have great chemistry together, and it is really believable that they actually are husband and wife. Tim Meadows takes a drastic move from his usual comical roles and does a great job as the somber and wise angel who gives Andrew this magical gift. The movie may be a bit saccharine at times and it is a little predictable, but considering that it is made for TV and a Christmas movie (two genres that have overwhelmingly been dominated by garbage) the producers of this movie came out with flying colors. The only question is why they decided to make this straight to TV. Considering the quality, with a few tiny adjustments, this movie could have easily been released in theatres. Hopefully, ABC will wise up and release this one on DVD. Overall it was a great movie to watch during the holiday season and I recommend it to everyone. Definitely one of my favorite Christmas movies. wonderful!!!!; I thought this movie was truly wonderful, with the underlying theme that we must remember to show others how much we love them, because soon, it may be too late. i cried some, but i loved this so much. The actors were great, though i wasnt familiar with many of them. I would definitely recommend it if you love sad but sweet movies :-) movie; This movie is truly excellent! Every year my daughter and I watch this movie on Christmas Eve on ABC family, but for the last two years or so they have not played it.My daughter is really upset since it was a tradition we made when she was very little. So if any body could tell me where i can get this movie please let me know. If you are looking for a movie to snuggle up with your girlfriend,wife,daughter or son this is very much so the movie to do that with. It tells of the story about a man and his wife, and how he takes advantage of her love. It sends a very good message out to all ages. I would highly recommend Three Days to anybody wanting to know about a good, warm and comforting movie to watch on a Saturday night. A forced happy ending that's not prolly even necessary; Why are American filmmakers always compelled to force happy endings? This one's not even necessary (probably), but the producers must have felt it desperately needed, for they kept making the ending blatantly obvious, and more so as the movie went on. As for the movie, it got better towards the end as you feel more for the characters. I'd give it a B- just for potential. You'll be left wondering if YOU can do a better job, though. great..; Its a great movie for Ladies also for men, but in my opinion its more of a chick flick. No offense to anyone out there.... My advice: have a box of Kleenex next to you, when you watch it. It was well done/ well written. I just saw this movie last week for the first time in a while, it was terrific. Kristin Davis did an amazing job, like she always does. Tim Meadows also did a great job here. So did the other actors. :) The movie gives you drama, leaves you wondering whats going to happen next. It has good morals to it. It has a good ending. i totally think people should see this movie. Its great for the family. Saccharine; Watchable and feel-good in the \"It's a Wonderful Life\" style, but nowhere near as clever as It's a Wonderful Life. Stereotyped characters, script is sugary and predictable, a  year old could have written it. Overall, not one to pay to watch. It had everything you would expect from a sugary movie - an irritating angel, snow, Christmas trees, children and candy, saving a child's life (including a very bad demonstration of CPR - you wouldn't save anybody's life if you did it like that), childhood reminiscences, parental reconciliations, refusal to participate in an extra-marital affair, morality lessons etc, etc. We've seen this before; Wow. This movie was so predictable and it had so many plot holes. When a man's wife dies, he is given three days to be with her again and to prove her love to her. I knew exactly how the movie would end. By the way, the movie keeps getting cheesier as it goes. Yet, I gave this movie a decent  stars. The concept isn't bad, even though we've seen it before, but it is delivered as sappy, melodramatic, and of course predictable. Still, the acting is actually pretty good all around. I was especially impressed with Reed Diamond's performance. I'm also a big fan of Kristin Davis and she amazes me here! Tim Meadows is funny yet philosophical as the \"angel\". Yeah. \"It's A Wonderful Life, Part II.\" Still, the acting is good enough to keep this movie floating. Barely floating, though. A great feel good Christmas film.; I love this film. I saw it at Christmas in  on T.V. in England. My mum had just died  months before so i was very sad and grieving still. It was an emotional film but has an angel in it and a very good storyline. The timing of it was perfect for me and helped make me feel a little better. The acting is very good. It's the sort of film i wished they put on TV every Christmas. I recorded it as the review was good, so luckily i still have it on tape to watch. My  year old daughter likes it too. Hope you all enjoy it too. Sweet and entertaining...even if predictable; I really enjoyed this movie even if I could predict the ending. Actually, the predictability really only occurs in the last  minutes or so, so they almost had me believing it would end like it should. Even still, it's a nice, cozy movie to watch with a cup of cocoa. The story is about Beth and Andrew, a Boston couple. Andrew is a superbusy literary agent, and Beth is a yoga instructor. Clearly, differences in personalities. They've been together for  years when they lived in the little town of Mahone Bay back as kids. Anyway, as the story goes, Andrew is late for their tradition of picking a Christmas tree. He also drops on Beth that he has to fly to Chi on business on Christmas Eve. She's upset, but she knows that there's nothing she can say or do to change his mind. Now, what Andy doesn't tell her is that his colleague, Kimberly, is going along for the trip. Beth finds out when she calls his hotel and Kimberly answers the phone. Andy has a change of heart, and returns home to be with his wife... Beth is justifiably angry, and leaves the house. Andrew follows after her and witnesses her get hit by a car. At the hospital, the doctor gives grave news. Andrew returns home, and finds his key doesn't work. This leads him to the \"locksmith\" shop across the street. Here he meets Lionel (Tim Meadows) who after a conversation, grants him  more days (aka the last three days) with Beth in order to redo his damage. Beth is still scheduled to die on Christmas Eve, but Andrew is given a chance to prove to her that he loves her. So this is the set up. They spend the next  days visiting their hometown and reconnecting with their past. The typical overheard conversation occurs and that sends Beth back to Boston by herself (it's the Kimberly thing, only in a different setup). So Andrew, knowing his time w/her is running out,struggles w/how to prove it to her. Beth gives him some good news that she's been holding on to, but it doesn't change her destiny. The angel won't give him more time, but asks him if he would do anything to keep Beth from dying. You can probably predict what happens next. The beginning of the movie is basically reversed, right up until the last  minutes. Like I said, it's really predictable, but that doesn't ruin the enjoyment.   \n",
